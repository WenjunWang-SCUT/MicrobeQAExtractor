The bacteria are usually isolated from plants and soils. R. picketti, R. mannitolilytica and R. insidiosa have been recently regarded as pathogens of infectious diseases, especially as causable agents of nosocomial infection related to immunocompromised patients [1]. Contaminated solutions or water are believed to be the sources of Ralstonia nosocomial infections [1, 2]. The previous studies showed that most cases of infection were caused by R. picketti, with a few caused by R. mannitolilytica. The pathogens may cause bloodstream infection, pneumonia, peritonitis, meningitis, endocarditis, spinal osteitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and prostatitis. R. insidiosa was proposed as a new species in 2003 [3]. Bloodstream infection-related cases are extremely rare; none have been reported from Asia. In addition, further information concerning R. insidiosa, such as antimicrobial susceptibility, genomic profile and epidemiology, is also limited. Such information is clinically relevant, as R. insidiosa may have been underdiagnosed for the past several decades due to its low incidence. The bacterium could also easily be overlooked by researchers. Hence, in this study we described two cases of nosocomial bloodstream infection caused by R. insidiosa strains, including a carbapenems-resistant type."}]}]},{"species":"Rothia mucilaginosa","docs":[{"title":"[Paucisymptomatic pneumonia due to Rothia mucilaginosa: case report and literature review]","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Rothia mucilaginosa is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"226-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-positive","answer_start":26,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Rothia mucilaginosa normally exist?","id":"226-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"oral cavity and the upper respiratory tract in humans","answer_start":146,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Rothia mucilaginosa cause?","id":"226-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"pneumonia","answer_start":346,"id":1},{"text":"pneumonia","answer_start":451,"id":2},{"text":"pneumonia","answer_start":565,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Rothia mucilaginosa?","id":"226-1-1-4","answers":[{"text":"coccus","answer_start":93,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Rothia mucilaginosa is a Gram-positive, coagulase-negative, encapsulated, non-spore-forming coccus considered part of the commensal flora of the oral cavity and the upper respiratory tract in humans.

He described redness and swelling on the dorsum of his left foot. He denied trauma to the foot. He had been taking acetaminophen for pain intermittently without relief. He denied fever or chills, visual changes, back pain, muscle weakness, or numbness. He had a history of Streptococcus mitis mitral valve endocarditis and required mechanical mitral valve replacement in 2009. He had no history of peripheral vascular disease or claudication. He had no known drug allergies. His home medications included warfarin, methadone, and acetaminophen. He was an active intravenous heroin user. He was a former tobacco user with a 5-pack-year history who had quit 7 years before. On examination, the patient appeared well. His temperature was 100.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), pulse 108 beats per minute, blood pressure 133\/64 mm Hg, and respirations 20 per minute. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The dorsum of the left foot had mild erythema, slight edema, and point tenderness of the mid-dorsal region. The left dorsalis pedis pulse was easily palpable. Skin examination revealed track marks at the right antecubital fossa. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory studies revealed a white blood cell count of 20 \u00d7 10 cells\/mm (reference range, 4 \u00d7 10 to 11 \u00d7 10\/mm), neutrophils at 88%, creatinine at 0.8 mg\/dl, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 35 mm\/h (reference range, 0 to 10 mm\/h). Other routine laboratory tests were normal. A left-foot radiograph revealed no fracture, and an ultrasound of the left lower extremity revealed no deep vein thrombosis. Intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam were administered empirically for a presumptive diagnosis of left-foot cellulitis. The fever resolved, but the patient had persistent pain in the left foot, which subsequently turned blue and felt cold. Computed tomographic angiography revealed left popliteal artery thrombosis. A left popliteal thromboembolectomy was performed on day 4 of hospitalization. The pathology of the left popliteal thrombus revealed an organized thrombus with clusters of Gram-positive cocci. On day 4 of hospitalization, two sets of blood cultures obtained on the day of admission grew Rothia mucilaginosa from the aerobic bottles only. The organism was identified based upon biochemical tests, automated identification platforms (Phoenix system), and phenotypic characteristics. Gram stain revealed Gram-positive cocci that were catalase negative and grew sticky \u201cstaph-like\u201d colonies which were whitish to gray in color, nonhemolytic, smooth, and round (Fig. 1). Remel Bacticard strep reactions revealed positive results for l-leucine-beta-naphthylamide (LAP), l-pyroglutamyl-beta-naphthylamide (PYR), and esculin and ferric citrate (ESC). The BD Phoenix automated microbiology system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was used and revealed a 99% confidence value for Rothia mucilaginosa identification, with a profile number of 000003B284506FC6. Additional identification methods were not deemed necessary. (A) Growth on chocolate agar produced sticky colonies that adhered to the agar. (B) Growth on sheep blood agar produced sticky, \u201cstaph-like\u201d colonies that were whitish to gray in color, nonhemolytic, smooth, and round and exhibited the typical tenacious morphology of Rothia mucilaginosa. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed several mobile echodensities on the mechanical mitral valve prosthesis, with valve dehiscence, multiple areas of perforation, and paravalvular regurgitation. A diagnosis of R. mucilaginosa prosthetic valve endocarditis was made. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement on hospital day 14. The postoperative course was uneventful. The left foot appeared erythematous and warm, with less edema and tenderness. The patient was discharged to a subacute care facility on hospital day 26, with plans to complete a 6-week-total postoperative course of intravenous vancomycin (antimicrobial susceptibility results were unavailable at time of discharge). He was seen in the emergency department for an unrelated issue 1 week after antibiotic completion. During that visit, he was afebrile and had no clinical signs or symptoms of active infection. He was lost to follow-up thereafter. Subsequently, antimicrobial susceptibilities were reported. Susceptibility testing was performed using the AB Biodisk Etest. The MIC results demonstrated sensitivity to penicillin (0.016 \u03bcg\/ml), vancomycin (2.0 \u03bcg\/ml), ceftriaxone (0.016 \u03bcg\/ml), and daptomycin (2.0 \u03bcg\/ml). Rifampin testing was performed by the Kirby Bauer method using a BD BBL 5-\u03bcg rifampin disk. The zone size was 35 mm. Rothia mucilaginosa was formerly known as Staphylococcus salivarius, Micrococcus mucilaginosus, and Stomatococcus mucilaginosus. It was reclassified into a new genus belonging to the family Micrococcaceae in 2000 (1) based on 16S rRNA sequencing. The organism is an oxidase-negative, catalase-variable Gram-positive coccus bacterium. Gram staining reveals non-spore-forming, encapsulated Gram-positive cocci that can appear in pairs, tetrads, or irregular clusters. It is a facultative anaerobic bacterium which grows well on most nonselective media and in standard blood culture systems. On sheep blood and chocolate agar, the bacterium forms clear to gray\/white, nonhemolytic, mucoid or sticky colonies that adhere to the agar surface. It can be difficult to distinguish from coagulase-negative staphylococci, micrococci, and streptococci based on the catalase test result. Its inability to grow in 6.5% sodium chloride and its ability to hydrolyze gelatin and esculin distinguish it from species of the Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, and Enterococcus genera (2). Identification from automatic methods should correlate with phenotypic identification; otherwise, genetic sequencing may be needed to identify this organism. R. mucilaginosa is a normal inhabitant of the human oral cavity and respiratory tract (2). It is an infrequent pathogen, mostly affecting immunocompromised hosts, such as patients with cancer and severe neutropenia, human immunodeficiency virus infection, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, and chronic liver disease (3\u20135). Recently, infections in immunocompetent hosts have been reported with increasing frequency. Risk factors for this infection include intravenous drug abuse, cardiac valve disease, and the presence of prosthetic devices, especially prosthetic heart valves. Infections caused by this organism have been described in various organ systems, including patients with bacteremia (6), endovascular infection, (5, 7\u20139), central nervous system infection (10), ocular infection (11), bone and joint infection (12, 13), pulmonary infection (14), biliary tract infection (15), and skin and soft tissue infections (16). Endocarditis is by far the most commonly reported clinical manifestation caused by this organism. P\u00e9rez-Vega et al. reported a case series of R. mucilaginosa infective endocarditis in the literature. In this series, the typical patient with R. mucilaginosa endocarditis was a healthy patient with underlying cardiac disease or an intravenous drug abuser with prosthetic heart valves or mitral valve prolapse. In all patients, endocarditis affected the left-side valves, involving native valves and prosthetic valves almost equally. All patients with native-valve endocarditis recovered with antibiotic therapy alone. However, most patients with infected prosthetic heart valves required a combination of antibiotic therapy and surgical valve replacement (5). Table 1 describes 8 patients reported in the literature with prosthetic device infections caused by R. mucilaginosa (7\u20139, 17\u201319). The reported prosthetic devices include prosthetic heart valves (5 patients), a prosthetic hip (1 patient), a cerebral ventricle catheter (1 patient), and a peritoneal dialysis catheter (1 patient). Three of 5 (60%) patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis developed septic emboli. Six of 8 (75%) patients had a good outcome with antibiotic therapy combined with prosthetic device removal. Eight cases of Rothia mucilaginosa prosthetic device infections reported in the literature and our case Two of the 8 patients (25%) with prosthetic device infections died. Of the two patients who died, one had bioprosthetic mitral valve endocarditis complicated by septic emboli to the brain while receiving vancomycin, gentamicin, and rifampin therapy. Surgical valve replacement was considered; however, the patient had a cardiorespiratory arrest and expired on day 6 of hospitalization (8). The other death occurred in a patient who had aortic and mitral bioprosthetic valve endocarditis complicated by periaortic abscess and septic emboli to the brain. The patient deferred surgical valve replacement and expired after an 8-week course of vancomycin therapy (18). The pathogenesis of this organism in prosthetic device infection has not been well described. The organism's ability to produce a biofilm, similar to other Gram-positive bacteria, is believed to be a key pathogenic mechanism (20). The physical protective layer provided by the biofilm presumably facilitates adhesion of the organisms to devices and renders them relatively refractory to medical therapy. This biofilm likely causes local damage, such as disruption of prosthetic heart valves or loosening of implanted devices, or systemic manifestations, such as septic emboli. Antibiotic therapy alone is usually ineffective without surgical removal of the infected prosthetic device (21, 22). The patient we describe above illustrates the positive outcome utilizing a combination of antibiotic and surgical therapy. The optimal antimicrobial treatment of R. mucilaginosa infection has not been determined. The organism is generally susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, cefotaxime, imipenem, rifampin, and vancomycin. It is frequently resistant to clindamycin and aminoglycosides, as well as to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin (13). Daptomycin has in vitro activity against this organism (23). Partial resistance to penicillin has been reported in the literature (7, 19). Therefore, vancomycin is recommended as empirical therapy while awaiting susceptibility testing. In summary, R. mucilaginosa is increasingly recognized as an emerging opportunistic pathogen associated with prosthetic device infections. It may be difficult to identify and can easily be mistaken for staphylococci or streptococci. When this organism causes clinical infection, prosthetic valve endocarditis is not uncommon. A combination of antibiotic therapy and prompt removal of the infected device is probably necessary for a successful outcome. Physicians should be aware of this organism when treating patients infected with Gram-positive bacteria associated with prosthetic devices."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Rothia mucilaginosa is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"226-2-3-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-positive","answer_start":5121,"id":1},{"text":"Gram-positive","answer_start":5207,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does R. mucilaginosa normally exist?","id":"226-2-3-2","answers":[{"text":"human oral cavity and respiratory tract","answer_start":6087,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can R. mucilaginosa cause?","id":"226-2-3-3","answers":[{"text":"prosthetic device infections","answer_start":7786,"id":1},{"text":"prosthetic device infections","answer_start":8283,"id":2},{"text":"prosthetic device infections","answer_start":10512,"id":3},{"text":"prosthetic valve endocarditis","answer_start":3734,"id":4},{"text":"bacteremia (6), endovascular infection, (5, 7\u20139), central nervous system infection (10), ocular infection (11), bone and joint infection (12, 13), pulmonary infection (14), biliary tract infection (15), and skin and soft tissue infections","answer_start":6721,"id":5},{"text":"Endocarditis","answer_start":6966,"id":6},{"text":"Endocarditis","answer_start":7223,"id":7}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are R. mucilaginosa sensitive to?","id":"226-2-3-4","answers":[{"text":"penicillin, ampicillin, cefotaxime, imipenem, rifampin, and vancomycin","answer_start":9964,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are R. mucilaginosa resistant to?","id":"226-2-3-5","answers":[{"text":"clindamycin and aminoglycosides, as well as to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin","answer_start":10066,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Rothia mucilaginosa's requirement for oxygen?","id":"226-2-3-6","answers":[{"text":"facultative anaerobic","answer_start":5293,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Rothia mucilaginosa?","id":"226-2-3-7","answers":[{"text":"coccus","answer_start":5135,"id":1},{"text":"cocci that can appear in pairs, tetrads, or irregular clusters","answer_start":5221,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"A 36-year-old man was admitted to the hospital in January 2012 with a chief complaint of left foot pain for 1 week.

This intracellular organism was considered to be the causative pathogen of the pneumonia by combined analysis of the quantitative culture and visualization of ICOs. The patient' s chest radiograph and CT scan indicated likely atypical pneumonia, and the BAL specimen was also positive for rhinovirus. Therefore rhinovirus could not be ruled out as a causative agent of pneumonia. However, considering the purulent BAL specimen, we believed that the bacteria played at least a partially pathogenic role, and the patient was treated with antimicrobial therapy. The predominant growth of R. mucilaginosa in the BAL specimens with rare epithelial cells was not likely due to contamination by the normal oropharyngeal flora. There have been fewer than 20 cases of lower respiratory tract infection caused by R. mucilaginosa reported worldwide [9], and the clinical manifestation of disease have ranged from mild bronchitis to pneumonia or recurrent lung abscesses [6]. However, it is difficult to determine the clinical significance of R. mucilaginosa when it is found in respiratory specimens. The diagnosis of pneumonia caused by R. mucilaginosa requires at least a culture from the bronchoscopic specimen [6, 9]. In this case, the quantitative cultures from the BAL specimen provided more than 10 CFU\/mL, which was enough to diagnose the causative agents of pneumonia [11]. These culture findings supported R. mucilaginosa as a true pathogen. In this case, analysis of the direct smear revealed significant numbers of macrophages and neutrophils engulfing gram-positive cocci in clusters as ICOs. The quantitative cultures of the BAL specimen grew organisms with the same morphology as these ICOs. Detecting ICOs in the BAL fluid is an early indication of an infectious pulmonary process [12, 13], and a cytologic study of the BAL specimen to identify ICOs would allow us to determine the causative agents of nosocomial pneumonia [14]. Quantitative cultures of the BAL specimens show moderate correlation with the percentage of ICOs in the specimen, which in turn correlates with the lung bacterial burden [13]. The percentage of neutrophils that contain ICOs is higher in patients with pneumonia than in those without pneumonia [14]; the cut-off varies from 1% to more than 20% [14]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\/National Healthcare Safety Network recommends 5% as a critical value for pneumonia diagnosis [15]. There are no previous reports of pneumonia due to R. mucilaginosa that was diagnosed by quantitative analysis of BAL cultures and ICOs. We identified R. mucilaginosa using the API Staph Identification Panel (bioM\u00e9rieux SA). Several other commercial kits are available for the identification of R. mucilaginosa; however, their accuracy for this rarely isolated species has been questioned [12, 16]. Because R. mucilaginosa is not a common pathogen in respiratory specimens, we confirmed the identification by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The morphology of this organism was consistent with its identification as R. mucilaginosa, which is an encapsulated gram-positive coccus found in pairs, clusters, and tetrads, with colonies that are mucoid, rubbery, or sticky in consistency and adherent to agar [1, 16, 17]. The isolate was resistant to gentamicin, clindamycin, and levofloxacin. R. mucilaginosa has a variety of antimicrobial susceptibilities [6, 17-19]. Although the interpretation of antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not standardized, third-generation cephalosporins, vancomycin, high-dose ampicillin, rifampin, and chloramphenicol are consistently active against this bacterium [4, 17]. R. mucilaginosa has a broad range of susceptibility to other agents such as penicillin, clindamycin, and erythromycin [17]. Therefore, the susceptibility pattern of this isolate was generally consistent with that of R. mucilaginosa from previous reports [20, 21]. When the MIC breakpoints for Corynebacterium spp. were applied in this case [10], the organism was susceptible to penicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefepime, meropenem, trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, vancomycin, and imipenem. The other antimicrobials were interpreted according to the MIC breakpoints for Staphylococcus spp. [22]; the pathogen was susceptible to ampicillin, amoxicillin\/clavulanate, azithromycin, chloramphenicol, cefuroxime, and piperacillin\/tazobactam, and resistant to levofloxacin. We can speculate on the emergence of acquired resistance to fluoroquinolones because the patient had a history of ciprofloxacin treatment. There are previous reports of emerging resistance of R. mucilaginosa to ciprofloxacin [18] and trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole [5] in association with prophylactic antimicrobial therapy. The variable susceptibility of R. mucilaginosa to \u03b2-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones dictates that the choice of antimicrobial agents should be guided by individual susceptibility tests in cases of severe infection. Rifampin, penicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and clarithromycin have been previously used to treat R. mucilaginosa pneumonia [6]. Although in our case the isolate was resistant to levofloxacin, the pneumonia improved after levofloxacin therapy. Levofloxacin can be concentrated in respiratory tissues and intracellular compartments [23, 24] and is the treatment of choice for community-acquired pneumonia. In our case, levofloxacin may have been more active than in vitro susceptibility results on ICOs would have led us to expect. Outcomes of R. mucilaginosa pneumonia treated with levofloxacin are generally favorable, but non-attributable mortality has been found in patients with serious underlying disease [6, 7, 9]. In conclusion, this is the first description of pneumonia caused by R. mucilaginosa in Korea. This case indicates that quantitative analysis of BAL culture and ICOs are useful for diagnosing pneumonia caused by R. mucilaginosa."}]},{"title":"Rothia mucilaginosa Meningitis in a Child with Myelodysplastic Syndromes","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Rothia mucilaginosa is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"226-4-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-positive","answer_start":25,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Rothia mucilaginosa?","id":"226-4-1-2","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":53,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Rothia mucilaginosa?","id":"226-4-1-3","answers":[{"text":"coccus","answer_start":39,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Rothia mucilaginosa cause?","id":"226-4-1-4","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia meningitis or endocarditis","answer_start":175,"id":1},{"text":"febrile neutropenia and bacterial meningitis","answer_start":591,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Rothia mucilaginosa is a Gram-positive coccus and an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised hosts.

Bone marrow transplant or chemotherapy in the treatment of MDS induces not only long-term neutropenia but also extensive mucositis. Chavan et al. reported 11 children who developed clinically significant R. mucilaginosa infections, including three deaths, directly attributable to the microorganism [5]. Almost all patients had severe neutropenia, central-line catheters, and mucosal breakdown at the time of infection. They described that R. mucilaginosa can lead to life-threatening infections in immunocompromised hosts, especially in profoundly neutropenic patients [2, 4, 5]. Our patient had the risk factors of R. mucilaginosa infection, such as severe neutropenia, central-line catheter use, and mucosal breakdown at the time of infection, that were reported in previous studies [5, 6]. Recently, high-dose ampicillin, third-generation cephalosporins, rifampin, chloramphenicol, and VCM have been reported to be active in the treatment of invasive R. mucilaginosa infections [2, 4, 7, 8]. As R. mucilaginosa meningitis is rare and only a few cases have been reported, no guidelines have been established to assist in antibiotic selection for the treatment of invasive Rothia infections. Accordingly, the most effective antibiotics for R. mucilaginosa meningitis are unknown. Choosing adequate antibiotics is important because antimicrobial agents penetrate the blood-brain barrier less when little or no meningeal inflammation is present in patients with neutropenia. In addition, repeated or prolonged exposure to prophylactic or therapeutic broad-spectrum antibiotics may lead to the selection of pathogenic germs [4]. These factors make R. mucilaginosa meningitis treatment more difficult. Lee et al. described the clinical characteristics of 16 immunocompromised patients who developed meningitis from R. mucilaginosa [4]. On the basis of a literature review, they recommended the addition of high-dose ampicillin and rifampin as first-line therapies against R. mucilaginosa meningitis. Ramanan et al. also reported that all R. mucilaginosa isolates were susceptible to penicillin, MEPM, and VCM, but 33% were oxacillin resistant [2]. However, recently, Kayman et al. reported that isolates from patients with bacteremia were resistant to beta-lactams and susceptible to VCM [9]. Moreover, Getzenberg et al. also reported that the antibiotic susceptibility of R. mucilaginosa isolates were 3% for penicillin, 0% for oxacillin, 76% for CEZ, 73% for MEPM, and 100% for VCM [7]. All the cases were successfully treated with VCM. Maraki et al. reviewed 19 published cases (n = 20) of R. mucilaginosa pneumonia. VCM alone or in combination with other antibiotics have been successfully used for the treatment of R. mucilaginosa pneumonia [10]. On the basis of these data, they recommended the administration of VCM as a first-line therapy against invasive R. mucilaginosa infection cases. From now on, owing to the increasing number of reported cases of relative penicillin resistance, other agents are increasingly needed. DAP is used to treat patients with GPC bacteremia or meningitis as empirical therapy. Recently, because R. mucilaginosa isolates with high MICs to DAP were observed, caution is required when treating R. mucilaginosa infection with DAP. Bruminhent et al. described that the MIC of DAP was 2.0 \u03bcg\/mL in their case isolate [11]. We retrospectively reviewed the antimicrobial susceptibility of all R. mucilaginosa isolates (n = 5) from blood or CSF cultures at our hospital between January 2016 and December 2020 (Table 1), revealing that some strains were resistant to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, including ABPC. Moreover, the MICs of VCM and LZD were <0.5 \u03bcg\/mL for all strains, whereas the MIC of DAP was \u22652 \u03bcg\/mL for all strains. The MIC of MEPM was >1 \u03bcg\/mL for one strain. Clinical features and distribution of the MICs against antimicrobials of Rothia mucilaginosa isolated in our hospital. Presented case. ALL, acute lymphoid leukemia; AML, acute myeloid leukemia; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; F, female; M, male; MDS, myelodysplastic syndromes; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; y, year. In our case series, the antibiotic susceptibility of R. mucilaginosa isolates was 60% for penicillin, 60% for ABPC, 60% for CEZ, 80% for MEPM, and 100% for VCM. The antimicrobial susceptibility results differed among the isolates. Breakthrough GPC bacteremia or meningitis in patients treated with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics or DAP may reflect emergence of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics or DAP nonsusceptibility in the infecting isolate. Different results regarding the antibiotic susceptibility of R. mucilaginosa have been reported by various authors [2\u201311]. However, the reasons for the differences in the antibiotic susceptibility pattern among R. mucilaginosa isolates are not clear. Further research is needed to analyze microbiological and clinical features, including underlying disease, antimicrobial treatment, or oral and gastrointestinal flora. In summary, we recommend that VCM should be chosen as the primary treatment for invasive R. mucilaginosa infections until antimicrobial susceptibility results are known, especially in immunocompromised children."}]}]},{"species":"Rothia dentocariosa","docs":[{"title":"Rothia dentocariosa Endocarditis: An Especially Rare Case in a Previously Healthy Man","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Rothia dentocariosa is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"227-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-positive","answer_start":31,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Rothia dentocariosa normally exist?","id":"227-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"mouth and respiratory tract","answer_start":123,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can R. dentocariosa cause?","id":"227-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"bacterial endocarditis","answer_start":366,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Rothia dentocariosa is a rare gram-positive bacterial organism, one of the group of microbes that normally resides in the mouth and respiratory tract.

Two diseased geese were randomly selected for diagnosis, and bacteria were isolated from the liver. The bacteria isolated were identified as Rothia nasimurium, which have not been reported in geese before. Rothia nasimurium, from the family Micrococcaceae, was isolated and named by Collins et al. in 2000 [1]. It is a Gram-positive facultative anaerobic cocci. The bacterium was isolated from the nose of a healthy mouse; therefore, it was named Rothia nasimurium. Members of the genus Rothia are commonly regarded as part of the normal flora of the oral and intestinal tract of humans, pigs, and rodents [2,3,4]. In 2011, Li isolated a strain of Rothia nasimurium (No. 91) from the air of a farm, which presented high-level resistance to all tested antibiotics except vancomycin and had never been seen among all airborne bacteria and had not been reported in Rothia previously [5]. In 2014, Bemis et al. [6] isolated a strain from a dog\u2019s skin lesions, tonsils, external ear canal, and semen, which caused strong synergistic hemolysis with Staphylococcus colonies in primary culture. This indicated that Rothia nasimurium is an opportunistic pathogen. In 2015, Hansen et al. isolated Rothia nasimurium in anser albifrons\u2019s eggs, which was the first time that Rothia species were reported to have been found in bird eggs [7]. In 2017, another strain of Rothia nasimurium was isolated from the tonsils of healthy piglets by Gaiser et al., who found that the isolate could inhibit the growth of multiple strains and serotypes of the porcine pathogen Streptococcus suis. That was the first report of a normal bacterium from mammal-associated microbiota that contained a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster encoding a valinomycin-type nonribosomal peptide [8]. In 2021, Wang et al. isolated the E1706032a strain of Rothia nasimurium, which displayed wide antibiotic resistance and dissemination potential via mobile elements and was claimed to have the potential to cause difficult-to-treat infections in animals and humans [9]. In the same year, Zhao et al. isolated a strain of Rothia nasimurium from a rabbit and reported that it could cause disease [10]. However, little attention has been paid to Rothia nasimurium, which is essential for further study. In this study, a strain of Rothia nasimurium was isolated from diseased geese, which suggested that Rothia nasimurium is able to infect geese and make them ill. Consequently, we carried out a series of studies to further explore the characteristics of this bacterium, with the aim of reducing its potential harm to the geese."},{"qas":[{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Rothia nasimurium?","id":"228-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":246,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Rothia nasimurium sensitive to?","id":"228-1-3-2","answers":[{"text":"amikacin","answer_start":1016,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"In previous reports, Rothia nasimurium was identified and isolated as part of the normal flora in animals.

In the present study, a strain of Rothia nasimurium was identified in diseased geese, which enriches our knowledge of pathogenic microorganism species in geese. The result of the antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that the isolated strain has strong drug resistance, which means it may become a potential threat to public health. The increase of antimicrobial resistance is a global problem for both human and animal health. The goose industry must perform well in terms of environmental disinfection and sterilization [24,25]. At the same time, targeted therapy is also essential because of its higher treatment efficiency [26,27]. Through the antibiotic susceptibility testing, amikacin was identified as the most effective antibiotic against Rothia nasimurium. This result provides accurate guidance for clinical antibiotic use, allowing more targeted treatment and reducing the abuse of antibiotics. In addition, the mechanism by cefazolin that acts as the only effective antibiotic in the beta-lactam group requires further investigation. Increased drug resistance of bacteria could be effectively avoided through targeted therapy [28,29,30]. At the same time, the evolution and spread of bacterial drug resistance could be reduced [31]. The result of the animal regression experiment showed that the clinical and pathological signs of the infected goslings were highly similar to those naturally infected geese, and the bacteria could be isolated from the liver and blood again after injection and oral administration. This means that the bacteria can penetrate the body\u2019s immune barrier and pose a health threat, so geese breeders should not ignore the potential harm caused by Rothia nasimurium. Furthermore, the serious depilation of the goslings caused by its infection was unexpected and intrigued the researchers.

Therefore, the mechanism of depilation of goslings deserves an in-depth study."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Rothia nasimurium sensitive to?","id":"228-1-4-1","answers":[{"text":"amikacin","answer_start":345,"id":1},{"text":"cefazolin, fosfomycin, and ampicillin\/sulbactam","answer_start":355,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"In this study, a strain of Rothia nasimurium was found to be able to survive and cause disease in geese; it could also cause serious depilation of goslings, suggesting that it has potential to harm geese or other animals.

With advanced phylogenetic testing including 16S rRNA and rpoB sequence analysis, the genus Klebsiella was further divided into two genera. Thus, in 2001, the genus Raoultella was created and species included in the cluster II of the genus Klebsiella were transferred and renamed to the new genus. The Raoultella genus is named after Didier Raoult, a French bacteriologist from the Universit\u00e9 de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e in Marseille, France. R. ornithinolytica has been found in water environments, soil, insects, fish, ticks and termites. This bacterium converts histidine to histamine causing histamine poisoning with cutaneous flushing, better known as the scombroid syndrome associated with fish poisoning. In addition to skin flushing, this syndrome may cause vomiting, diarrhea, headache or pruritus depending on the quantity of ingested histamine. This syndrome is mainly associated with \u201cscombroid\u201d fish belonging to the Scombridae and Scomberesocidae families where exogenous microbial decarboxylation of histidine occurs. The incidence of human disease associated with R. ornithinolytica is low with few previously reported cases of clinical infections requiring treatment. The low prevalence of R. ornithinolytica related infections in the literature might be explained by the challenges and difficulty to properly identify this species with conventional biochemical and phenotypic tests. Similarly to other members of the Enterobacterales order, such as Aeromonas, Plesiomonas and Leclercia and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria, such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia complex and Alcaligenes faecalis, due to the scarcity of reported cases, the associated pathogenicity and antibiotic susceptibility testing remain overlooked.

The genus Veillonella was first isolated by Veillon and Zuber in 1898 and currently consists of eight species (28). Veillonella species have been reported as causes of serious infections, including meningitis (6), osteomyelitis and discitis (7, 28), prosthetic joint infection (26), and acute and chronic pleuropulmonary infection (33). Risk factors for Veillonella infection include periodontal disease, immunodeficiency, intravenous drug use, and premature birth (28). V. parvula is an important pathogen implicated in periodontitis and other dental infections (3, 18), and it is one of the most common anaerobic pathogens in chronic maxillary sinusitis and deep neck infections (9, 37). V. parvula has also been reported as a pathogen for osteomyelitis (34) and abscessed orchiepididymitis with sepsis (4). Endovascular infections reportedly may range from bacteremia to severe endocarditis and fatal cases of sepsis (8, 14, 25). Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are major pathogenic factors of gram-negative bacteria. LPS from aerobic and facultative bacteria have been extensively studied (5). On the contrary, very little is known regarding the biological activity of LPS from anaerobic microorganisms such as Veillonella (10, 24, 29, 32). In addition, little is known about cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for innate immune response against V. parvula, as well as for inflammatory reactions leading to severe periodontitis or sinusitis. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize microbial compounds (36) and trigger the inflammatory and immune responses against pathogens. Immunohistochemical localization of TLR2 and TLR4 in gingival tissue of periodontitis patients has been reported (30). In mammals, engagement of TLRs by LPS results in the recruitment of cytoplasmic signaling molecules (12, 36), which eventually activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including p38, JNK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). MAPK activation leads to cytokine release (2). However, the interaction between oral V. parvula LPS and TLRs has not been directly studied yet. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of TLR2 and TLR4 for the recognition of Veillonella parvula LPS in both human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and in TLR2 and TLR4 knockout (KO) mouse macrophages, as well as the intracellular kinase signaling pathways induced after challenge of monocytes with Veillonella parvula LPS."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can V. parvula cause?","id":"232-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"both dental\/periodontal diseases (3, 18) and joint disorders","answer_start":2686,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"In the present paper we demonstrate that V. parvula LPS is recognized by TLR4 in both humans and mice and that the activation of MAP kinases plays an important role in V. parvula LPS-stimulated human PBMC signaling. Previous studies on the in vitro and in vivo activities of the LPS from Veillonella parvula demonstrated that such an endotoxin has biological effects comparable to enterobacterial LPS (10, 29). Earlier studies reported on fibroblast collagenase-inducing PBMC cytokines stimulated by Veillonella spp. LPS; however, such cytokines were not directly evaluated (16). Formalin-killed V. parvula has been demonstrated to induce the release of IL-1\u03b2 in human blood monocytes at levels comparable to those released by Porphryomonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, and Prevotella intermedia (27). More recent investigations showed that the concentrations of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10 released from umbilical cord and adult mononuclear cells following in vitro challenge with UV-killed V. parvula were comparable or even higher than cytokine concentrations evaluated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa- and E. coli-stimulated cord and adult cells (19). The lower cytokine production of PBMC induced by Veillonella LPS (approximately 20 to 30% of that induced by E. coli LPS) is mirrored in the type of pathology induced by these microorganisms. On the one hand, gram-negative sepsis with enterobacteriaceae induces a superacute inflammatory reaction, followed sometimes by organ failure and even death. On the other hand, Veillonella is present in the mouth flora and is an important pathogen of periodontal disease, a chronic inflammatory condition. Thus, the low cytokine production by Veillonella is certainly important in inducing the low-grade inflammation in periodontitis. To the best of our knowledge, very few papers have reported on the role of TLRs for the pathogenesis of Veillonella infection. In one study treatment of dendritic cells with an anti-TLR4 antibody decreased cytokine production induced by UV-treated V. parvula (20), but the nature of the Veillonella ligand recognized by TLR4 was not identified. Similarly, TLR2- and TLR4-transfected human embryonic kidney cells responded to sonicated Veillonella bacteria stimulation (21). In both these studies, Veillonella seemed to stimulate both TLR4 and TLR2. However, the bacterial product responsible for the TLR engagement was not addressed, and the models used were only from murine species. In the present study, we demonstrate that V. parvula LPS is recognized by TLR4 in both human and murine cells, and we show the MAPK role in Veillonella LPS-stimulated human PBMC signaling. V. parvula has been implicated in both dental\/periodontal diseases (3, 18) and joint disorders (26). Periodontal disease and rheumatoid arthritis have remarkably similar inflammatory mediator profiles (22). Within periodontal lesions, activated monocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts produce cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, which have been found to be significantly elevated in diseased periodontal sites compared with healthy or inactive sites (11). These cytokines orchestrate the cascade of destructive events that occur in the periodontal tissues and trigger the production of an array of inflammatory enzymes and mediators, resulting in irreversible hard and soft tissue damage (15). By exploiting an in vitro model of periodontal diseases, it has been found that upregulation of IL-6 by lipopolysaccharide treatment is TLR4 dependent. This pattern of gene expression indicates that pathogens may trigger TLR4 signaling and cause periodontitis (35). Therefore, our present findings may have sound clinical impact. Moreover, due to the similarity of pathogenesis between periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis, antagonists of TLR4, as well as p38 inhibitors, have the potential to ameliorate progression of periodontal disease (23), rheumatic pathologies, and other chronic inflammatory\/degenerative disorders. The TLR4 antagonist B. quintana LPS (31) has been demonstrated to dramatically improve the evolution of experimental arthritis in the mouse (1). Further studies are warranted in order to exploit the modulation of TLR4 and p38 MAPK in the therapy of chronic inflammatory\/degenerative diseases."}]},{"title":"Veillonella parvula meningitis: case report and review of Veillonella infections","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Veillonella parvula is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"232-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-negative","answer_start":59,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Veillonella parvula normally exist?","id":"232-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina in humans","answer_start":120,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can V. parvula cause?","id":"232-2-1-3","answers":[{"text":"meningitis","answer_start":391,"id":1},{"text":"meningitis","answer_start":543,"id":2},{"text":"infections of the sinuses, lungs, heart, bone, and central nervous system","answer_start":316,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Veillonella parvula's requirement for oxygen?","id":"232-2-1-4","answers":[{"text":"anaerobic","answer_start":49,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Veillonella parvula?","id":"232-2-1-5","answers":[{"text":"coccus","answer_start":73,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Veillonella parvula is a small, nonfermentative anaerobic gram-negative coccus that is part of the normal flora of the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina in humans.

The V. atypica strains harbored four main Cas proteins, namely, CAS-Type IIIA, CAS-Type IIA, CAS-Type IIC, and CAS-Type IIID. This pilot study provides an in-depth understanding of and a fundamental knowledge about the biology of V. atypica that allow the possibility to increase the biotechnological potential of this bacterium."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Veillonella atypica is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"233-1-2-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":89,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does V. atypica normally exist?","id":"233-1-2-2","answers":[{"text":"intestines and the oral mucosa of mammals","answer_start":468,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can V. atypica cause?","id":"233-1-2-3","answers":[{"text":"pulmonary infection","answer_start":1086,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Veillonella atypica's requirement for oxygen?","id":"233-1-2-4","answers":[{"text":"anaerobic","answer_start":117,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Veillonella atypica?","id":"233-1-2-5","answers":[{"text":"coccus","answer_start":127,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Veillonella atypica, which belongs to family Veillonellaceae and genus Veillonella, is a Gram-negative bacterium and anaerobic coccus. To date, species of genus Veillonella, including V. atypica, but with the exception of Veillonella seminalis (Aujoulat et al., 2014), are well known for their lactate fermenting abilities, allowing them to utilize lactate and transform it to propionate and acetate (Kolenbrander, 2006). The strains of V. atypica can be found in the intestines and the oral mucosa of mammals (Beighton et al., 2008; Vesth et al., 2013) and play diverse roles in different niches. For example, the coaggregation properties of Veillonella spp. of the human oral cavity affect the colonization site and the ecology of oral microbial communities (Hughes et al., 1988). Moreover, oral Veillonella spp., including V. atypica, together with Streptococcus spp., are known as early colonizers in oral biofilm formation and affect the development of dental plaques (Mashima and Nakazawa, 2015). A case report stated that V. atypica, along with Actinomyces odontolyticus, led to pulmonary infection in a 65-year-old, male immunocompetent patient with dental caries (Crisafulli et al., 2019). Besides that, metal reduction by microbes has attracted increased attention (Lloyd, 2003), and numerous microorganisms with the ability to reduce metals have been isolated, identified, and studied (Zhang et al., 2019a, b; Wang et al., 2020). As a metal-reducing bacterium, V. atypica has been identified as a selenium-respiring bacterium and possesses the ability to transform biogenic selenite (Se) (Nancharaiah and Lens, 2015). V. atypica reduces Se(IV) by using hydrogen as electron donors and involves a metal-reducing mechanism different from that of Geobacter sulfurreducens and Shewanella oneidensis (Pearce et al., 2009). Following the effective detoxification of Cr(VI) via a sulfur-based mixotrophic bio-reduction process (Zhang et al., 2020), bioengineering of V. atypica strains will increase their potential applications as selenium-respiring bacterium with an important role in the selenium cycle. However, the genes and\/or proteins associated with this mechanism remain elusive. Understanding the functional traits of genes and\/or proteins of V. atypica will be beneficial in increasing the ability of this species to transform biogenic selenite. Additionally, a study found that the relative abundance of gut Veillonella is significantly associated with marathon running and V. atypica gavage improves treadmill run time in mice (Scheiman et al., 2019). The mechanism involves crossing of serum lactate from the epithelial barrier into the gut lumen, and then the gut V. atypica transforms lactate to acetate and propionate, which is sufficient to improve treadmill run time (Scheiman et al., 2019). Therefore, understanding the genetic diversity and the functional characteristics of V. atypica will expand its biotechnological applications in environmental restoration and exercise performance. To date, nine V. atypica strains, namely, V. atypica KON, V. atypica CMW7756B, V. atypica ACS-049-V-Sch6, V. atypica ACS-134-V-Col7a, V. atypica KON ATCC 17744, V. atypica NCTC11830, V. atypica AF36-15BH, V. atypica KHUD_V1, and V. atypica OK5, have been sequenced and their genome sequences can be available in public database. The genome of strain V. atypica OK5 was the first to be completely sequenced among the V. atypica strains. This strain was isolated from a human saliva sample to reveal the genetic transformability among the species of Veillonella genus. Based on the complete genome sequence of V. atypica OK5, a genetic study provided an in-depth understanding of the ecology of human oral biofilms (Zhou et al., 2015). The genome sequences of the other eight strains are incomplete. A study of the genetic diversity of genus Veillonella and 137 prokaryotic genomes, including eight Veillonella spp., suggested that the genus Veillonella is relatively homogeneous (Vesth et al., 2013). However, the genetic diversity and the functional traits of V. atypica, especially concerning the composition of carbohydrate-active enzymes (known as CAZy enzymes or CAZymes) and CRISPR\u2013Cas system, which is widely used in editing the genetic elements of microbiota (Alkhnbashi et al., 2019; Horvath and Barrangou, 2010), remain unclear. Hence, a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of V. atypica is warranted. In this study, we collected the available genomic datasets of nine V. atypica strains and conducted a comparative analysis to investigate the strains\u2019 genetic diversity, functional traits, including CAZyme, Cluster of Orthologous Group (COG), Gene Ontology (GO) function, and metabolic pathways, and CRISPR\u2013Cas composition. The results revealed differences in the genetic features of these strains and demonstrated that V. atypica exhibited an open pan-genome structure. The evolutionary trees of nine V. atypica strains constructed with two different strategies showed that the nine V. atypica strains can be divided into two clusters, and V. atypica OK5 may not the suitable representative strain for V. atypica. The differences in the ability of the strains to utilize carbohydrates were derived from the CAZyme component of accessory clusters. Several proteins of V. atypica were annotated to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways involved in antibiotic resistance and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. The V. atypica strains harbored four main Cas proteins, namely, CAS-Type IIIA, CAS-Type IIA, CAS-Type IIC, and CAS-Type IIID."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of drugs are V. atypica resistant to?","id":"233-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"vancomycin","answer_start":18849,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"In general, the use of complete genomes is recommended for estimating the genetic diversity in pan-genome analysis, and the mixture of complete and draft genomes is also allowed in pan-genome analysis (Veras et al., 2018). For example, the genetic diversity of Corallococcus was evaluated on the basis of two complete genomes and 21 draft genomes of Corallococcus strains via pan-genome analysis (Livingstone et al., 2018), and the 11 genomes (five complete and six draft genomes) were used to obtain a first approximation of the Piscirickettsia salmonis pan-genome (Bravo and Martinez, 2016). Therefore, in this present study, to conduct the comparative analysis of species V. atypica, nine available genomic datasets, including complete and draft genomes, and their corresponding protein datasets for V. atypica strains were collected and downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Except for V. atypica OK5, the sequenced genomes of the V. atypica strains were mainly assembled at contig and scaffold levels, and the number of scaffolds ranged from 1 to 94. The assembled genome of V. atypica ranged from 1.99 to 2.19 Mb, whereas the protein number of V. atypica ranged from 1,781 to 1,973 (Table 1). The results showed that the nine V. atypica strains were mainly isolated from the oral cavity, vagina, and feces of Homo sapiens (Table 1). It is important to note that although this study is limited in that the pan-genome analysis was performed with a restricted quantity of fully sequenced genomes, the genetic diversity and the characteristics of V. atypica were explored with mainstream databases and tools of pan-genome analysis, which was used to evaluate the genetic diversity and the functional traits of Aeromonas (Zhong et al., 2019) and Shewanella (Zhong et al., 2018) via pan-genome analysis. This pilot study is an important step toward understanding the functional traits and the functional variants of V. atypica. Genomic datasets of the nine Veillonella atypica strains used in this study. The genomic features of the nine V. atypica strains were collected from National Center for Biotechnology Information. To characterize the differences in genomic features among these nine V. atypica strains, the orthologs were identified from 16,948 high-quality proteins of V. atypica. A total of 2,065 homologous clusters were identified from V. atypica strains. Among these homologous clusters, 1,512 homologous clusters (73.22%) were found in all the nine V. atypica strains and accordingly identified as the core genome of V. atypica (Figure 1A). In addition, 1,468 homologous clusters from the core genome were identified as single-copy core families. The number of accessory families of V. atypica ranged from 199 to 376 (Figure 1A), whereas 13 homologous clusters were identified as specific families (unique genes) for the nine V. atypica strains, the number of specific families of which ranged from 0 to 4. Interestingly, no specific families were found in the strains of V. atypica KON and V. atypica KON ATCC 17744. Additionally, the number of genes in the specific families of the other V. atypica strains were all more than two, suggesting that these multi-copy specific genes may play an important role in the adaptation of the V. atypica strains to specific niches. Genetic diversity in Veillonella atypica strains. (A) Core, accessory, and specific gene families of the nine V. atypica strains. The number of core genomes shared by all strains is in the center (1,512). The number of non-overlapping portions of each oval represents the size of specific families (unique genes). The number of accessory families of each strain is shown in parentheses after the strain name. (B) The size of pan-genome (top) and core genome (bottom) shared by different strains, respectively. Phylogenetic relationship of nine V. atypica strains. (C) Phylogenetic tree based on all single-copy protein sequences. (D) The UPGMA tree of Manhattan distance based on the pan-genome composition of the nine V. atypica strains. Moreover, the accumulation curve of homologous clusters has just reached the plateau stage, which suggested that V. atypica exhibited an open pan-genome structure (Figure 1B). With the emergence of new V. atypica strains, the pan-genome size of V. atypica tended to increase gradually, whereas the core genome size of V. atypica tended to decrease progressively. Moreover, the pan-genome and the core-genome sizes of V. atypica were estimated to be 2,065 and 1,512 non-redundant genes within the nine V. atypica strains, respectively (Figure 1B). The distribution of the core, accessory, and specific genes revealed that the genomes of the V. atypica strains were remarkably diverse. To compare the similarity and the distance of the V. atypica strains and gain insights into the evolutionary relationship of these nine V. atypica strains, two strategies were applied to construct the phylogenetic trees and explore the phylogenetic relationships among the nine V. atypica strains. One strategy was based on the protein sequences of concatenated alignments of 1,468 single-copy core genes shared by the nine V. atypica strains (Figure 1C). This strategy can eliminate the effects of genome size and sequencing quality. The other strategy was based on the Manhattan distance between the nine V. atypica strains. The distance was calculated on the basis of the absence or the presence of each protein homolog (Figure 1D). Although the information from NCBI BioSample and the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) revealed that V. atypica KON, V. atypica KON ATCC 17744, and V. atypica NCTC11830 are the same strain and the result of the phylogenetic tree of 16S rRNA showed that these three strains are in the same cluster (Supplementary Figure S1), the result in Figure 1D showed that V. atypica KON, V. atypica NCTC11830, and V. atypica KON ATCC 17744 are not in a same cluster. These results suggested that V. atypica KON, V. atypica KON ATCC 17744, and V. atypica NCTC11830 are different substrains of V. atypica KON. We speculated that the genetic variations of these three substrains contributed to their remarkable differences. For example, the number of 16S rRNA gene copies of these substrains ranged from 1 to 4. One 16S rRNA gene copy was presented in V. atypica KON, four 16S rRNA gene copies were presented in V. atypica KON ATCC 17744, and three 16S rRNA gene copies were presented in V. atypica NCTC11830. The results of the similarity analysis among the genomes of V. atypica KON, V. atypica NCTC11830, and V. atypica KON ATCC 17744 showed that the symmetric identity between V. atypica KON ATCC 17744 and V. atypica KON is 98.91%, while the symmetric identity between V. atypica KON ATCC 17744 and V. atypica NCTC11830 is 97.51%. In these two trees, V. atypica KHUD_V1 showed a closer evolutionary relationship with V. atypica AF36-15BH than with the other strains, although these two strains were isolated from different sources (oral cavity and feces). A previous study reported that V. atypica OK5 was isolated from a human saliva sample and the first transformable strain in Veillonella genus (Zhou et al., 2017). Another study sequenced the complete genome and successfully established a counter-selectable markerless mutagenesis system for the strain V. atypica OK5; these advances made the strain V. atypica OK5 an important and preferred strain in genetic studies of Veillonella genus (Zhou et al., 2015). However, the two different phylogenetic trees in the present study revealed that the evolutionary relationship of V. atypica OK5 was farther than previously thought from that of the remaining eight V. atypica strains (Figures 1C,D). This result suggested that V. atypica OK5 may not be a suitable representative strain of V. atypica. Hence, additional strains should be re-selected for sequencing and model construction to facilitate future studies on Veillonella genus. Additionally, although V. atypica NCTC11830, V. atypica KON, V. atypica KON ATCC 17744, V. atypica ACS-049-V-Sch6, V. atypica ACS-134-V-Col7a, and V. atypica CMW7756B showed closer phylogenetic relationships with one another, their evolutionary relationships remained intricate (Figures 1C,D). This observation suggested that these strains were dissimilar. Moreover, these strains contained more accessory families than V. atypica KHUD_V1, V. atypica AF36-15BH, and V. atypica OK5, with the exception of V. atypica ACS-049-V-Sch6. Furthermore, the numbers of accessory families of these six strains were diverse. Hence, we speculated that the gain and the loss of different genes from different strains contributed to the large differences in the genetic compositions of V. atypica strains and led to evolutionary divergence among V. atypica strains. Previous studies have reported that the members of Veillonella are generally unable to ferment carbohydrates but rather grow well on media containing lactate, pyruvate, malate, or fumarate under anaerobic conditions (Kolenbrander, 2006). The members of Veillonella have been suggested to exhibit unusual metabolism of carbohydrates, but this type of metabolism has not been clarified in the V. atypica strains. Hence, in the present study, 2,065 homologous clusters of V. atypica were systemically identified against the CAZy database to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic ability of carbohydrate of V. atypica (Yin et al., 2012). A total of 43 orthologous genes were identified and grouped into 23 CAZyme families (Figure 2A). Among these 43 orthologous genes, 29 and 14 orthologous genes belonged to accessory clusters and core clusters and categorized into 11 and 18 CAZyme families (Figures 2B,C), respectively. The number in Figure 2 represents the number of genes classified into each CAZyme family for each V. atypica strain and shows the distribution of CAZyme families in the nine V. atypica strains. It was also noted that the 14 orthologous genes belonging to the core clusters all belonged to the single-copy gene clusters and the distribution of CAZyme derived from the core clusters are same in the V. atypica strains (Figure 2B). We observed that the CAZymes derived from the core clusters were mainly divided into glycosyltransferase (GT), glycoside hydrolase (GH), and carbohydrate esterase (CE). Previous studies have reported that the primary function of GTs is to catalyze glycoside synthesis, the substrates of which are various sugar-1-phosphate derivatives (Lairson et al., 2008). During the process of reaction, GT utilizes activated sugar donors and catalyzes glycosyl group transfer to appropriate acceptors (Martinez-Fleites et al., 2006). In the present study, eight kinds of GTs derived from the core clusters were found in the nine V. atypica strains, namely, GT19, GT2, GT30, GT4, GT45, GT51, GT83, and GT9 (Figure 2B). Among these GT families, GT2 and GT4 families are comprised of chitin synthase, cellulose synthase, \u03b1-glucosyltransferase, etc. (Bohra et al., 2019), and GT4 is one of the largest families and contains several enzymes that contribute to lipopolysaccharide synthesis and antibiotic avilamycin A synthesis (Martinez-Fleites et al., 2006). GT9 and GT19 are heptosyltransferase (lipopolysaccharide N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase) and lipid-A-disaccharide synthase, respectively, and they contribute to the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide (Qi et al., 2019). In the present study, the numbers of GT2, GT4, GT9, and GT19 were pre-dominant in the nine V. atypica strains. Owing to the presence of CAZyme families, V. atypica has an unusual preference for organic acid carbon sources and plays a crucial role in the removal of toxic metabolites from biofilm communities (Delwiche et al., 1985; Knapp et al., 2017). Distribution of CAZymes in the nine Veillonella atypica strains. (A) Distribution of CAZymes of pan-genome in each V. atypica strain. (B) Distribution of CAZymes of pan-genome in each V. atypica strain grouped by core clusters. (C) Distribution of CAZymes of pan-genome in each V. atypica strain grouped by accessory clusters. The numbers shown in subgraphs represent the orthologous genes assigned by CAZymes. GT, glycosyltransferase; GH, glycoside hydrolase; CE, carbohydrate esterase; CBM, carbohydrate-binding molecule; AA, auxiliary activities; PL, polysaccharide lyases; SLH, S-layer homology. Additionally, the differences in CAZymes among the nine V. atypica strains were attributed to the CAZyme components derived from the accessory clusters (Figure 2C). For example, V. atypica NCTC11830, V. atypica ACS-134-V-Col7a, and V. atypica ACS-049-V-Sch6 were found to harbor one orthologous gene belonging to AA6, which is 1,4-benzoquinone reductase and involved in the biodegradation of aromatic compounds (Luo et al., 2018). V. atypica ACS-134-V-Col7a and V. atypica ACS-049-V-Sch6 harbored one orthologous gene belonging to CE14, whereas V. atypica KON, V. atypica ACS-134-V-Col7a, V. atypica ACS-049-V-Sch6, and V. atypica CMW7756B harbored one orthologous gene belonging to GT83 (Figure 2C). The distributions of CAZymes in the nine V. atypica strains were different, suggesting the remarkable differences in the ability of each V. atypica strain in carbohydrate metabolism. The pan-genome of V. atypica was profiled against COG to gain insight into the functional composition of V. atypica and characterize its functional traits for the accessory, core, and specific clusters (Figure 3A). The orthologous clusters of the pan-genome were mainly dominant in \u201cgeneral function\u201d (R, 218, 12.54%), \u201camino acid transport and metabolism\u201d (E, 186, 10.7%), and \u201ctranslation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis\u201d (J, 145, 8.34%). The functions of the accessory clusters were mainly enriched in \u201creplication, recombination, and repair\u201d (L, 50, 13.93%), \u201cgeneral function\u201d (R, 49, 13.65%), \u201cinorganic ion transport and metabolism\u201d (P, 28, 7.8%), \u201camino acid transport and metabolism\u201d (E, 23, 6.41%), \u201ctranslation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis\u201d (J, 24, 6.69%), and \u201ccoenzyme transport and metabolism\u201d (H, 22, 6.13%). The specific genes of the nine V. atypica strains are the primary contributors to the functions involved in \u201ccell wall\/membrane\/envelope biogenesis,\u201d \u201cgeneral function,\u201d and \u201ctranscription.\u201d Cluster of Orthologous Group (COG) and Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of gene families for the pan-genome of Veillonella atypica. (A) Distribution of 25 functional categories according to COG annotation for V. atypica. Distribution of GO annotation of pan-genome in (B) biological process, (C) cellular component, and (D) molecular function for V. atypica. The pink, green, and wathet blue bars of each subgraph represent the accessory, core, and specific clusters, respectively. In addition, GO analysis was performed to characterize the genetic functions of V. atypica and obtain a deep understanding of the function catalogs of this species. Based on the genetic functions of the orthologous clusters, these genes were categorized into biological process, cellular component, and molecular function (Figures 3B,D). An enrichment analysis of biological processes revealed that high proportions of the core and the accessory genes contributed to the functions involved in \u201ccellular process\u201d (442, 58.01%), \u201cmetabolic process\u201d (432, 56.69%), \u201ccellular metabolic process\u201d (396, 51.97%), \u201corganic substance metabolic process\u201d (392, 51.44%), \u201cprimary metabolic process\u201d (354, 46.46%), \u201cnitrogen compound metabolic process\u201d (350, 45.93%), \u201cbiosynthetic process\u201d (297, 38.98%), and \u201csmall molecule metabolic process\u201d (203, 26.64%) (Figure 3B). The majority of the genes assigned to cellular components was grouped into \u201ccell\u201d (600, 78.74%), \u201cintracellular\u201d (368, 48.29%), \u201cmembrane\u201d (368, 48.29%), \u201ccell periphery\u201d (356, 46.72%), and \u201cplasma membrane\u201d (324, 42.52%) (Figure 3C). An enrichment analysis of molecular function showed that many genes were grouped into the functions involved in \u201ccatalytic activity\u201d (334, 43.83%), \u201cbinding\u201d (150, 19.69%), \u201chydrolase activity\u201d (118, 15.49%), and \u201ctransferase activity\u201d (101, 13.25%) (Figure 3D). Unlike the previous studies that focused on the pan-genome of Aeromonas and Shewanella, the present study found that the distribution of the functional categories of V. atypica was different from that of Aeromonas and Shewanella. The pan-genome analysis of the Aeromonas strains showed that several COG categories had a higher percentage in the accessory clusters than in the other clusters but were less represented in the core clusters, such as \u201cenergy production and conversion,\u201d \u201camino acid transport and metabolism,\u201d \u201ccarbohydrate transport and metabolism,\u201d and \u201ctranscription\u201d (Zhong et al., 2019). By comparison, the pan-genome analysis of 24 Shewanella strains showed that the functional traits affiliated with \u201cplasma membrane\u201d had a higher percentage in the specific clusters than the other functional traits but were less represented in the core and the accessory clusters (Zhong et al., 2018). In the present study, the functional traits of the V. atypica strains had a higher percentage in the core clusters than in the accessory and the specific clusters (Figures 3B,D), suggesting that the primary genetic functions of the V. atypica strains depended on its core genome of V. atypica, while the differences between the accessory and the specific clusters contributed to the other metabolism functions of V. atypica. To obtain a deeper understanding of the metabolic pathways of the V. atypica strains, we annotated the proteins of the nine V. atypica strains against KEGG database. The outputs of the KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS) server for the nine V. atypica strains are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. The metabolic pathways detected in the nine V. atypica strains were mainly involved in primary metabolic synthesis and secondary metabolic synthesis. Firstly, a large proportion of the proteins was involved in the metabolic pathways of ribosome (4.57\u20134.8%), ABC transporters (3.78\u20134.37%), porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism (3\u20133.3%), purine metabolism (2.87\u20132.97%), pyrimidine metabolism (2.42\u20132.56%), pyruvate metabolism (2.37\u20132.53%), cysteine and methionine metabolism (2.28\u20132.41%), two-component system (2.12\u20132.56%), aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (2.24\u20132.32%), quorum sensing (2.17\u20132.4%), carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes (1.85\u20132.08%), phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis (1.7\u20131.8%), and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis (1.71\u20131.79%) (Supplementary Table S1). Notably, the number of genes detected in these pathways varied in the nine V. atypica strains, and several proteins were annotated to the KEGG pathways of antibiotic resistance, including vancomycin resistance and platinum drug resistance (Supplementary Table S1). Vancomycin resistance in genus Veillonella has already been reported (Al-Otaibi and Al-Mohizea, 2014; Carlier, 2015), but our new finding indicated that the functional information of the nine V. atypica strains was involved in the metabolic pathway of vancomycin, which is summarized in Supplementary Tables S2, S3. Our results reinforced the results of previous studies associated with vancomycin in V. atypica and provided valuable information from the perspective of bioinformatics and pan-genome, which is helpful for researchers who are interested in the V. atypica strains to conduct more in-depth research. Secondly, based on the annotations of the proteins for the nine V. atypica strains, we constructed the pathway maps and the modules for the nine V. atypica strains. These pathway maps and modules are summarized in Supplementary Tables S2, S3. Among the integrated metabolic pathways, a large proportion of the proteins was involved in metabolic pathways, ranging from 19.08 to 19.41%, for the nine V. atypica strains (Supplementary Table S2). The top pathways annotated with maximum KEGG orthology hits were biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (8.17\u20138.35%), biosynthesis of antibiotics (5.62\u20135.85%), microbial metabolism in diverse environments (4.36\u20134.5%), and biosynthesis of amino acids (4.12\u20134.27%) (Supplementary Table S2) in the nine V. atypica strains. Combined with the information provided in Supplementary Table S1, we found that the KEGG pathways were involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotics, including novobiocin biosynthesis, streptomycin biosynthesis, carbapenem biosynthesis, prodigiosin biosynthesis, acarbose and validamycin biosynthesis, penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis, biosynthesis of ansamycins, and biosynthesis of vancomycin group antibiotics. Additionally, 138 KEGG modules were identified in the nine V. atypica strains (Supplementary Table S3). The distributions of the number of genes identified in these pathways and modules were almost the same in the nine V. atypica strains. Overall, an investigation of the metabolic pathways of the nine V. atypica strains will expand our knowledge of these processes and also aid in the transformation of the metabolic pathways of several substrates. Besides that, it should be noted that the prediction of functional traits and metabolic pathways of the V. atypica strains in this present study depended on their genomes, whereas in the actual natural situation, microorganisms exist in the form of a microbial community. Following previous studies (Zhang et al., 2018; Zhong et al., 2019), to further profile and confirm the functional composition of the V. atypica strain, it is necessary to conduct a deeper analysis based on the metagenomic data and\/or (meta-)transcriptomic data of the microbial communities containing the V. atypica strains. Moreover, the functions, especially the metal reducing mechanism, of the V. atypica strains need to be verified via wet experiments in further studies. To efficiently edit the genetic elements of the metabolic pathways of V. atypica, we identified the CRISPR array and the Cas proteins of CRISPR\u2013Cas systems for the nine V. atypica strains. Firstly, the distribution patterns of the number of CRISPR arrays were different among the nine V. atypica strains (Table 2). V. atypica ACS-049-V-Sch6 harbored the lowest number of CRISRP arrays (two), whereas V. atypica ACS-134-V-Col7a harbored the highest number of CRISPR arrays (12) (Table 2). The CRISRP arrays are DNA segments captured by prokaryotic bacteria from invading viruses and suited as virus recognition keys. The CRISPR arrays consist of a number of spacers which, in a CRISPR array of a prokaryotic bacteria, are maximized for protection against viral attacks (Martynov et al., 2017). Owing to the repetitive nature of the repeating sequences, the CRISPR arrays have been proven difficult to generate. Variations in the number of CRISPR arrays among the nine V. atypica strains suggested that the ability of these nine V. atypica strains to accept foreign DNA was different. Secondly, the Cas proteins were detected in V. atypica ACS-049-V-Sch6 (two Cas proteins), V. atypica ACS-134-V-Col7a (four Cas proteins), V. atypica KON (three Cas proteins), V. atypica OK5 (one Cas protein), V. atypica KON ATCC 17744 (three Cas proteins), V. atypica KHUD V1 (three Cas proteins), and V. atypica NCTC11830 (one Cas protein) (Table 2). By contrast, the Cas proteins were not identified in V. atypica CMW7756B and V. atypica AF36-15BH, probably because the genomes of these two strains were not complete. The Cas proteins are known to use the genetic information stored in the CRISPR arrays to initiate a host immune response against mobile genetic elements that carry a homologous sequence to achieve gene editing (Westra et al., 2016). The variation in the number of cas genes among these nine V. atypica strains likely resulted from rapid evolution and extensive horizontal gene transfer (Westra et al., 2016), which revealed the variation of the CRISPR\u2013Cas system among the V. atypica strains and suggested that it is important to obtain a deeper understanding of the genetic background of the V. atypica strains to achieve gene editing effectively. Thirdly, we observed that these seven V. atypica strains almost harbored CAS-Type IIIA, and we detected CAS-Type IIA, CAS-Type IIC, and CAS-Type IIID in the V. atypica strains (Table 2). Taken together, these results suggested that various and diverse Cas proteins can be selected to edit the genetic elements of the V. atypica strains.

The results demonstrated that V. atypica exhibited an open pan-genome structure. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that V. atypica OK5 may not be the suitable representative strain for V. atypica. Moreover, the results suggested that another strain or additional strains are needed to be selected for sequencing and model construction for Veillonella genus in future studies. The functional annotations of the nine V. atypica strains were profiled against the CAZyme, COG, and GO databases. Our results demonstrated that the differences in CAZymes among the nine V. atypica strains were attributed to the CAZyme component derived from the accessory clusters. Additionally, the core clusters were more highly represented in the COG and the GO annotations than the accessory clusters and the specific clusters, suggesting that the primary genetic functions of the V. atypica strains depend on the core genome of V. atypica. By contrast, the differences in the accessory clusters and the specific clusters contributed to the other metabolism functions of V. atypica. Moreover, several proteins were annotated to the KEGG pathways involved in antibiotic resistance and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, demonstrating that the V. atypica strains harbored vancomycin resistance. Besides that, four main Cas proteins of the CRISPR\u2013Cas systems for the V. atypica strains, namely, CAS-Type IIIA, CAS-Type IIA, CAS-Type IIC, and CAS-Type IIID, were harbored in the V. atypica strains. These various Cas proteins can be used to edit the genetic elements of the V. atypica strains. The genetic diversity and the functional traits of V. atypica strains were together uncovered using their genomic information in this present study. The present study found considerable differences among the V. atypica strains. Hence, the results suggested that we should have a deep understanding of the genetic background of the V. atypica strains before we realize their biological potential, including their probiotic potential for humans, clarification of the metabolic pathways associated with secondary metabolic synthesis, and potential application as selenium-respiring bacterium with an important role in the selenium cycle. Nevertheless, our pilot comparative study was on the basis of one complete genome (V. atypica OK5) and eight draft genomes (the others) of the V. atypica strains, and the limitations of the genetic datasets might have possibly affected the revelation of the real comparative analysis results of V. atypica, which suggests and requires researchers to isolate more V. atypica strains from more ecological niches, especially the V. atypica strains isolated from the gut, in future studies. Additional isolated V. atypica strains and their corresponding complete genomes should be used in the comparative analysis of V. atypica, and more attention should be paid to investigate the pan-genome analysis of V. atypica to optimize the potential applications of this bacterium in future studies. It is important to note that our study is a pilot study, and we focused on the genetic diversity and the functional characteristics of the V. atypica strains. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the genetic diversity, functional composition, and metabolic pathways of the V. atypica strains and profiles their CRISPR\u2013Cas systems on the basis of the genomic information of the V. atypica strains. The results provide insights into the biosynthetic engineering of V. atypica."}]}]},{"species":"Veillonella dispar","docs":[{"title":"Prosthetic joint infection due to Veillonella dispar","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Veillonella dispar cause?","id":"234-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"joint infection","answer_start":55,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Described here is the first report of a monomicrobial joint infection caused by Veillonella dispar that resulted in loosening of a prosthesis.

They are commonly described as contaminants with limited pathogenicity and are usually associated with polymicrobial infections. Among species of the genus Veillonella that have been isolated in human infections, V. parvula is the most frequently implicated; however, it is uncommon as a cause of bloodstream infections [[8], [9], [10]], although these have been associated with non-identified species of Veillonella [11,12]. Another species, V. dispar, was isolated in pure culture from a patient with prosthetic valve endocarditis and from another with prosthetic joint infection [13,14]. To date, only one case of bloodstream infection by V. dispar has been described in the literature, and the method used to confirm the species identification was not reported [15]. Hence, to our best knowledge, we present the second case of bacteremia due to this anaerobic microorganism isolated in pure culture. The possible sources of infection with this anaerobe are not well known, although Veillonella is often implicated in periodontal disease. The present patient had no history of periodontal disease and showed only an abdominal focus of the infection, with diarrhea and vomiting. The most likely source of infection was therefore the gut, taking into account that Veillonella spp. form part of the normal microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract. MALDI-TOF MS offers a rapid approach for the routine analysis of bacteria in clinical laboratories. It can be highly useful for the final identification at both genus and species level and may help to detect new species of anaerobes. Nevertheless, this technique should be applied with care, evaluating the version of the database used, the log score obtained, and the consistency of the identification. When the log score indicates high confidence but the consistency is low (as in the present case), molecular methods should be used to confirm the result and avoid misidentification. Most in vitro studies suggest that Veillonella spp. remain susceptible to a wide range of commonly used drugs. Among case reports, several did not perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing [8,10,15] and three found that Veillonella isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested, although there was a high heterogeneity [11,13,14]. High resistance to metronidazole (MIC > 128 mg\/L) was described in one report [9] and resistance to penicillin and metronidazole in another 12], whereas metronidazole was found to be active against 100% of Veillonella isolates in another study [16]. A study of 83 isolates of Veillonella (52 isolates of V. parvula) showed resistance to penicillin in 59% and resistance to clindamycin in 7% of them. In the present study, no resistance to metronidazole or imipenem was detected [17]. In a very recent study of Veillonella isolates (n = 17) in Greece [18], 29.4% were resistant to penicillin and 35.3% to ampicillin, with a beta-lactamase production rate of 29.4%, and 17.6% were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam, 11.8% to clindamycin, and 5.9% to moxifloxacin; no resistance to metronidazole was observed. However, a study in Taiwan found that 20% of Veillonella spp. isolates were resistant to metronidazole [19]. In the present case, the strain was resistant to penicillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole. Taken together, the above findings indicate an increased resistance of Veillonella spp. to penicillin, clindamycin, and piperacillin-tazobactam. Overall, the resistance of Veillonella spp. to metronidazole remains low, although some resistant strains have been reported in different countries. Susceptibility testing of these strains is essential to develop the optimal therapeutic strategy against these infections. In conclusion, this is the second report of V. dispar isolated in pure culture and confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as a cause of bacteremia, indicating that this pathogen can be responsible for severe infections. This case report and recent observations of antimicrobial susceptibility among Veillonella spp. highlight an increased resistance to various antimicrobials and emphasize the need for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of all isolates."}]}]},{"species":"Salmonella Typhimurium","docs":[{"title":"Intracontinental spread of human invasive Salmonella Typhimurium pathovariants in sub-Saharan Africa","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Salmonella Typhimurium cause?","id":"235-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease","answer_start":27,"id":1},{"text":"iNTS disease","answer_start":934,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" A highly invasive form of non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease has recently been documented in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

These difficulties are compounded by methodological problems in in vitro susceptibility testing for which there are, as yet, no formal guidelines.

The spectrum of clinical syndromes associated with S. maltophilia infection continues to expand. Despite this, little is known about virulence factors associated with the bacterium. In addition, there is still considerable uncertainty about the route(s) of acquisition of S. maltophilia. Although a number of sources in the hospital environment have been identified, strains isolated from these sites often differ from those obtained from clinical material. In addition, evidence from a small number of reported outbreaks indicates that person-to-person transmission may be an infrequent occurrence in the nosocomial setting. The majority of strains of S. maltophilia are characterized by their resistance to many currently available broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, including those of the carbapenem class. Although resistance to drugs of the \u03b2-lactam class has been extensively investigated, mechanisms which confer resistance to other agents have received comparatively little attention. Current methods of in vitro susceptibility testing manifest significant variations in observed results hampering the selection of optimal therapy for S. maltophilia-associated infection. Moreover, in vitro susceptibility data frequently do not correlate with a successful clinical outcome. Management of infection is sometimes further complicated by the emergence of mutants exhibiting pleiotropic resistance.

The emergence of new multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) organisms (MDROs) found in nonclinical environments, the increasing reports of community-acquired infections, and the spread of these pathogens in the clinical setting have all underscored the need to monitor these organisms. The increase in reported cases of MDRO-associated infections has resulted in efforts to examine possible sources of these pathogens, assess the current antimicrobial strategies used for the treatment of infections, and elucidate the molecular mechanisms used by these pathogens during infection and disease. Gram-negative bacterial pathogens have received much attention, as they are often MDROs due to multidrug resistance pumps, plasmids harboring antibiotic resistance genes, and various gene transfer mechanisms involved in the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an example of such an MDRO that causes respiratory infections in patients, particularly those with cystic fibrosis (CF) or those with chronic lung diseases. P. aeruginosa has been reported to survive for months on dry surfaces (180), and it is able to persist and grow in contaminated antimicrobial hand soap containing triclosan, making it a significant issue of concern for hospital staff (192). Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an environmental global emerging Gram-negative MDRO that is most commonly associated with respiratory infections in humans. It can cause various serious infections in humans.

The development of new treatments needs to take a microbial ecology\/community approach to consider the interaction of S. maltophilia with host cell surfaces and antimicrobial defenses presented by the host and evaluate any effect on other potential pathogens colocalized with S. maltophilia. The use of biocides in clinical\/medical settings should be carefully controlled to avoid encouraging the spread of biocide-tolerant S. maltophilia strains (e.g., those carrying the qac gene cassette). An increase in the number of immunosuppressed individuals in the global population due to HIV infection, chemotherapy, drug therapies, and genetic disorders has been predicted (253). This anticipated increase underscores the need to continue to monitor worldwide the drug resistance status of emerging opportunistic pathogens such as S. maltophilia and identify genetic transfers that are occurring between different bacterial species. These studies may give insights into novel molecular and cellular targets that, when disrupted, result in decreased cooperation between different species and help reduce the incidence of particular polymicrobial infections, such as those found in CF or cancer patients. The identification of novel genetic mechanisms that enable the persistence of opportunistic bacterial pathogens in the community and clinical environments will likely lead to new strategies aimed at weakening or eliminating the survival of these organisms. To combat the increasing incidence of S. maltophilia infections in hospitals and clinics, education to increase awareness of health care personnel is a key step in preventing the transmission and spread of this opportunistic pathogen. The prevention of biofilm formation and a reduction of the risk of infection within the clinical setting necessitate an observation of aqueous-associated environments and regular cleaning and disinfection regimens for surfaces of medical equipment that comes into contact, directly or indirectly, with patients. The hygienic practice of hand washing by health care personnel must continually be reinforced to reduce the possibility of organism transfer from tap water to patients. The avoidance of the use of hospital tap water for bathing and cleaning of wounds is a necessary measure of care for particularly vulnerable populations such as neonatal patients. The discarding of residual antibiotic solutions, residual and possibly contaminated hand soap solutions, and patient body fluids into the hospital plumbing system should be avoided. An increased vigilance for the observation and replacement of worn parts of susceptible surfaces, such as old deteriorating plumbing systems, can help reduce the risk of infection. Steps taken such as these are actions that can help lower the number of fatalities associated with S. maltophilia infections."}]}]},{"species":"Streptococcus parasanguinis","docs":[{"title":"Identification of critical residues in Gap3 of Streptococcus parasanguinis involved in Fap1 glycosylation, fimbrial formation and in vitro adhesion","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Streptococcus parasanguinis normally exist?","id":"237-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"human tooth surfaces","answer_start":54,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Streptococcus parasanguinis cause?","id":"237-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"dental plaque formation","answer_start":106,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Streptococcus parasanguinis is a primary colonizer of human tooth surfaces and plays an important role in dental plaque formation. Bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation are mediated by long peritrichous fimbriae that are composed of a 200 kDa serine rich glycoprotein named Fap1 (fimbriae-associated protein). Glycosylation and biogenesis of Fap1 are modulated by a gene cluster downstream of the fap1 locus. A gene encoding a glycosylation-associated protein, Gap3, was found to be important for Fap1 glycosylation, long fimbrial formation and Fap1-mediated biofilm formation. Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis were employed to dissect the regions within Gap3 that were important for its function in Fap1 glycosylation and biogenesis. A deletion of 6 consecutive amino acids, PDLPIL, eliminated the production of the mature 200 kDa Fap1 protein and gave rise instead to a 470 kDa Fap1 intermediate that was only partially glycosylated. Site-directed mutagenesis of the 6 amino acids revealed that only three of these amino acids were required. Mutants in these amino acids (L64R, P65R and L67T) produced the premature 470 kDa Fap1 intermediate. Mutants in the remaining amino acids produced the mature form of Fap1. Cell surface expression of the Fap1 precursor among L64R, P65R and L67T mutants was reduced to levels consistent with that of a gap3 insertional mutant. Electron micrographs showed that these 3 mutants lost their long peritrichous fimbriae. Furthermore, their in vitro adhesion ability to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite (SHA) was inhibited.

The accumulation of oral microorganisms on the tooth surfaces leads to the development of a structured microbial community known as dental plaque, one of the most common human biofilms [3-5]. The adhesion of S. parasanguinis FW213 to an in vitro tooth model is mediated by its long, peritrichous fimbriae [6,7]. A fimbriae-associated adhesin, Fap1, is the major subunit of the long fimbriae [8]. Fap1, a serine-rich glycoprotein, is required for biofilm formation and bacterial adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite (SHA, an in vitro tooth model [8,9]). A fap1 genomic island has been identified in the S. parasanguinis FW213 genome. This island consists of seven genes, secY2, gap1 to gap3, secA2, gtf1, and gtf2 and has been shown to play an important role in Fap1 glycosylation and biogenesis [10,11]. Moreover, gene clusters similar to the fap1 locus have been identified in other Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae [12-17]. The findings that the fap1-like loci are widespread among Gram-positive bacteria suggest that there is a common mechanism in the biogenesis of serine-rich glycoproteins.

It is a prevalent bacteria in the oral cavity of both adults and infants (Franzosa et al., 2014; Dzidic et al., 2018), and plays an important role in dental plaque formation (Garnett et al., 2012) and significantly inhibits the growth the periodontopathogens by producing hydrogen peroxide (Herrero et al., 2016). The abundance of oral S. parasanguinis is associated with childhood allergies (Dzidic et al., 2018) and caries (Becker et al., 2002). S. parasanguinis is also frequently isolated from the breast milk of women (Lara-Villoslada et al., 2007), and our human breast milk microbiota-associated mouse model showed that breast milk S. parasanguinis can colonize gut (Wang et al., 2017). Indeed, S. parasanguinis is one of the dominating pioneer colonizers of human infant intestine in first days of life (Songjinda et al., 2005), a predominant bacterial species in the small intestine of adults (van den Bogert et al., 2013b), and also detected in the feces of children (Zhang et al., 2015) and adults (Franzosa et al., 2014). In vitro experiments showed one human small intestinal S. parasanguinis strain moderately activated NF-\u03baB via TLR2\/6 signaling, and thus induced the maturation, activation and cytokine IL12 secretion of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (van den Bogert et al., 2014). Occasionally, S. parasanguinis can translocate to the bloodstream and result in infective endocarditis (Naveen Kumar et al., 2014). Therefore, it is necessary to develop molecular methods to quantify and profile S. parasanguinis in human microbiome samples to understand its role in human health and diseases. 16S rRNA gene is often used to identify bacteria at the species level, but the interspecies divergence of Streptococcus 16S rRNA gene as low as 0.3% does not allow the effective discrimination of closely related Streptococci (Glazunova et al., 2009). Van den Bogert et al. (2013a) identified unique genes that are solely present in the genome of one S. parasanguinis strain isolated from the ileostoma effluent of one healthy Ileostomist, and designed specific PCR primers for the strain, but the primers cannot detect S. parasanguinis strains colonizing other human subjects. Park and Kook (2013) developed S. parasanguinis-specific PCR primers based on the genomic DNA sequences with unknown function, however, it is unknown whether the unannotated genomic sequences are present in all strains of S. parasanguinis. The housekeeping groEL gene is ubiquitously distributed among bacteria. It encodes chaperonin GroEL (synonyms are Cpn60 and Hsp60) that assists proper protein folding in bacterial cells. The groEL gene sequences are widely used to study the phylogeny of bacteria (Viale et al., 1994) including Streptococcus spp. (Teng et al., 2002; Glazunova et al., 2009; Lourenco et al., 2017; Leigh et al., 2018). In addition, groEL gene shows 3.4% divergence among different Streptococcus species, and thus has much higher power than 16S rRNA gene in discriminating Streptococcus species (Glazunova et al., 2009). The Chaperonin Sequence Database (Junick and Blaut, 2012) currently contains \u223c22,000 groEL sequences of prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archaea, and among these sequences, 866 are from 64 Streptococcus species, and 8 are from 7 S. parasanguinis strains. This database provides good reference sequences of groEL gene for PCR primer development. In the present study, we developed two PCR primer pairs, which consist of three primers, to specifically detect human commensal S. parasanguinis. Both primer pairs were used to amplify and clone the groEL gene of human saliva S. parasanguinis, and quantify human fecal and saliva S. parasanguinis with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)."}]}]},{"species":"Streptococcus oralis","docs":[{"title":"Streptococcus Oralis meningitis from right sphenoid Meningoencephalocele and cerebrospinal fluid leak","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Streptococcus oralis normally exist?","id":"238-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"nasal and oropharynx","answer_start":101,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Streptococcus oralis cause?","id":"238-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"meningitis","answer_start":335,"id":1},{"text":"meningitis","answer_start":1388,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Streptococcus oralis belongs to the Streptococcus mitis group and is part of the normal flora of the nasal and oropharynx (Koneman et al., The Gram-positive cocci part II: streptococci, enterococci and the \u2018Streptococcus-like\u2019 bacteria.

There are case studies of Streptococcus oralis causing meningitis in individuals with decreased immune function and with anatomic manipulation of the central nervous system. These include cases caused by increased alcohol use [2], leukemia [3], spinal anesthesia [4], and neurologic surgeries [2]. Streptococcus oralis has caused meningitis in those with surgical manipulation of the dental cavity as well due to the anatomical location of the organism and propensity to cause meningitis in individuals [5, 6]. Cerebrospinal fluid leaks place patients at increased risk for meningitis. A retrospective study analyzing 111 patients with proven CSF leak from endoscopy, beta-2 transferrin, imaging, and\/or fluorescein lumbar puncture had risk of meningitis of 19% over 12 years [7].. The most common organism implicated in meningitis from cerebrospinal fluid leaks is Streptococcus pneumoniae [7].

Guidelines from Infectious Disease Society of America in diagnosing bacterial meningitis include blood cultures and computed tomography scan of the head without contrast in select populations to evaluate for any contraindications to lumbar puncture [8]. Those with contraindications and high likelihood for meningitis are treated with targeted antibiotics based on blood culture results [8].

CT scan should be performed next, and if there are contraindications to lumbar puncture and a high clinical likelihood for meningitis, antibiotics must be administered as soon as possible [8]. In this scenario, antibiotics must target the organism collected form blood cultures [8]. Magnetic resonance imaging with intravenous gadolinium and fluid attenuated inversion recovery has high sensitivity and specificity for meningitis based on meningeal enhancement [9, 10]. Streptococcus oralis has not been implicated in meningitis from cerebrospinal fluid leaks in the literature. Risks of meningitis from chronic CSF leaks over 12 years are 19% and carry a high morbidity and mortality [7]. Beta 2 transferrin is a useful adjuvant in helping clinicians diagnose CSF leaks, with a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 99% [11\u201313]. It is important for clinicians to suspect cerebrospinal fluid leak in those with altered mental status due to concern for spread of local organisms causing meningitis. Prompt antibiotics and surgical management are paramount in preventing morbidity and mortality [9]. It is important to rule out infective endocarditis because Streptococcus oralis has propensity to cause this disease burden [7].

In the literature, PD-related peritonitis caused by S. oralis is rarely reported. Therefore, little background information exists for the condition. This case report is the first to describe PD-related peritonitis caused by S. oralis with persistent systemic inflammation. Viridans group streptococci, including S. oralis, are a major cause of bloodstream infection and infectious endocarditis associated with dental caries (5,7). Cases of PD-related peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci that developed after dental interventions have been reported in the literature (8,9). In the present case, a dental examination revealed no dental lesions that might have caused systemic infection. Furthermore, no dental intervention had been performed recently. Blood cultures were negative. Moreover, a transthoracic echocardiogram showed no vegetation on the valves. Extra-oral entry of the bacteria was thus suspected to be the infection route. Of the two brief case reports concerning PD-related peritonitis caused by S. oralis, neither includes proof of oral infection (10,11). Touch contamination during bag exchanging procedures is reported as the cause in 89% of cases of PD-related peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci (1). This finding suggests that not only oral infection but also touch contamination via saliva splashes is a major infection route of PD-related peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci. One of the two earlier case reports of PD-related peritonitis caused by S. oralis describes a saxophone player who played the saxophone before each onset of consecutive episodes of PD-related peritonitis. Given that he no longer developed PD-related peritonitis after he quit playing the saxophone, the authors inferred that his saliva spreading all around himself heightened the risk of PD-related peritonitis via touch contamination (11). In our case, the patient used a sterile tubing welder, which minimizes the risk of touch contamination. One might infer the arteriovenous fistula puncture for the hemodialysis sessions as the cause of undetected transient bacteremia of S. oralis if his limbs had been contaminated with someone's saliva. Although this was a possible route of entry, the patient and staff were wearing face masks, the puncture sites were cleansed with chlorhexidine, signs of infection were absent at the puncture site, and blood cultures were negative. All such measures and findings decrease the likelihood of such an infection. To our knowledge, there have been no case reports of arteriovenous fistula infection caused by S. oralis. No other clues were available to ascertain the infection route. There was no gastrointestinal symptoms, exit-site infection, catheter-tunnel infection, or recent catheter leakage. Although the infection route was not identified, the details of this case emphasize the value of considering extra-oral infection routes even if the causative bacteria are part of the oral flora. In the short term, PD-related peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci has favorable outcomes. In fact, PD-related peritonitis overall is complicated by relapse within 4 weeks in 14% of all cases, by catheter removal in 22%, and by death in 2-6% (12), whereas previous reports have found that PD-related peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci was complicated by its relapse within 4 weeks in only 0-2% of cases and catheter removal in only 6%, with no deaths related to index peritonitis noted (1,3). Two earlier reported cases of PD-related peritonitis caused by S. oralis were cured merely by the administration of antibiotics (10,11). The peritonitis of the case reported here was also cured using antibiotics alone. The prognosis of PD-related peritonitis caused by S. oralis is apparently just as favorable as the prognosis of infections caused by other viridans group streptococci. In the case presented in this report, the white-cell count in PD effluent decreased to less than 100 \/\u03bcL shortly after starting the intraperitoneal administration of cefazolin and ceftazidime. Nevertheless, systemic inflammation disappeared only after the antibiotic administration route was switched from intraperitoneal administration to intravenous administration. Although the etiology underlying the systemic inflammation remains unclear, several hypotheses exist as possible explanations of the clinical course. First, the existence of a different focus of infection other than peritonitis might have caused persistent inflammation. Bacteremia was inferred as a possible complication because viridans group streptococci are a major cause of bloodstream infections. However, two sets of blood cultures were negative. The sensitivity of two sets of blood cultures for detecting streptococci bacteremia is 85% (13). No physical, laboratory or radiological findings suggest the existence of concomitant infectious diseases, including infectious endocarditis. No other focus of infection was detected throughout the clinical course. Second, residual infection of the peritoneum might have existed and might have required intravenous antibiotic administration to achieve a cure. Although the white-cell count in the PD effluent decreased to below 100 \/\u03bcL after the intraperitoneal administration of the antibiotics, 100 \/\u03bcL is the lower limit of detection and report in the PD effluent test procedure in our laboratory. Therefore, the test results might have been insufficient to reflect a low level of inflammation in the peritoneum. Conversely, previous reports suggest that the intravenous administration of antibiotics is not clinically or pharmacokinetically superior to the intraperitoneal administration for treating PD-related peritonitis with no other focus of infection (14,15). Third, simply a longer period of antibiotic therapy might have been necessary to cure the peritonitis, irrespective of the administration route used for the antibiotics. By its nature, this hypothesis cannot be verified. The International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis recommendations on peritonitis state that effective antibiotic treatment for two weeks is generally sufficient to treat PD-related peritonitis caused by streptococci (4). One might speculate that two weeks of intraperitoneal administration of antibiotics could have treated the peritonitis of this case successfully. However, one week of a persistent fever is rarely seen in PD-related peritonitis with a fair treatment response. In addition, the resolution of a fever and systemic inflammation immediately after switching the antibiotic administration route does not favor this speculation. Despite these previous investigations and discussions, the etiology of systemic inflammation that has been cured solely after the intravenous administration of antibiotics remains unclear. Although PD-related peritonitis caused by viridans group streptococci shows favorable outcomes in the short term, as many as 41% of patients experience refractory peritonitis in the long term, defined by unclear effluent after 5 days of appropriate antibiotic treatment and eventual Tenckhoff catheter removal (1). This rate is markedly higher than those of refractory peritonitis caused by other GPC (1). A review of the two earlier case reports of PD-related peritonitis caused by S. oralis revealed mixed findings: the first case report did not mention the long-term outcomes of the case (10), and the second case report described a second episode of peritonitis occurring several months after the initial one (11). Our patient has remained free from peritonitis recurrence for over nine months at the time of manuscript submission. Further follow-up can be expected to reveal long-term outcomes. This report describes a case of PD-related peritonitis caused by S. oralis via extra-oral entry complicated with persistent systemic inflammation. Few reports have described cases of PD-related peritonitis caused by S. oralis because of its rarity. Further research is warranted to elucidate more aspects of its clinical characteristics, optimum treatment, and prognosis."}]},{"title":"Streptococcus oralis endocarditis leading to central nervous system infection in pregnancy","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Streptococcus oralis is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"238-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram positive","answer_start":404,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Streptococcus oralis cause?","id":"238-3-1-2","answers":[{"text":"endocarditis subsequently led to central nervous system infection","answer_start":101,"id":1},{"text":"meningitis","answer_start":726,"id":2},{"text":"Bacterial endocarditis","answer_start":899,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Streptococcus oralis?","id":"238-3-1-3","answers":[{"text":"cocci","answer_start":418,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" This report describes a challenging obstetric case in which septic emboli from Streptococcus oralis endocarditis subsequently led to central nervous system infection.

Among these, six isolates lacked capsules, were insoluble in 10 per cent bile, showed resistance to optochin (zone size <14 mm diameter when incubated in 5% CO2) but were susceptible to optochin (zone sizes between 18 to 25 mm diameter) when incubated in ambient air. Hence, these six isolates were presumptively identified as S. pseudopneumoniae biochemically. S. pseudopneumoniae colonies grown on 5 per cent sheep blood agar were typically small (up to 1 mm in diameter after 24 h of incubation), smooth, shiny, and domed, with entire edges. Occasional colonies had depressed centers, appearing as a smaller version of the draftsmen colonies of S. pneumoniae. The remaining 19 \u03b1-haemolytic Streptococci were identified as S. pneumoniae due to the presence of capsule, bile soluble and sensitive to optochin at 5 per cent CO2 and generally poor growth or no growth in ambient air. The colonies had depressed centers typical of S. pneumoniae. Remaining 125 samples, showed heavy growth of various pathogens like Moraxella catarrhalis (n=21), Klebsiella spp. (n=8), Enterococcus spp. (n=6), Pseudomonas spp. (n=5), Haemophilus influenzae (n=6), Staphylococcus aureus (n=4) and Candida albicans (n=10). Some of the samples (n=35) also showed scanty growth of other Streptococcus spp. (Streptococci which were biochemically neither S. pneumoniae nor S. pseudopneumoniae) and mixed scanty growth of oropharyngeal flora (n=30). All six S. pseudopneumoniae isolates, were sensitive to teicoplanin, vancomycin, cefotaxime, meropenem, cefepime and showed resistance to erythromycin. S. pseudopneumoniae isolates sensitive to ciprofloxacin and tetracycline were found to be four and three, respectively. Resistance to penicillin (as determined by oxacillin screening test) and co-trimoxazole was 66 per cent. All S. pneumoniae isolates were sensitive to teicoplanin (Table). Antibiotic susceptibility pattern of S. pseudopneumoniae and S. pneumoniae Our findings indicated the presence of S. pseudopneumoniae in this region which could be isolated from a small proportion of sputum samples. All six isolates of S. pseudopneumoniae were the predominant or only microorganism from good-quality purulent sputum samples obtained from patients with symptomatic LRTI and not from URTI. Further, in all six cases, the sputum Gram stain results indicated the presence of Gram positive cocci in pairs as the predominant bacteria along with pus cells. These findings provide supporting evidence of a potential pathogenic role of S. pseudopneumoniae. All six S. pseudopneumoniae isolates were found to be resistant to erythromycin, four were resistant to penicillin (by oxacillin screening test) and co-trimoxazole, three were resistant to tetracycline and two to ciprofloxacin. Our findings corroborated with those reported from New Zealand and North America. We could not find any reported cases of isolation of S. pseudopneumoniae from India to compare our results. However, antibiotic resistance in these isolates needs to be confirmed by detecting the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the resistant isolates. High prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in major respiratory pathogens has led to serious concern in the selection of an appropriate antimicrobial agent for the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections worldwide. Increasing penicillin and multidrug resistance in S. pneumoniae has important clinical implications. In the present study, resistance to penicillin as determined by oxacillin screening test was found to be 31 per cent and that of tetracycline and co-trimoxazole were found to range from 42 to 47 per cent for S. pneumoniae. These results are in agreement with the previous findings. However, resistance to erythromycin and ciprofloxacin was also found. Currently, most clinical laboratories depend only on the optochin susceptibility test by incubation in 5 per cent CO2 for identification of S. pneumoniae. If the clinical sample has S. pseudopneumoniae it will show resistance to optochin when incubated only in 5 per cent CO2 and such isolates are likely to be reported as oropharyngeal flora. Though S. pseudopneumoniae have been isolated in this region from sputum samples of patients with LRTI, further studies are necessary to prove the potential pathogenic role of these bacteria in lower respiratory tract infection or in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Since the presumptive identification of S. pseudopneumoniae was done by biochemical reaction, further characterization of these isolates by molecular methods is necessary. Testing of large number of samples, increased awareness to look for the presence of S. pseudopneumoniae and characterization to the genetic level will help to better determine its prevalence and clinical importance. Preliminary data from this study should prompt further research to characterize the role of S. pseudopneumoniae in COPD and LRTI."}]},{"title":"Late-onset bleb-related endophthalmitis caused by Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can S. pseudopneumoniae cause?","id":"241-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"late-onset bleb-related endophthalmitis","answer_start":695,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" We report our findings in a 63-year-old male who developed late-onset bleb-related endophthalmitis.

The identification of S. constellatus is sometimes difficult because of the prolonged anaerobic culture environment [8]. During the recent decades, faster and more convenient technical methods have been applied to investigate the pathogens of infectious diseases. For example, real-time PCR assays targeting the cpn60 and 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) genes were used to detect SAG [1, 8]. Most of the S. constellatus (96%), S. intermedius (94%), and S. anginosus (60%) strains were correctly identified by targeting cpn60 [1]. 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) sequencing of purulent fluid obtained from a muscle abscess aspirate was successfully used to diagnose pyomyositis caused by SAG [8]. Rapid diagnostic kits [9] and matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) [10] were also used in clinical laboratories to identify SAG. In recent years, the application of NGS shed light on detecting pathogens more efficiently. NGS can sequence thousands to billions of DNA fragments simultaneously, making quick identification of the pathogens in culture-negative specimens possible [11]. Compared with 16S rRNA sequencing, which identifies one organism at a time, NGS can provide information on multiple organisms simultaneously [12]. Although NGS has its own drawbacks such as shorter read length and decreased raw accuracy in copy number variants (CNVs) or other structural variants, the development of culture independent NGS technology still offers unbiased, rapid etiology diagnosis for the entire microbial community [13]. In this case, S. constellatus was detected by NGS rather than traditional bacterial culture, and various reasons could contribute to this matter. Frist, S. constellatus is a facultative anaerobic organism sometimes difficult to culture, especially when not specifically requested. Secondly, the patient started with antibiotics before his admission to our hospital. It may reduce culture-dependent bacterial detection. Compared to the difficulty of traditional culture, NGS was able to amplify and detect cell-free DNA and DNA fragments in dead cells, making etiology diagnosis possible. NGS should be considered in the following occasions: pathogens not detected in clinical specimens; patient already receives antibiotics; and suspicious of uncommon pathogens. According to the literatures, among a collection of 423 clinical SAG, 1.4% of the strains were of intermediate susceptibility to penicillin and none exhibited high-level resistance to gentamicin. All the strains were susceptible to cefotaxime, vancomycin and teicoplanin [14]. Clindamycin, doxycycline, amoxicillin, and metronidazole could be used for S. constellatus infection [15, 16]. Although S. constellatus is not a commonly detected pathogen causing pleural effusion, we still need to pay attention to its pathogenicity in clinical practice. Collectively, this case reported an empyema secondary to S. constellatus infection, where NGS helped to determine the pathogen. NGS is of great significance to infection of unknown pathogens, and we expect further application of advanced sequencing technologies in infectious diseases in the future."}]},{"title":"Streptococcus constellatus Causing Empyema and Sepsis, Necessitating Early Surgical Decortication","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Streptococcus constellatus is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"242-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-positive","answer_start":58,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Streptococcus constellatus normally exist?","id":"242-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"oropharyngeal","answer_start":34,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can S. constellatus cause?","id":"242-2-1-3","answers":[{"text":"empyema and purulent abscesses","answer_start":271,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Streptococcus constellatus?","id":"242-2-1-4","answers":[{"text":"coccus","answer_start":72,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Streptococcus constellatus is an oropharyngeal commensal Gram-positive coccus, frequently associated with the respiratory tract.

The pathogenic potential of commensal bacteria such as S. constellatus should not be underestimated especially in patients with immunosuppression, making an aggressive, possibly surgical, treatment necessary. The subspecies S. constellatus is known to be a causative organism of respiratory infections, occasionally complicated by easily treatable pleural effusions or abscesses. A study by Clarridge et al. [5] found that of 41 patients with abscesses caused by S. constellatus, the majority (26\/41) had infections of the soft tissues, while only 7 cases had pleuropulmonary disease. To add to this, Noguchi et al. [8] studied a cohort of 30 patients with SMG infection, while Kobo et al. [9] studied a cohort of 236; both studies concluded that the S. constellatus subspecies was less associated with empyema and less severe infection than other SMG subspecies, such as S. intermedius. The patient in our case report, however, suffered from an aggressive S. constellatus infection, likely due to immunosuppression secondary to severe hepatic disease caused by hepatitis C, alcoholic cirrhosis, and what was later found to be hepatocellular carcinoma. Literature suggests that while S. constellatus is a known causative organism in respiratory and pleural infections, its pathogenicity is relatively less severe in comparison to its other SMG siblings. Kobo et al. [9] found interestingly that S. constellatus was associated more with bacteremia than with abscess or empyema formation. Clarridge et al. [5] reported that S. constellatus infections were sufficiently treated with simple drainage and intravenous antibiotics. Junckerstorff et al. [10] reported that patients growing S. constellatus had a shorter hospital stay and a lower 30-day mortality rate than other SMG organisms. There is one other case report by Che Rahim et al. [11] that describes a case of empyema caused by S. constellatus, for which decortication was required following a 6-week course of IV antibiotics, with improvement afterwards and no recurrence or sequelae. In contrast, a surgical intervention was necessitated in our case early on the onset of events because of clinical deterioration in a short period of time because of the liver failure. Also, in the case of our patient, even after treatment with IV antibiotics and an extensive decortication operation, he was readmitted for further issues with his chest. We believe that the likely cause of the severe clinical manifestation of a usually mild organism was due to the patient's other comorbidities, namely, decompensated liver failure and later discovered, hepatocellular carcinoma, as contributing to an overall state of immunosuppression. Initially, the plan had been to postpone the surgery until the sepsis had settled, and he was haemodynamically stable. Unfortunately, due to his deterioration, he was taken to theatre, and since the cortex was easily removable, a decision was made intraoperatively to complete an extensive decortication in favour of a simple washout and a possible return to theatre. A VATS procedure was more appropriate than open, especially due to the existing coagulation abnormalities and to the overall deteriorated condition of the patient. In conclusion, Streptococcus constellatus normally has relatively low pathogenic potential; however, in this case of an immunocompromised patient, it resulted in sepsis and required extensive decortication. Sepsis is defined as infective source confirmed or expected with 2 or more of the following criteria: temperature >38\u00b0C or <36\u00b0C, heart rate >90 beats per minute, respiratory rate >20 respirations per minute or PaCO2 <32 mmHg, and WBC >12,000\/mm\u00b3, <4,000\/mm\u00b3, or >10% bands (7). Regardless of the organism grown, it is always important to consider the potential for simultaneous comorbidities to create an immunocompromised state in patients, which may make early surgical intervention necessary."}]},{"title":"Aggressive Presentation of Streptococcus constellatus","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Streptococcus constellatus normally exist?","id":"242-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"upper respiratory, digestive, and reproductive tracts","answer_start":185,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Streptococcus constellatus cause?","id":"242-3-1-2","answers":[{"text":"pyogenic infections and ensuing abscess formations","answer_start":323,"id":1},{"text":"right middle lobe lung abscess complicated by a right hemithorax empyema","answer_start":1132,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"The Streptococcus anginosus group (SAG) consists of three bacteria (Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus anginosus) that are known commensals of the upper respiratory, digestive, and reproductive tracts.

[4] have published a short report on the pyogenic potential of different SAGs and found that S. constellatus was associated with bacteremia with no abscess or empyema formation, there have been a few reports of S. constellatus forming abscess\/empyema. Commonly identified risk factors\/conditions predisposing to infection by S. constellatus include aspiration (most common), direct implantation from trauma, surgery, extension by contiguity, and hematogenous spread [2], wherein virulence is increased in the presence of anaerobes [5]. There have been case reports of S. constellatus causing liver abscess, cerebellar abscess [6,7], and empyema (most common diagnosis in 78%) caused by the S. milleri group [2]. Risk factors for such infections include male gender, history of smoking, alcohol abuse, neoplastic disease, chronic pulmonary disease (such as COPD), periodontal disease, diabetes mellitus, hepatitis, and HIV. Risk factors in our patient include a history of hepatitis C, smoking, and a recent diagnosis of PE. Culture is the most common means of detecting bacteria. Multiplex PCR (polymerase chain reaction) has been used by Hatrongjit et al. [8] for simultaneous rapid detection of six clinically relevant Streptococcal species (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus suis, Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus anginosus\/constellatus). The process takes three hours to identify an organism and is considered a simple, reliable, and efficient method for the detection of these six streptococci. In our patient, none of the blood or sputum cultures was positive, and the organism was identified only on cultures from tissue obtained during biopsy. Clinical features of severe pneumonia were observed in our patient, which included high-grade fevers, cough with expectoration\/hemoptysis, and loss of appetite. Additional features of weight loss, such as diaphoresis, were also observed. Routine investigations to rule out differentials such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza, respiratory pathogen panel of common viruses, and community-acquired pneumonias were negative. Combination treatment modalities with antibiotics and surgery are required in most of the patients. Thoracotomy was needed in 75% of patients in one of the studies [2]. Choice and duration of antibiotics have varied in different case reports. Most patients required a long-term duration of antibiotics, with the longest being nine months with commonly used antibiotics such as penicillin\/B-lactam, carbapenem, clindamycin (most effective in severe periodontal infection) [9], ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and ciprofloxacin.

Members of this group include S. intermedius, S. anginosus, and S. constellatus [1]. They were originally grouped into one species but were later able to be separated based on their variable expression of Lancefield group antigens and hemolytic activity. However, S. intermedius is nonhemolytic and phenotypically ungroupable [2]. Although they are infrequent pathogens and are found as part of the normal flora of the oropharynx, genitourinary tract, and gastrointestinal tract [3], members of the Streptococcus anginosus group have been implicated in a variety of purulent infections and abscess formation. This includes those of the brain, meninges, heart, sinuses, liver, lungs, spleen, peritoneum, pelvis, and appendix [1, 3\u20135]. It has been suggested in some reports that infections by these bacteria are increased in patients with multiple comorbidities, malignancy, and diabetes [1]. The first cases of S. anginosus group causing hepatic abscesses were reported in 1975 [6]. A subsequent study in 1981 found this group of bacteria to be the most common cause of hepatic abscesses [7], and S. intermedius was the species most often isolated from hepatic abscesses in a prospective 1998 study [8]. Members of the S. anginosus group have frequently been isolated from dental abscesses, implicating this as one of the possible sources of many of the group's metastatic purulent infections. In a 1990 study by Whiley et al., S. intermedius was the group member most commonly found in dental plaques and in association with hepatic and brain abscesses. However, S. intermedius was not frequently associated with actual infections of the oral cavity, making a causal relationship difficult to establish [2]. A literature search was performed in order to identify cases of liver abscess due to S. intermedius in the presence of active oral infection or prior dental procedures. There are several cases of reported S. intermedius bacteremia as the causal agent of liver abscesses in the presence of active oral infection; however, none were found in the case of prior dental procedures. A 2006 case report by Wagner et al. reported on the case of brain and liver abscesses due to coexisting severe periodontal disease and bacteremia with S. intermedius being cultured from all four sources [9]. More recently, a 2009 case report by Ng and Mukhopadhyay documented a case of S. intermedius bacteremia causing liver abscess and septic shock immediately following a partial tooth extraction for a periodontal abscess [3]. Similarly, Neumayr et al. reported a case of multiple liver abscesses caused by S. intermedius in a patient with a concurrent pyogenic dental infection in a 2010 case report [4].

Direct extension from intra-abdominal infections and hematogenous spread are also possibilities [10]. The most common offending organisms are gram-negative aerobes, with Escherichia coli being the most common [11]. Dental procedures are a very rare etiology of pyogenic liver abscesses in general, with only a few cases being reported in the literature. In 1987, Tweedy and White reported a case of multiple liver abscesses due to Fusobacterium nucleatum following \u201cextensive dental work\u201d in a man with suspected primary immunodeficiency [12]. Schiff et al. (2003) also reported a case of a previously healthy woman presenting with multiple liver abscesses following a root canal filling one week prior [11], and more recently, Gungor et al. (2012) reported a case of \u201cStreptococcal subspecies\u201d causing liver abscess ten days following a dental prosthesis implantation in a patient with diabetes [13]. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pyogenic liver abscess related to S. intermedius following a routine dental cleaning. The presence of S. anginosus group bacteremia should not only alert the clinician to the possibility of underlying abscess as a source for infection. S. intermedius bacteremia and liver abscess should raise suspicion for recent history of dental manipulation in addition to active oral infection. In our case, we believe that this patient's prior dental cleaning caused bacteremia and seeding of the liver via a hematogenous route. Lack of other identifiable sources of infection and the isolation of S. intermedius from both blood and liver abscess samples support this conclusion. Given that his ERCP and cholecystectomy were more than one year prior to his presentation, it is unlikely that mucosal injury related to these procedures was linked to this presentation. In addition, his dental extraction occurred almost a year prior to presentation and is thus unlikely to have contributed. Even routine dental cleanings can predispose patients to the development of bacteremia and hepatic abscess, so detailed history taking is essential in addition to thorough examination of the oropharynx. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are imperative, as pyogenic liver abscesses are almost uniformly fatal otherwise."}]},{"title":"Streptococcus intermedius causing infective endocarditis and abscesses: a report of three cases and review of the literature","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can S. intermedius cause?","id":"245-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"abscess formation and rarely endocarditis","answer_start":133,"id":1},{"text":"hepatic abscesses, brain abscess, and endocarditis","answer_start":457,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Streptococcus intermedius is a member of the Streptococcus anginosus group.

These organisms are commonly associated with purulent infections with abscess formation and less commonly the cause of endocarditis than other viridans streptococci [9-13]. S. intermedius has an apparent tropism for the brain and liver, whereas S. anginosus and S. constellatus have been isolated from a wider range of sites and infections [2,14]. The three cases presented here highlight a common presentation of S. intermedius (liver and brain abscesses) and a rare complication (endocarditis). The identification and classification of streptococci based on hemolytic and Lancefield grouping reactions is cumbersome and lacks discriminatory power. Whiley, et. al. developed phenotypic methods to better differentiate the SAG[14]. Commercially available systems based on these phenotypic tests are widely used and provide a more rapid characterization of each species, but accuracy remains variable [15,16]. This has led to the development of molecular techniques, such as PCR sequencing, to increase the accuracy of identification and clinical profiling [1,7,17,18]. Furthermore, several species-specific genes have been targeted for the development of PCR-based assays for the identification of the SAG organisms [7,18]. Intermedilysin (ILY) is a human-specific cytolysin that directly damages human hepatic cells and is implicated as a potential important virulence factor in causing deep-seated abscesses [19]. The ily gene has been shown to be specific for S. intermedius. The assay can be used for rapid identification through the use of PCR with the ily gene as a species marker gene, which was amplified on all three isolates [7]. Pyogenic liver abscesses are an uncommon, but potentially life-threatening, infection. The first cases of SAG hepatic abscesses were reported in 1975 [20]. Later, a study in 1981 found SAG to be the most common cause of hepatic abscesses [21]. A prospective study by Coreedoira, et. al. compared the incidence and clinical features of SAG liver abscess to liver abscesses caused by other organisms. Members of SAG were most commonly isolated, with S. intermedius being the most frequent species. Abscesses also tended to be monomicrobial and the duration of symptoms were longer when compared to other organisms. However, there were no differences in mortality, duration of antibiotics, or complications. The majority of patients required surgical or percutaneous drainage of the abscesses for cure as was the case for our patients, whereas 20% of patients were treated with antimicrobials alone [22]. Members of the SAG are rare causes of endocarditis. Previous studies on infective endocarditis caused by SAG have relied on phenotypic methods for identification. Sussman, et. al. studied 36 patients with viridans streptococcal endocarditis, and identification at the species level was determined by using biochemical tests established by Facklam [23]. Four of the cases were found to be S. intermedius. Sixteen isolates from the study were sent to five institutions to confirm identification. Not surprisingly, only 3 were characterized as the same species by all five institutions [24]. Another retrospective study found 29 cases of endocarditis due to SAG, and only 3 were identified as S. intermedius [25]. However, the commercial method used in this case, Rapid 32 ID Strep System (bioM\u00e9rieux), has been shown to be the least accurate in identifying S. intermedius [16]. A more recent study by Woo, et. al. applied 16S rRNA sequencing to 6 cases of SAG endocarditis, all of which were identified as S. anginosus [3]. To our knowledge, we report the first case of S. intermedius endocarditis confirmed by 16S sequence analysis. Brain abscesses can result via spread from a contiguous focus of infection, hematogenous spread, or as a result from head trauma or neurosurgery [26]. Mortality and morbidity have reduced over the decades in the advent of newer antibiotic therapies and early recognition with CT scans and MRIs [27]. Several case series have defined the clinical characteristics of patients with brain abscesses. All ages are affected with a male predominance. Headache, fever, and mental status changes are the most common initial presenting features, although only one-third of patients have the classic triad. The majority of abscesses are solitary and occur in the frontal lobe. Surgery is required in most patients, and the duration of antibiotics range from 4 to 8 weeks [26-31]. The SAG has been recently recognized as a common cause of brain abscesses, which were collectively identified with other streptococci as viridans group streptococci in prior studies [29,31]. Several retrospective reviews and case reports have identified S. intermedius as a significant pathogen among the SAG in the development of brain abscesses [1,2,32,33]. However, no study has compared S. intermedius brain abscesses with other members of the SAG or with other bacterial causes. A unique feature of our cases was the lack of underlying medical problems in our two patients with liver abscesses. Infections caused by SAG are not common in previously healthy individuals. An underlying condition, such as diabetes, cirrhosis, or cancer, is associated with the majority of patients [12,34,35]. Neither of our patients with liver abscesses had chronic illnesses or evidence of immunosuppression. The third case with brain abscess, however, had chronic sinusitis, which is one of the most common predisposing factors [29,31]. The presentation of these cases highlights the range of infection caused by S. intermedius that can be encountered in a community setting. Our findings indicate that infections with S. intermedius and the other members of the SAG may be more common that previously appreciated."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Streptococcus intermedius cause?","id":"245-2-4-1","answers":[{"text":"liver and brain abscesses but rarely endocarditis","answer_start":31,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"S. intermedius commonly causes liver and brain abscesses but rarely endocarditis.

The oral cavity of humans is a rich environment providing a moist, warm niche for colonization by hundreds of different bacterial species that are typically harmless or beneficial to the oral health of humans. The most abundant of these bacterial species are those belonging to the genus Streptococcus. Within this environment, S. sanguinis, a primary colonizer of the tooth surface, provides benefits to the human host by protecting against the deleterious effects of another microorganism, S. mutans, the pathogen responsible for tooth decay and caries (Becker et al., 2002; Kreth et al., 2008). Oral streptococci often cause disease when the organisms move from the mouth into the human bloodstream. Of importance is infective endocarditis (IE), which is an infection of the heart valves and\/or endocardium, because the infection is associated with complications that include congestive heart failure, aneurysm and stroke (Mylonakis and Calderwood, 2001; Murdoch et al., 2009; DeSimone et al., 2015). Despite improved diagnostic and treatment options, studies continue to report that endocarditis mortality rates range from 12 to 45% (Thuny et al., 2012; Bor et al., 2013). Infective endocarditis occurs when microorganisms enter the bloodstream and colonize the cardiac endothelium. Oral streptococci are responsible for ca. 20% of the global IE burden, with greater incidence in developing and resource-limited regions (Yew and Murdoch, 2012; Vogkou et al., 2016). Among these species, S. sanguinis is particularly important as it is one of the most frequent causative agents of IE, comprising between 18 and 30% of cases (Horaud and Delbos, 1984; Douglas et al., 1993; Filippo et al., 2006). Bacteria in the oral cavity are frequent sources of transient bacteremia due to dental procedures as well as normal oral care such as brushing and mastication, which can provide oral bacteria access to the bloodstream. In addition, poor oral health can create an environment of intermittent transient bacteremia due to inflammation and\/or more severe damage oral epithelium. It is believed that an essential step in the initiation of IE is adherence of S. sanguinis to circulating platelets in the bloodstream and\/or binding to submucosal proteins such as collagen at regions of endothelial disruption or damage (Keynan and Rubinstein, 2013; Holland et al., 2016). Due to the seriousness of endocarditis and the impracticality of long-term antibiotic usage for transient bloodstream infections, understanding the virulence mechanisms of S. sanguinis is of high value. Improved understanding of the virulence factors and mechanisms of this organism will allow the development of customized therapies for treatment and prevention of bacterial endocarditis caused by S. sanguinis. Microorganisms capable of causing IE must successfully navigate several stages of disease progression and host challenges to establish a cardiac infection (Werdan et al., 2014). Principally, this involves (i) entrance to and survival within the bloodstream, (ii) adherence via host ECM components and\/or platelets at the site of valve damage, (iii) colonization of the valvular endothelium, and (iv) development of and growth within the vegetation. The need to respond to these different conditions indicate this organism has distinct mechanisms for growing and survival in the mouth and causing endocarditis in the bloodstream. Some metabolic and virulence genes involved in these processes have been characterized. The ability of this organism to form a biofilm, as part of its colonization strategy in the mouth, relies both on its ability to synthesize adhesive glucans from sucrose and to induce the release of extracellular DNA (Ge et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2018), which plays an important role in biofilm formation on the surfaces of teeth. In contrast, cardiac vegetations formed by colonization of the endothelium are expected to be composed of human platelets, fibrin and bacteria (Jung et al., 2012; Mancini et al., 2016), though glucans and extracellular DNA have also been reported to retain their importance in this environment (Jung et al., 2015, 2017). To form this specialized platelet-containing biofilm S. sanguinis must express virulence factors that function within the context of heart tissue colonization and growth. A prior investigation using signature-tagged mutagenesis evaluated 800 mutants in vivo and demonstrated significantly attenuated virulence of strains containing mutations in bacA, thrB, nrdD, and purB, which were determined to be necessary for growth and survival in different host environments (Paik et al., 2005). Similarly, mutations in the nrdHEKF genes encoding the aerobic ribonucleotide reductase system abrogated virulence in vivo by compromising its ability to grow in blood, which contains between 6 to 12% O2 (Rhodes et al., 2014). Other described virulence genes include srtA, which encodes a sortase required for anchoring proteins to the cell wall and is important for S. sanguinis adherence and colonization (Yamaguchi et al., 2006); srpA, encoding a serine-rich repeat adhesin that binds with high affinity to human platelets in whole blood and may facilitate colonization of the endocardium by \u201criding\u201d platelets to the site of damage (Plummer et al., 2005; Deng et al., 2014; Bensing et al., 2016); and nt5e, an ecto-5\u2032-nucleotidase involved in virulence and platelet aggregation which may also function as an immunosuppressant through the generation of adenosine (Fan et al., 2012). In this report, we have used a bioinformatics approach to construct a large set of S. sanguinis SK36 mutants (128 mutants) to be examined for potential involvement in the virulence mechanisms of S. sanguinis endocarditis. We have compared the phenotypes of these mutant strains to the isogenic parent S. sanguinis SK36 using in vitro virulence assays to provide a more comprehensive picture of the factors that S. sanguinis employs to cause heart infections. These experiments identified 16 new genetic loci that appear to be important in platelet interactions or adherence\/invasion interactions with host cells. We also examined the ability of two of these mutants to cause vegetations in a rabbit model that simulates left-sided, native valve endocarditis. The results obtained from these experiments are presented here in detail."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where does S. sanguinis normally exist?","id":"246-2-3-1","answers":[{"text":"oral","answer_start":1016,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can S. sanguinis cause?","id":"246-2-3-2","answers":[{"text":"IE","answer_start":1051,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Oral streptococci are significant etiological agents of IE worldwide, particularly in developing and resource-limited nations where rheumatic heart disease is a prevailing predisposing condition. Despite their historical association with the disease, virulence factors of oral streptococci contributing to the pathogenic process remain under-characterized and many putative virulence genes have not been investigated experimentally. We believe investigations directed toward addressing these limitations will ultimately engender improved clinical outcomes, especially in regions where diagnostic and treatment options are limited. For instance, vaccines to prevent infection would preempt complications from late diagnosis or inaccurate antimicrobial therapy and identify novel therapeutic targets to complement the standard antibiotic regimen (Thuny et al., 2012; Cahill et al., 2017). The goal of our present research is to identify virulence factors mediating pathogenesis of S. sanguinis, one of the most common oral Streptococcus species causing IE. We expect these investigations to facilitate further research toward the development of improved therapeutics and inform clinical management of IE. We constructed an initial pool of 128 unique mutants containing knockouts for genes predicted to encode virulence factors. These genes (Supplementary Table S1) were selected through a combination of literature surveys and computational annotation of the S. sanguinis SK36 genome available on NCBI. Most putative virulence factors identified are predicted to function in adhesion\/aggregation to host cells and cell wall metabolism. Genes predicted to function in biofilm formation, lipid, sugar, nucleic acid, and metal metabolism, redox processes, immune evasion, quorum sensing, and transcriptional regulation were also identified. Interestingly, several genes were annotated as putative toxins or associated with their function, which is generally considered absent in oral streptococci. A list of genes identified in our in vitro investigations and their known or putative function is presented in Table 1. Summary of S. sanguinis genes identified using in vitro assays. We identified four genes whose deletion resulted in decreased biofilm formation in vitro (Figure 1). Biofilm formation in this assay is expected to involve at least two bacterial factors: adherence to the microtiter surface and production of EPS. It is also possible that moderate adherence defects could be masked by massive in vitro EPS production. We therefore considered biofilm formation in this assay to be primarily indicative of EPS production and secretion. We observed that strains with the two largest reductions in biomass formation were deleted in either SSA_1515 or mur2. SSA_1515 is part of a locus encoding homologs to cell wall polysaccharides in other oral streptococci which are known to mediate intra-bacterial aggregation (Xu et al., 2007). Thus, SSA_1515 likely contributes to biofilm formation by promoting cell-cell adhesion between organisms or by serving as a trigger for EPS production. mur2, encoding a putative PG hydrolase, may influence biofilm formation through multiple mechanisms. PG hydrolases are known modulators of biofilm development in other gram-positive species where they may function to expose adhesins and mediate adherence, cell morphology, and autolytic processes for the release of extracellular DNA. Strains with mutations in two additional genes, SSA_0874 and SSA_1099, exhibited more modest biofilm defects in our assay. A predicted sulfate export transporter is encoded by SSA_0874 and potentially contributes to metabolism during biofilm growth. SSA_1099 encodes a predicted RTX-like protein of 1,477 amino acids. Repeat-in-toxin (RTX) proteins may function as cytolysins or adhesins (Linhartov\u00e1 et al., 2010) and have been exclusively characterized in gram-negative organisms. Considering S. sanguinis has not been observed to possess any hemolytic or cytolytic activities, we conclude that this protein functions as an adhesin in S. sanguinis, as our data strongly suggests. Given the large size of this protein, it is likely SSA_1099 contributes to biofilm architecture by mediating cell-to-cell interactions or multiple binding activities as has been observed for other RTX adhesins (Satchell, 2011; Dolev et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2019). Mutants deficient in binding to platelets are expected to possess reduced potential for adherence to damaged endocardium, while reduced aggregation would be expected to reduce vegetation growth and development. Consistent with these expectations, mutants in srtA or srpA \u2013 which we identify here \u2013 have been shown to be attenuated in animal models of IE (Xiong et al., 2008; Turner et al., 2009). Nine mutants from our library were determined to exhibit deficiencies in platelet binding (Figure 2), and eight of these were concomitantly reduced in platelet aggregation (Figure 3). Since prior binding to platelets is often mechanistically associated with the ability to subsequently aggregate platelets, we cannot conclude the dual phenotypes observed here are independent activities without further investigation. Two of these genes are predicted to encode proteins functioning in cell envelope metabolism, including pcsB (PG hydrolase) and murN (PG cross-linking), suggesting they function to modulate platelet interaction via adhesin accessibility and cell wall architecture. murN was unique among our platelet interactivity mutants in that it exhibited an intermediate phenotype in our platelet aggregation assay. This discrepancy suggests platelet binding and aggregation phenotypes mediated by murN are at least partially decoupled. Predicted glycosyltransferase SSA_0837 may provide essential modifications to platelet-interacting proteins. The SSA_0841 strain is the only binding mutant that exhibited an opposite phenotype for platelet aggregation. SSA_0841 in S. sanguinis possesses significant similarity to the Asp5 accessory protein in S. parasanguinis and S. gordonii where it functions in exporting the SrpA protein. Previous work in S. gordonii has indicated Asp5 shares functionality with another protein, where the absence of Asp5 results in only partial loss of SrpA surface expression (Takamatsu et al., 2005; Bandara et al., 2016). In our results with S. sanguinis, the srpA mutant is deficient for both platelet binding and aggregation in our assays (Figures 2, \u200b,3)3) while SSA_0841 is defective in platelet binding but displays wild type (WT) levels of aggregation. These results suggest the interactions mediated by surface SrpA and necessary for functional adhesion to and aggregation of human platelets are quantitatively distinct. Iron transport mediated by the lipoprotein predicted by SSA_1129 may serve to provide adequate iron levels for use as cofactors in platelet-interacting proteins. Surprisingly, the anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase, nrdD, was also identified in these assays. nrdD is required for growth under anaerobic conditions where it reduces ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides and is essential for virulence (Paik et al., 2005). While we did not observe any significant growth deficiencies under our assay conditions, it is possible subtle growth differences from the absence of the nrdD gene product have an indirect effect on proteins that interact with platelets. The largest decrease in platelet binding was observed for hlyX, which the annotation indicates encodes a hemolysin-like protein. Considering the assay that detected this mutant uses immobilized bacteria as a substrate for human platelets, it is unlikely this protein is predominantly secreted. Most likely, since no hemolytic activity is observed for S. sanguinis or oral streptococci in general, we believe this protein functions as an adhesin. SSA_1099 and its putative complex protein, SSA_1101, both exhibit substantial reductions in platelet binding and aggregation capability. Like hlyX, the results here suggest SSA_1099 is at least partly localized to the cell surface. Additionally, SSA_1101, predicted to encode a membrane fusion protein involved in the transport of SSA_1099, is also unable to bind to and aggregate platelets, indicating that the activity of this protein is likely necessary for proper localization of SSA_1099. Based on the function described here for SSA_1099 and SSA_1101, and the lack of hemolytic activity associated with oral streptococci, we propose naming these genes, and the intervening SSA_1100, platelet-binding RTX, or pbrABC. A preliminary screen for deficiencies in either adherence or invasion on HeLa cells was performed which identified 13 mutants for further investigation (Supplementary Figure S2). We subsequently identified four mutants compromised in adherence to HAECs (Figure 4A), three of which were also reduced for invasion (Figure 4B). adcC encodes a putative zinc transporter as part of an operon orthologous to one identified in S. gordonii. Components of this operon have been shown to modulate biofilm formation in both S. gordonii and S. sanguinis (Loo et al., 2003; Ge et al., 2008), suggesting zinc availability influences adhesion to host cells. A hypothetical protein predicted to be involved in inorganic ion transport is encoded by SSA_0647. While this mutant is severely compromised in adhesion, its ability to invade is only partially inhibited (compare Figures 4A,B), suggesting this protein is disproportionately involved in cell adherence. SSA_0907 encodes a putative fibronectin-binding protein present in other oral streptococci, likely mediating adhesion through direct interaction with fibronectin molecules produced by HAECs. A predicted cell wall-binding protein containing a von Willebrand factor (vWF) type A domain encoded by SSA_1063 was identified as reduced for both adhesion and invasion. Considering vWF is a common marker of endothelial cells, it is likely this protein directly binds vWF to mediate adhesion. The putative PG hydrolase mur2 could not be determined to have an adhesion phenotype distinct from WT, though it exhibited a trend toward reduced adhesion. In contrast, our invasion results indicate mur2 has no discernable deviation from WT. Infective endocarditis caused by viridans streptococci is a chronic, subacute disease commonly localized to the aortic or mitral valve and capable of development on both native and prosthetic surfaces. While the epidemiology of streptococcal IE tends to favor the native valve condition (Hill et al., 2007; Murdoch et al., 2009), most experimental systems (rabbit or rodent) have induced aortic injury via persistent (long-term) catheterization of the valve (Durack et al., 1973; Munro and Macrina, 1993; Ge et al., 2008; Das et al., 2009; Callahan et al., 2011; Fan et al., 2012; Crump et al., 2014). These models introduce a significant long-term stress to heart function as well as an abiotic surface to the cardiac environment, both of which may lead to results that vary from conditions of a native valve surface (Schlievert et al., 1998). While these published investigations are of considerable importance and data acquired using these models has provided valuable insights toward understanding mechanisms of IE caused by oral streptococci, we view these models as distinct from the native valve condition. Indeed, predisposing conditions, sequelae, and epidemiology observed in prosthetic valve IE are often distinct from native valve IE (Romano et al., 2004; Fowler et al., 2005; Murdoch et al., 2009). Rabbits infected with S. sanguinis SK36 reliably developed cardiac vegetations of considerable size compared to our mutant strains (Figures 5A\u2013D). Only one rabbit infected with a mutant strain, mur2, developed a vegetation >20 mg and contained greater than average CFU. While it was possible to quantify smaller lesions present in mutant-infected rabbits, their diminutive size and low CFUs (Figures 5D,E) made it difficult to identify with confidence whether these lesions were bacteria-induced vegetative growths or simply colonized thrombi developed from mechanical injury. Considering bacterial colonization could be demonstrated in these conditions, we conceive of vegetation sizes <10 mg as primarily indicative of thrombosis at the site of aortic injury. Using this hypothesis, our results suggest both the SSA_1099 and mur2 mutants are almost completely compromised in their ability to cause IE. However, since one rabbit infected with the mur2 mutant was observed to develop a small vegetation, this mutant may be capable of causing IE under certain conditions. Based on these data, we hypothesize SSA_1099 contributes to pathogenesis via binding to matrix proteins and\/or platelets at the site of valvular injury and via growth of the vegetative lesion, while mur2 may promote colonization and resistance to immune clearance by mediating efficient endothelial contact and development of stable \u201cbiofilm\u201d architecture. While we could reliably expect to find vegetations in rabbits infected with WT, we did observe a range a vegetation sizes observed in WT-infected rabbits. This is likely due to the outbred nature of our rabbits or inconsistencies in inducing aortic lesions. Over the course of our experiments, one rabbit infected with S. sanguinis SK36 WT developed only a minor aortic lesion and possessed no detectable CFU on the valve surface. In contrast, we were able to recover CFUs from both of our mutant strains even when vegetations were not present (Figures 5D,E), suggesting bacteremia was not successfully initiated following surgery in this rabbit. Histopathology analysis provides evidence for the formation of a fibrin-composed thrombus on the aortic valve following catheter-induced injury (Figure 7), which is consistent with the predisposing endothelial damage observed in humans (Holland et al., 2016). The presence of mineralization has also been associated with chronic valve infection in humans (Thiene and Basso, 2006) and with streptococcal IE in pigs (Jensen et al., 2010). The vegetative mass itself was composed of a fibrin meshwork heavily embedded with colonies of S. sanguinis (Figure 7G), further consistent with observations of cyclical platelet-fibrin deposition and bacterial growth during development of the vegetation (Holland et al., 2016). Interestingly, we observed the vegetations in WT-infected rabbits to exhibit marked toughness, which is consistent with thrombi having a heavy fibrin composition. In contrast, and in our experience, vegetations caused by S. aureus are generally softer and more malleable. Together, these data suggest that the rabbit model used in our infection studies is representative of native valve human IE caused by viridans group streptococci."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can S. sanguinis cause?","id":"246-2-4-1","answers":[{"text":"endocarditis","answer_start":393,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"We have identified several genes with important phenotypes in virulence-associated in vitro assays.

S. agalactiae is a rare cause of infective endocarditis causing 1.7% of all cases (2). It is a beta-hemolytic gram-positive bacteria that colonizes the female genital tract, the throat, and the rectum (3). In contrast to the incidence of S. agalactiae disease during pregnancy and the neonatal period, the incidence of invasive disease in non-pregnant adults has increased in recent years (2). This increased incidence may be related to an increase in the prevalence of underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, or to an aging population (2). A large, population-based analysis of the epidemiology of invasive S. agalactiae infection reported that almost 90% of patients had at least one underlying debilitating condition (2). The source of infection in the majority of patients with S. agalactiae endocarditis was unclear (1, 2). However, our patient displayed signs of a systemic infection a week after completion of antibiotics for the ischiorectal abscess. Although his blood cultures revealed a different pathogen from his abscess culture, his ischiorectal abscess may have been polymicrobial. Thus, we concluded that either his ischiorectal abscess or caries of the left upper molar were the primary source of infection. Mural endocarditis typically results from seeding of an abnormal area of endocardium during bacteremia or fungemia, or an extension of infection from underlying myocardial abscesses (4). However, Byung Joo Sun et al. (5) described that a large proportion of patients with infective endocarditis had no previous history of underlying heart disease: the pathophysiologic mechanism has not been clearly understood. His right-sided vegetation could not adequately explain his splenic infarction because no intracardiac shunt including patent foramen ovale was observed. Streptococcus usually facilitates two factors: plasma-clotting factor and inhibitory factor of coagulation such as streptokinase (SK) (6). Human plasma which is coagulated by the bacteria's plasma-clotting factor may become re-dissolved by their SK. The main sources of SK are beta-hemolytic streptococci of the Lancefield groups, A, C, and G, but not groups B (S. agalactiae) and F (7, 8). Therefore, the lack of SK in S. agalactiae may explain the association with large vegetations and multiple septic emboli including his splenic infarction. Well-established guidelines for treatment of valvular endocarditis point to aggressive and early surgical intervention when infection is associated with large vegetations, significant valvular or perivalvular complications, and thromboembolism. However, it is not clear whether this approach is appropriate for mural endocarditis (9).

Streptococcus suis (S. suis) that was initially reported in 1954 has been demonstrated as an etiological agent for this kind of frequently-occurring bacterial infection. Indeed, S. suis, a complex population consisting of heterogeneous strains, can be classified into 35 serotypes (1\u201334, 1\/2) based on the differentiation of capsule antigens. Based on the varied virulence of these bacteria, they may be categorized into highly-pathogenic, weakly-pathogenic (hypo-virulent), and nonpathogenic (avirulent) strains. Generally, serotype 2 of S. suis (SS2) is considered to be the most virulent, and is frequently isolated from clinically-diseased piglets. In fact, serotype 9 of S. suis is also one of the most important serotypes in several countries. Of particular note, SS2 seems to be a previously neglected but recently emerging human pathogen, whose infection has become increasingly potent, especially in the southeast Asian countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and China. As the primary agent of meningitis, septicemia, arthritis and as an opportunistic pathogen in the case of pneumonia, S. suis have been reported to have spread over 30 countries and\/or regions (Fig. 1) and has claimed no less than 1600 human cases, some of which were fatal. Also, similar clinical symptoms including bacterial meningitis, septicemia, and arthritis are frequently observed in human SS2 infections. Occasionally, serotypes other than SS2, including SS1, SS4, SS5, SS14, SS16, and SS24 can also be found to function as the causative agents responsible for sporadic cases of human S. suis infection. Of note, two big outbreaks of human SS2 endemics which occurred in China, in 1998 and 2005, respectively, have raised serious concerns in public health and have challenged the conventional opinion that human SS2 infections are only present in sporadic cases. Unfortunately, no specific\/effective human therapeutics or vaccine against SS2 infections is available thus far. Considering the severity (high mortality and modality) of SS2 infection in humans, it is important to develop a method for convenient and quick diagnosis, which can be applied toward local SS2 detection.

Over the past four decades, significant progress has been made toward better understanding the highly infectious clones of S. suis. At the time of formulating this review, 1104 articles were available in PubMed regarding S. suis (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=Streptococcus+suis).Totally, over 20 bacterial virulence-associated factors have been identified that include capsular polysaccharides (CPS), Muramidase-released protein (MRP), and Suilysin (SLY). To date, genomic sequences of a collection of S. suis strains are available (Fig. 2), the majority of which are derived from SS2 species, except two newly-released genomes which correspond to SS3 and SS14, respectively. Genomic mining combined with bacterial genetics have elucidated that Chinese epidemic strains of highly pathogenic S. suis 2 carry a specific 89K PAI (pathogenicity island). Further studies suggested that 89K PAI with a transposon-like essence can undergo GI-type T4SS-mediated horizontal transfer in epidemic SS2 species. The systematic elucidation of the of S. suis pathogenesis in the Omics Era was illustrated by functional definition of a collection of other new genes or putative orthologs (such as Zur, a zinc uptake regulator, CovR, an orphan response regulator, and Rgg-like transcription factor) following the release of the genome sequence of SS2 (e.g., 05ZYH33). Although we have gained a partial glimpse of the molecular mechanism underlying the high pathogenicity of SS2 itself, we are still lacking further insights into the interface between the SS2 pathogen and the host it infects.

Most if not all cases of Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) that have been well-documented to date were associated with the non-SS2 group A streptococcus (GAS). However, a recent large-scale outbreak of SS2 in Sichuan Province, China, appeared to be caused by more invasive deep-tissue infection with STSS, characterized by acute high fever, vascular collapse, hypotension, shock, and multiple organ failure.    Methods and findings:  We investigated this outbreak of SS2 infections in both human and pigs, which took place from July to August, 2005, through clinical observation and laboratory experiments. Clinical and pathological characterization of the human patients revealed the hallmarks of typical STSS, which to date had only been associated with GAS infection. Retrospectively, we found that this outbreak was very similar to an earlier outbreak in Jiangsu Province, China, in 1998. We isolated and analyzed 37 bacterial strains from human specimens and eight from pig specimens of the recent outbreak, as well as three human isolates and two pig isolates from the 1998 outbreak we had kept in our laboratory. The bacterial isolates were examined using light microscopy observation, pig infection experiments, multiplex-PCR assay, as well as restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) and multiple sequence alignment analyses. Multiple lines of evidence confirmed that highly virulent strains of SS2 were the causative agents of both outbreaks.    Conclusions:  We report, to our knowledge for the first time, two outbreaks of STSS caused by SS2, a non-GAS streptococcus. The 2005 outbreak was associated with 38 deaths out of 204 documented human cases; the 1998 outbreak with 14 deaths out of 25 reported human cases. Most of the fatal cases were characterized by STSS; some of them by meningitis or severe septicemia. The molecular mechanisms underlying these human STSS outbreaks in human beings remain unclear and an objective for further study.

This genus is classified as Gram-positive, cocci or spherical, and clustered pairs or chains (Figure 1) [2]. They are homofermentative and facultative anaerobes, exhibiting negative catalase activity and forming no spores [1]. Streptococci are divided into three groups based on hemolysis patterns on blood agar plates: \u03b2-hemolysis (complete hemolysis), \u03b1-hemolysis (incomplete hemolysis), and \u03b3-hemolysis (no hemolysis) [3]. Recently, phylogenetic approaches ultimately subdivided Streptococcus into eight groups consisting of mitis, sanguinis, anginosus, salivarius, pyogenic, mutans, downei, and bovis [3]. Scanning electron microscopic view of S. gordonii on a human dentin slice. S. gordonii was grown overnight in Todd Hewitt broth with 0.5% yeast extract at 37 \u00b0C and then diluted at 1:100 in the fresh medium. Human dentin slices were prepared from premolars with a single root. S. gordonii was grown on sterile dentin slices at 37 \u00b0C for 6 h. S. gordonii was visualized under a scanning electron microscope. S. gordonii exhibited spherical and clustered pairs or chains (10,000\u00d7). This experiment was performed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Dental Hospital, Seoul, Korea (CRI 17010). Streptococcus gordonii is commensal, non-pathogenic bacterium that is present in the human body, including the skin, oral cavity, upper respiratory tract, and intestine. It mainly resides on mucosal surfaces, such as the oral cavity, but also live in water, soil, plants, and food [4,5]. S. gordonii, a part of the \u03b1-hemolytic (viridans) sanguinis group, primarily inhabits the oral cavity of humans and animals [6]. However, it is also an opportunistic pathogen and can cause a variety of infectious diseases (Figure 2). Recently, metagenomic next-generation sequencing analysis showed that S. gordonii exists in patients with apical periodontitis or caries and the heart valves of patients with infective endocarditis [7,8,9]. In fact, S. gordonii, an initial colonizer on the tooth surface, can co-aggregate with several other oral microorganisms, contributing to the development of periodontal disease and caries [10]. S. gordonii can enter the blood stream by oral bleeding, leading to endocarditis [6]. Furthermore, S. gordonii binds to the cell surface of various host cells, contributing to the initiation of diseases through the inflammatory responses [11,12]. Diseases associated with S. gordonii. S. gordonii, a commensal bacterium, is found in areas of the human body, such as the oral cavity and skin. It is also an opportunistic pathogen associated with several diseases. In the oral cavity, S. gordonii is known to be closely associated with apical periodontitis. In addition, it can smear the blood stream during oral trauma and tooth extraction and disperse into various organs potentially causing systemic diseases including endocarditis, empyema, perihepatic abscesses, pyogenic spondylitis, or spondylodiscitis. The bacterial cell wall plays a crucial role in the survival and growth of bacteria [13]. In Gram-positive bacteria, the cell wall is composed of thick peptidoglycan (PGN) and various components including lipoteichoic acid (LTA), wall teichoic acid (WTA), cell wall-anchoring glycoproteins, and lipoproteins [14]. Cell wall components can be recognized by host receptors such as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which initiate host innate immune responses [14]. S. gordonii expresses cell wall proteins, including Streptococcal surface protein (Ssp) A, SspB, collagen-binding domain protein (CbdA), and serine-rich repeat (SRR) glycoproteins, such as gordonii surface protein B (GspB) and Hs antigen (Hsa) [15,16]. The cell wall proteins of S. gordonii easily adhere to platelets, erythrocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs) that could lead to acute immune responses in humans [16,17]. Therefore, understanding how cell wall components of S. gordonii interact with host cells is required not only to determine its entire pathogenesis but also to apply for the treatment and prevention of S. gordonii-mediated diseases."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Streptococcus gordonii is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"250-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-positive","answer_start":43,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Streptococcus gordonii?","id":"250-1-3-2","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic","answer_start":29,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Streptococcus gordonii cause?","id":"250-1-3-3","answers":[{"text":"apical periodontitis and infective endocarditis","answer_start":114,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"S. gordonii, a commensal and opportunistic Gram-positive bacterium, plays an important role in the development of apical periodontitis and infective endocarditis. The attachment of S. gordonii to host cells using its adhesion proteins is an essential initiation step for disease development. Once attached, the cell aggregation of S. gordonii leads to biofilm formation on the apical lesions and heart valves. They also continuously interact with host cells, and the molecular interaction led by its cell wall components induces the immune responses. Therefore, S. gordonii may contribute to the progression of diseases due to its attachment, aggregation, and immunostimulatory effects. The bacterial cell wall is involved in important functions of bacteria, such as maintaining bacterial cell shape integrity, and contributing to bacterial growth, reproduction, metabolism, and movement. Therefore, by specifically inhibiting bacterial cell wall components, we could potentially alleviate or even prevent the bacterial infections. The development of novel anti-bacterial molecules, which is involved in targeting specific virulence factors of biofilms, is becoming more important in the prevention and treatment of various bacterial infections including S. gordonii-mediated diseases."}]},{"title":"Streptococcus gordonii: A Rare Cause of Infective Endocarditis","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Streptococcus gordonii cause?","id":"250-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"infective endocarditis","answer_start":531,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Infective endocarditis is a rare but life-threatening disease seen across the globe.

The disease is relatively rare worldwide with an annual incidence of 3\u201310 cases per 100,000 people but carries a short-term mortality of 10 to 30% [3, 4]. Recently, a shift has been seen in the epidemiology of those inflicted with the disease [3]. In the early microbial era, the epidemiology in low- and high-income countries were mirrored by the risk factor of rheumatic heart disease causing IE to be prevalent in young adults [3]. As the incidence of rheumatic heart disease decreased in high-income countries, an epidemiological shift occurred in which the elderly (age over 65) are now more likely to contract the disease [3].  Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus species account for between 80 and 90% of all cases of IE worldwide [3]. The VGS is the most common cause of IE in low-income countries and is one of the most prevalent bacteria in the oral cavity [3]. However, S. gordonii is a rare cause of IE that has been sparsely reported in the literature. S. gordonii are Gram-positive,alpha-hemolytic chains of cocci that play an important role in the alkalization of the oral cavity and protective biofilm production [2]. Once in the blood stream, S. gordonii appear to have the virulence factors that are pathogenic in the development of IE. The cell wall of S. gordonii contains a serine-rich glycoprotein, GspB, which mediates binding to human platelets [5]. After adherence to the platelet, the combination has the potential to attach to the fibronectin-rich extracellular matrix of the cardiac valves and subsequently form valvular vegetations [5]. For almost half a century, oral antibiotic prophylaxis was given to those deemed at risk of developing IE prior to dental procedures [6]. In 1997, the American Heart Association (AHA) noted that most cases of IE were not related to invasive dental procedures but instead due to daily activities such as tooth brushing and chewing [6]. In 2007, the AHA changed their recommendations to ongoing prophylaxis only for those patients at highest risk of developing IE (those with history of infective endocarditis, prosthetic valves, and cardiac transplantation who develop cardiac valvulopathy and congenital heart disease) [7]. Then, in 2008, the United Kingdom (UK) National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence advised for the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis prior to dental procedures citing the lack of strong clinical evidence, the overall low risk of endocarditis arising from dental procedures, and the indiscriminate use of antibiotics [8]. Since the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for IE in the United Kingdom, a small (0.11 cases per 10 million people per month) but statistically significant increase in cases of IE has been noted [9]. Based upon these results, further studies need to be undertaken which involve a placebo-controlled, double blind study to determine the efficacy of IE prophylaxis prior to dental procedures."}]},{"title":"Streptococcus gordonii septic arthritis: two cases and review of literature","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Streptococcus gordonii cause?","id":"250-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"subacute bacterial endocarditis","answer_start":441,"id":1},{"text":"septic arthritis","answer_start":614,"id":2},{"text":"septic arthritis","answer_start":897,"id":3},{"text":"subacute endocarditis","answer_start":827,"id":4}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Despite advances in antimicrobial and surgical therapy, septic arthritis remains a rheumatologic emergency that can lead to rapid joint destruction and irreversible loss of function.

These organisms account for 91% of cases [6]. Gram-negative organisms are more common in older or immunocompromised patients than in young adults. Anaerobic organisms rarely cause septic arthritis, but are more common when there is a history of penetrating trauma [5,14]. The viridans group streptococci is however rarely the causative agent of septic arthritis. S. viridans group is a heterogenous group of organisms with complex and controversial taxonomy. Today, this group is classified into 6 majors groups: S. mutans group, S. salivarius group, S. anginosus group, S. mitis group and S. bovis group [15]. Based on phenotypic reactions, the S. mitis group can be further divided into S. sanguinis (formely known as S. sanguis) that includes S. gordonii, and S. mitis. The viridans group streptococci are part of the commensal flora and have low virulence, and infection with this microorganism usually appears on a previously injured focus [2,15]. However, its association with dental caries and bacterial endocarditis has been well established [2,16]. Comprehensive reviews on the topic does not mention viridans group streptococci as aetiological agents in septic arthritis [5]. However, some isolated cases have been identified, mainly affecting the knee, sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular and sacroiliac joints [2,17-20]. In one of these cases, septic arthritis was associated with bacterial endocarditis [20]. Blankstein et al. [18] described a minor trauma shortly preceding development of septic phenomenon. Alpha-haemolytic streptococci have been implicated in 15 cases of spondylodiscitis, including S. mitis group (S. mitis and S. sanguinis) and S. anginosus[21]. Other members of Streptococcus viridans from S. mitis group (S. sanguinis, and S. oralis) have been described in case-reports as agent of septic arthritis [22-24]. We found no case of Streptococcus gordonii septic arthritis in modern literature. Risk factors for development of joint sepsis include: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarthritis, prosthetic joints, low socioeconomic status, intravenous drug abuse, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, previous intra-articular corticosteroid injection and cutaneous ulcers [5]. A prospective community survey of bacterial arthritis found that a number of factors seem to be associated with poor prognosis. These include older age, pre-existing joint disease and the presence of synthetic material within the joint [25]. Septic arthritis typically presents as a hot, swollen, tender joint or joints with a reduced range of movement. Symptoms are usually present for less than 2 weeks at presentation, but significant delay may occur, particularly with low-virulence organisms, tuberculosis and prosthesis infection. Large joints are more commonly reported than small joints. In up to 60% of cases, the affected joints are the hip or the knee [5,8,26,27]. When there is pre-existing inflammatory joint disease, such as RA, symptoms in the affected joint, or joints, are out of proportion to disease activity detected in other joints [5]. Our first patient is an older patient with poor dental status. We postulated that he experienced transitory bacteriaemia (despite the fact that multiple blood cultures upon admission were negative) and that pre-existing severe degenerative arthritis of the knee promoted bacterial graft on that focus. The second patient is also an older woman with pre-existing valvulopathy and knee arthroplasty. We also postulated that she experienced transitory bacteriaemia and developed endocarditis and prosthetic joint infection. Prompt microscopic analysis and culture of synovial fluid are fundamental diagnostic tools in the evaluation of possible joint sepsis, enabling diagnosis (of both sepsis and crystal-induced arthritis) to be confirmed rapidly. Culture is more sensitive than microscopy alone, as synovial fluid Gram-staining is positive in only 50% of cases. Cytology performed on synovial fluid shows WBC-count of 100.000 cells\/mm on average (between 25000 and 250000 cells\/mm). A cell-count of more than 50.000 cells\/mm with more than 90% of neutrophils makes the diagnosis of septic arthritis highly probable [28]. Coutlakis et al., in their retrospective study on 202 patients, showed that when cell-count on synovial fluid is over 100.000\/mm, 77% of patients had septic arthritis, while 47% of patients were diagnosed with SA if cell-count was between 50.000 and 100.000\/mm. Below the 50.000\/mm-cut-off, diagnosis of SA was less probable [29], though it does not exclude it. A septic arthritis with a WBC-count < 25.000\/mm can be encountered mainly in patients with a history of cancer, those on corticosteroids or in iv-drug abuser, though neutrophil-count remains higher than 90%. In knee arthroplasty, a synovial fluid leucocyte-count of more than 1.7 \u00d7 10\/mm had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 88% for prosthetic joint infection (PJI) [30]. Synovial polymorphonuclear neutrophil differential higher than 65% had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 98% for PJI. Synovial fluid aspiration also enables a search for crystals, to exclude gout or microcrystalline arthritis. Other laboratory studies can be performed, like glucose levels: (SA : glucose < 40 mg\/dL or 50% of glycemia) or lactates (high levels). Though they are not specific, they make diagnosis of septic arthritis more likely [31,32]. The cornerstone of rapid and reliable confirmation of diagnosis of suspected septic arthritis is microbiological examination of synovial fluid. The sensitivity for detection of a causative organisms is, however, often disappointing. It is generally accepted that samples of freshly aspirated joint fluid should be sent to the laboratory for immediate analysis. Different factors have been implicated in the failure to detect the causative organism from patients with septic arthritis including small volume of cultured specimen, purulent exudates that could play an inhibitory effect on bacterial grownth and lower concentration of bacteria in synovial fluid. In this matter, inoculation of synovial fluid into blood culture medium such as BACTEC system (Becton Dickinson diagnostic instrument systems) or paediatric isolator tubes enhances recovery of microorganisms. Inoculation of sterile samples such as synovial fluid directly into BACTEC system is a usual practice in our institution and yielded the aetiologic agent in the two above-mentionned cases. Identification of viridans group streptococci remains difficult by currently manual or automated methods. This, together with taxonomic problems in this group of organisms, have made identification at the species level not always accurate and frequently absent in many reported cases of septic arthritis by viridans group streptococci. Matrix-associated laser desorption ionization-time of fligtht (MALDITOF) is a rapid and cost-effective tool for identification of bacteria cultures. Recent studies comparing ability of this system with biochemical analyses showed that MALDITOF appeared to be a rapid and accurate mode of viridans group streptococci identification [33]. This method yielded the correct identification of S. gordonii in our patients as confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Treatment of septic arthritis differs depending on the joint: native vs prosthetic joint. Prompt treatment with antibiotics together with removal of any purulent material is the mainstay of treatment for septic arthritis. There is little evidence on which to base the choice and duration of antibiotic treatment, and we found no prospective randomised, controlled trials. One systematic review and meta-analysis of antibiotic treatment for joint infections showed no advantage on clinical or bacteriological efficacy of one antibiotic regimen over another [34]. Currently, the choice of antibiotic is based on the likelihood of the organism involved modified by results of Gram-staining and culture. Removal of purulent materiel can be achieved either surgically or through closed needle aspiration. There is controversy over which mode of drainage should be used. Recently, Butt et al. found that 77% of rheumatologists and 66% of orthopaedic surgeons (OS) in the UK recommended surgical joint drainage; 22% and 27%, respectively, recommended repeated closed needle aspiration as their chosen method of joint drainage [35]. However, Ravindran et al., in a recent study comparing medical treatment (serial closed-needle aspiration) and surgical treatment (arthroscopy\/arthrotomy combined with joint washout), showed that for native joint SA, surgical treatment was not superior to medical treatment and, therefore, highlighted the need for careful case selection for surgical intervention [36]. Antimicrobial therapy without implant removal in streptococcal prosthetic joint infections has been reported to be successful in 45 of 63 cases (71%) [37]. Everts et al., in their study on PJI due to Streptococcus treated with antimicrobial therapy and retention of implant, found a success rate of 94% [37].

One 24-year-old male subject, presenting with endocarditis and a history of scarlatina and acute rheumatic fever, received 16 doses of vaccine over a 3-month period, prepared from streptococci isolated from the subject's own blood, yet died 7 days after the final dose (1). Over 100 years later, a safe and effective commercial vaccine against Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus [GAS]) is still not licensed for human use (2,\u20134). GAS causes a diverse range of human infections, both benign and serious, which include pharyngitis, impetigo, cellulitis, scarlet fever, puerperal sepsis, bacteremia, pneumonia, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), necrotizing fasciitis, and endocarditis. In addition, GAS infection can trigger serious postinfectious immune-mediated disorders, including acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) (5,\u20139). Global disease burden figures reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) rank GAS as the ninth leading infectious cause of human mortality, with the majority of deaths being attributable to invasive infections and RHD, primarily in nonindustrialized countries (5, 10). Several studies had noted a reduction in GAS disease burden in industrialized countries in the mid-20th century (11,\u201314). However, in the last 50 years, there have been widespread reports of significant outbreaks of ARF (15, 16), APSGN (17, 18), GAS invasive disease (14, 19,\u201321), puerperal sepsis (22,\u201324), and scarlet fever (25, 26). Treatment regimens for GAS infections naturally center on the use of appropriate antibiotics. GAS remains exquisitely and universally sensitive to penicillin, while antibiotics such as cephalosporins, macrolides, and clindamycin are also used clinically (27,\u201329). In some regions of the world, GAS resistance to antibiotics such as macrolides, clindamycin, and lincosamide has become an increasing concern (25,\u201328, 30), and epidemiological vigilance is required to ensure that treatment matches the antibiotic sensitivity profile of circulating GAS strains. The human population is the only known natural reservoir for GAS, and thus, a safe and effective human vaccine holds the promise of reducing disease burden and blocking transmission and even has the potential to eradicate this important human pathogen. Hurdles for the development of a safe human vaccine include significant genetic diversity and antigenic variability among GAS strains and, crucially, the prerequisite to ensure that any vaccine antigen does not trigger autoimmune sequelae such as ARF and APSGN (2,\u20134, 31, 32). Significant progress has been made in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying GAS disease pathogenesis. Recently, this work has been accelerated by publications of numerous GAS genome sequences (33,\u201341), which have greatly facilitated molecular investigations of virulence. A large number of GAS virulence determinants have been characterized, many of which exhibit functional redundancy in the processes of adhesion and colonization, resistance to innate immunity, and the capacity to spread within the human host. Based on such molecular data, disease models have been formulated for progression to severe disease outcomes such as invasive infection, STSS, ARF, and APSGN. Unraveling the contribution of GAS virulence factors to specific disease processes will provide an improved basis for targeted therapeutic intervention."}]},{"title":"Pathogenesis of group A streptococcal infections","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Streptococcus pyogenes cause?","id":"251-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"mild infections such as pharyngitis and impetigo","answer_start":195,"id":1},{"text":"life threatening conditions including necrotizing fasciitis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), and bacteremia","answer_start":260,"id":2},{"text":"non-suppurative sequelae, acute rheumatic fever, and acute glomerulonephritis","answer_start":426,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Streptococcus pyogenes sensitive to?","id":"251-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"penicillin","answer_start":545,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Group A Streptococcus (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes) is a human pathogen which causes significant morbidity and mortality globally.

The M protein (emm type) is a critical virulence factor. Several studies have shown an increased incidence of invasive S. pyogenes disease. This was associated with an increase in the prevalence of M1 and M3 types, well-recognised virulent M types. The aim of the present study was to confirm the resurgence of invasive S. pyogenes disease during 2011-2018 and to identify the relationship between specific M types with disease presentation.    Material and methods:  Isolates were confirmed using standard techniques: colony morphology, \u03b2-haemolysis, biochemical tests, and agglutination with specific antisera (DiaMondiaL Strep Kit, DiaMondiaL, Langenhagen, Germany). The antibiotic sensitivity was performed using microdilution (Vitek\u00ae2 Compact, bioMeri\u00e9ux, Inc., Durham, NC). Molecular analysis included the determination of the emm gene and superantigen profile.    Results:  A total of 29 invasive isolates were collected (2011-2018) from blood (16), pleural fluid (9), synovial fluid (3), and cerebrospinal fluid (1). One strain per year was isolated between 2011 and 2013, with 2, 5, 4, 6, and 9 strains being isolated between 2014 and 2018, respectively. The most frequent clinical presentations were bacteraemia and pneumonia (10 and 9 cases). The predominant types were M1 (11 isolates) and M3 (3 isolates). A correlation was found between M1 and M3 types, and pneumonia (6\/7 cases) and deep soft tissue infections (3\/3 cases).    Conclusions:  An increased incidence of invasive S. pyogenes disease was observed during the study period, with M1 and M3 types being those most commonly isolated and associated with pneumonia and deep soft tissue infections.

Streptococcus cristatus strains are described as Gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci, approximately 1 \u03bcm in diameter growing in chains (Fig. 3a and \u200band3b)3b) and were originally isolated from the human throat and oral cavities. Based on the clustering patterns resulting from core genome phylogenetic analysis, Jensen et al. later concluded Streptococcus oligofermentans as a synonym of Streptococcus cristatus and classified them under Streptococcus mitis group. Typical human habitats of this species of streptococci are the oropharynx, epithelial surfaces of the oral cavity, teeth, skin, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. Its association with endocarditis and septicaemia has been reported but there is no literature regarding its association with bone and joint infections. Intrapartum transmission is responsible for most cases of early-onset neonatal infection and is the likely cause in our patient. (a\u2013b): 3a: Agar plate showing growth of Streptococcus cristatus. 3b: Microscopic view showing Streptococcus cristatus. Strong et al. had reported septic arthritis of 7 wrists in 6 infants in 1995. All of them had the affection of more than one joint. In their series, the youngest child was 3 days old (range 3\u2013145 days). Four of these wrists were treated with multiple aspirations whereas three were not timely diagnosed and had no surgical treatment. All patients in their series had a good function with no complaints of pain at final follow up. In contrast, there was isolated involvement of wrist joint in our case report and the age of the child was 5 days old when wrist swelling was first noticed. Rushkoff ES et al. reported septic arthritis of twenty-nine wrists in twenty-eight patients. There were only two children but none of them was of neonatal age group. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly recovered organism. All of them were treated with early surgical drainage, parenteral antibiotics, and early mobilization after surgical decompression. They found that the long-term results deteriorated in direct proportion to the delay in surgical decompression and cases which were drained after sixteen hours of diagnosis had a fair or poor outcome. In our case, arthrotomy of the wrist joint and surgical decompression was carried out within 10 hours of diagnosis. The duration of antibiotics for septic arthritis depends on the involved organism, at least 3 weeks for Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative organisms, 2\u20133 weeks for Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B Streptococcus, group A Streptococcus, Hemophilus influenzae, and K. kingae. Antibiotics are continued for 2 weeks in case of culture-negative specimens. However, most of the time it is individualized depending on the overall recovery of the patient, type of joint involved and on improving inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP). In most cases of neonatal septic arthritis, the duration of antibiotics is 3\u20134 weeks. In cases of accompanying osteomyelitis, a longer antibiotic course of 4\u20136 weeks may be required. In reported patient, as the aspirated fluid was purulent and suspicion of Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was high, vancomycin was chosen empirically. After culture and sensitivity, vancomycin was continued for 4 weeks based on patient recovery, neonatal age, delayed identification of species and limited information regarding this rare bacterial infection. Oral therapy has been used successfully to complete treatment of septic arthritis in neonates, but the absorption of antibiotics in this age range is unpredictable. At one year follow up the child had full, painless range of motion with no functional deficit (Fig. 2a and \u200band2b).2b). He can crawl with full weight bearing. Final follow up x rays of the left wrist are not showing any signs of limb length discrepancy, angular defects, or growth arrest (Fig. 2c and \u200band2d).2d).

Abiotrophia defectiva is a part of the normal flora of the oral cavity, the urogenital and the intestinal tracts [4]. Immunosuppression, pregnancy, and prosthetic valves are the common predisposing factors for this rare infection [5]. In one of the first reported cases of endocarditis due to Abiotrophia defectiva in Korea, the patient who was on post- mitral valve replacement (MVR) had developed the infection following a tooth extraction and was treated successfully with appropriate antibiotics and a second MVR [2]. A case had been reported where a 26-year-old pregnant female was diagnosed to have endocarditis due to Abiotrophia defectiva, secondary to a biofilm-related infection caused by the presence of fixed braces [6]. Our case is unique since the patient did not have any known pre-disposing factors for the disease at the time of presentation. NVS are known to cause 5%\u22126% of all streptococcal endocarditis cases, out of which <1% of all endocarditis cases are caused by Abiotrophia defectiva [7]. Approximately 125 cases have been published in the literature so far, out of which one published case was complicated by hemophagocytic syndrome [6]. These bacteria do not synthesize pyridoxine, L-cysteine or other essential nutrients required for growth and depend on other bacteria or enriched media to proliferate. Due to this reason, the initial cultures in our study were found to be sterile. Molecular biology technicals allow quicker diagnosis, which can lead to better prognosis [8]. Suspicion regarding this organism should arise in cases of culture-negative endocarditis and additional testing with supplemented media should be performed to encourage growth of colonies [5,9]. A.defective is a pleomorphic organism, appearing as Gram-positive cocci, coccobacilli, and bacilli forms depending on the culture media [10]. Literature suggests that due to the production of a considerable amount exopolysaccharides, the organism has a higher affinity for the endocardium and the ability to bind with fibronectin in the extracellular matrix, further contributes to their virulence [2,9].  Infections due to Abiotrophia defectiva are known to cause septic embolization and mortality [11]. Our patient\u2019s case was complicated by the presence of septic emboli in the spleen and also the presence of multiple ischemic foci in the brain. Since these bacteria are also frequently penicillin-resistant, the American Heart Association recommends using the same treatment regime as that used for Enterococcus endocarditis, which consists of ampicillin or penicillin G in addition to gentamicin for a four to six weeks period [12]. Ceftriaxone combined with gentamycin is an alternative option [11]. This combination, involving intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamicin was successfully used to treat our patient.  Despite the sensitivity to antimicrobials, approximately 50% of patients need surgical management [13]. Lin et al. published a study involving eight cases of NVS endocarditis, out of which seven of the cases were associated with large vegetation size, that is, greater than 10 mm. Eventually, seven of the eight cases went on to have valve replacement, performed either because of vegetation size or severe heart failure [14]. A rare case of a quadruple valve IE due to Abiotrophia defectiva has also been reported in a patient with pre-existing ventricular septal defect. The patient was successfully managed surgically [9]. In our case report, the patient was managed medically with appropriate antibiotic therapy and has been feeling symptomatically better during the follow-up visits.

Bouvet et al. identified two species of NVS; Streptococcus defectivus and Streptococcus adjacens [7]. In 1995, Kawamura et al. identified Abiotrophia as a separate genus, based on 16S rRNA analyses [8]. NVS are part of the normal flora of the mouth and urogenital and intestinal tracts [1]. Recently, an increasing number of cases have been described of A. defectiva isolates recovered from invasive and non-invasive infections following dental procedures [9]. Abiotrophia spp., has fastidious culturing and the unspecific colony morphology that they presents on primary detection, such strains have caused major diagnostic difficulties. Thus, it has been supposed that many culture-negative endocarditis could have been caused by these species, which could have lead to an underestimation as pathogens of infective endocarditis [10]. In this case report, we identified A. defectiva by MALDI-TOF-MS. MALDI-TOF-MS is a new technology for routine identification of bacteria in clinical microbiology laboratories. Much of the work using MALDI-TOF-MS for microbial identification has focused on demonstrating that reproducible mass spectra can be obtained using intact cells and developing algorithms for interpretation and comparison of these spectra. By testing colonies, it takes only a few minutes to have a correct identification which makes not only possible to identify the microorganisms at the species levels but sometimes at the sub-species and strains levels, allowing the detection of epidemic lineages [11]. A. defectiva can cause serious infections such as bacteremia, osteomyelitis, brain abscess, pancreatic abscess, septic arthritis, crystalline keratopathy and in rare cases, infective endocarditis [3,12]. Endocarditis caused by NVS is implicated in 5\u22126% of all streptococcal endocarditis cases, and <1% of all endocarditis cases are caused by A. defective [3]. However, A. defectiva has a higher affinity for the endocardium because of its ability secrete exopolysaccharide, enabling it to adhere to fibronectin in the extracellular matrix [2]. Of all the NVS-induced endocarditis patients, 90% suffered from heart disease, and in most cases, bacteremia associated with the pre-existing valvular heart disease led to the development of endocarditis with subacute prognoses [13]. Infective endocarditis caused by A. defectiva and other NVS had higher mortality, morbidity and complication rates than those caused by other viridans streptococci [14]. Most deaths were due to refractory congestive cardiac failure or major systemic emboli [15]. A mortality rate of up to 17% has been reported, which is higher compared to endocarditis caused by viridians streptococci (0\u221212%) [4]. The relapse rate can also be up to 17% in some cases. Previous studies have shown a treatment failure rate as high as 41%, despite the use of appropriate antibiotics [5]. The antibiotic regimen to combat A. defectiva endocarditis includes penicillin or ampicillin, plus an aminoglycoside or vancomycin for cases of antimicrobial resistance, taken for 4\u22126 weeks [16]. Infective endocarditis due to A. defectiva progresses slowly, but despite its sensitivity to antimicrobials ~50% of cases need surgical management. Surgical treatment combined with concurrent antimicrobial therapy result in better prognoses, and the main indications for surgery are persistent sepsis and vegetation, severe congestive heart failure and recurrent embolism [15,17,18]. In Korea, 2 cases of infective endocarditis caused by S. adjacens were first reported in 1996. Since then, a case of infective endocarditis by Grnulicatella adjacens was reported in 2010. All cases were successfully treated with antibiotics and surgical treatment [19,20]. After classified as A. defectiva, this is the first report as the pathogen of infective endocarditis in Korea. The case presented here is an example of the successful treatment of infective endocarditis caused by A. defectiva following a tooth extraction in a post-MVR patient, and represents the first reported case of infective endocarditis caused by A. defectiva in Korea. This case shows that A. defectiva could be considered as a causative organism of infective endocarditis in Korea."}]},{"title":"Rare but Not Infrequent: Infective Endocarditis Caused by Abiotrophia defectiva","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can A. defectiva cause?","id":"254-4-1-1","answers":[{"text":"infective endocarditis","answer_start":1095,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Endocarditis (IE) is defined by an infection of a native or prosthetic heart valve, the mural endocardium, or an indwelling cardiac device.

In 1989, Bouvet and colleagues reclassified this organism into Streptococcus defectivus and Streptococcus adjacens, based on the DNA-DNA hybridization studies [3\u20135]. Later, in 1995, Kawamura and colleagues [5] created a new genus Abiotrophia, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data and other phylogenetic analysis, and transferred these two species to the new genus as Abiotrophia defectiva and Abiotrophia adiacens. A. defectiva are classified as nonmotile, Gram-positive cocci in chains that are catalase negative and exhibit satellitism around colonies of other bacteria. Abiotrophia means \u201clife nutrition deficiency\u201d and refers to the species' requirements for supplemented media for growth. Due to the fastidious nutritional requirements, the organism grow either in the media enriched with pyridoxin and L-cystine, or in the absence of supplements, a streak of Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis provides suitable culture conditions, where these species grow as satellite colonies adjacent to the helper Staphylococcus species. Abiotrophia species are part of the normal microbiota of the oral cavity, but can also be found in the urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts, and can cause severe infections such as bacteremia, brain abscess, pancreatic abscess, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and in the rare occasion, endocarditis [1, 4, 6, 7]. Approximately, 5 to 6% of streptococcal endocarditis is caused by NVS [1, 4, 7]. Several studies have suggested the organism's higher affinity for endocardium due to the production of a significant amount of exopolysaccharide and propensity to bind with fibronectin in the extracellular matrix, which further expands their virulence [4, 6]. Preexisting valvular heart disease or other cardiac conditions are frequently associated with NVS-induced endocarditis [6]. Strict nutritional demand, fastidious nature, and delayed initiation of the appropriate antibiotic regimen have made this microbe a challenge to identify and treat.  Abiotrophia defectiva has displayed a notable tolerance to penicillin, and its minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of penicillin markedly exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration (MBC\/MIC), typically by 32-fold [8]. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests (ASTs) were performed on 132 clinical NVS, collected from 2008 to 2014, which revealed that 90% of the isolates have the higher level of penicillin resistance. However, A. defectiva is sensitive to vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and aminoglycoside [7]. A possible explanation of penicillin resistance is, under suboptimal nutritional conditional or if exposed to either penicillin or muralytic enzymes in a hypertonic medium, the organism produces L-forms that partially or entirely lack a cell wall, thus rendering antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis ineffective [1, 4, 9]. The American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend that the treatment regimen used is the same as that used for Enterococcus endocarditis [10], that is, a combination of ampicillin or benzyl penicillin plus gentamicin for a period of 4\u20136 weeks. Alternatively, vancomycin can be used alone (without gentamicin) for six weeks for patients with penicillin allergy. Ceftriaxone combined with gentamicin may be an alternative treatment option for isolates with a penicillin MIC \u22650.5 \u00b5g\/mL that are susceptible to ceftriaxone [10]."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Abiotrophia defectiva cause?","id":"254-4-4-1","answers":[{"text":"endocarditis","answer_start":48,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"In summary, this case illustrates an example of endocarditis by the rare but not uncommon pathogen, Abiotrophia defectiva.

Each year Shigella species cause 165 million cases of shigellosis with an estimated 1.1 million of those cases resulting in death (Kotloff et al. 2013). For 3 years, the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) identified pathogens, such as Shigella and pathogenic Escherichia coli, believed to be a cause of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) in children aged 0\u201359 months in the endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (Kotloff et al. 2013). GEMS was an age stratified, matched case-control study that demonstrated that Shigella were consistently in the top five of all cases of MSD in each of the age groups (Farag et al. 2013). There are four species of Shigella: Shigella sonnei, S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae and Shigella boydii, each with their own global burdens and epidemiological profile (Livio et al. 2014). From the 1130 Shigella isolates collected during the 36 months of the GEMS, 5.4% (61\/1130) were identified as S. boydii (Livio et al. 2014). While this is a proportionally small contribution to the overall observed cases of MSD compared to the other three Shigella species, S. boydii still makes up a significant component of the overall Shigella burden (Baker, Parkhill and Thomson 2015). By increasing the number and diversity of S. boydii genomes available to the scientific community, further functional studies can focused on this understudied and underreported pathogen. Considering the burden of disease caused by Shigella, there are relatively few Shigella genomic studies (Wei et al. 2003; Yang et al. 2005); however, recent studies on S. sonnei (Holt et al. 2012, 2013) and S. flexneri (Connor et al. 2015) genomics have detailed the temporal and spatial virulence of these species. The 28 S. boydii isolates sequenced in this study represent all of the S. boydii isolates identified at the Bangladesh and The Gambia GEMS sites during the first 24 months. A total of 31 S. boydii isolates were identified at these two sites over the complete GEMS 36 month period (24 in Bangladesh and 7 in The Gambia; Livio et al. 2014), thus we have examined the majority of the isolates from these two sites. These 28 S. boydii genomes from GEMS were compared with 14 S. boydii isolates already in the public domain, labeled in this study as \u2018historical isolates\u2019 (Table 1). By presenting these genomes along with corresponding clinical and phylogenomic data, this study will begin to shed light on this pathogen and allow a deeper understanding of the role of this organism in the broader context of global Shigella infections.  Shigella boydii isolates examined. In total, 28 S. boydii genomes were identified for sequencing and analysis from the 727 Shigella isolates obtained from Bangladesh and the Gambia during the GEMS (Kotloff et al. 2013; Livio et al. 2014). Multiple studies on the GEMS including the interpretation of the clinical, epidemiologic and microbial findings have been published (Farag et al. 2013; Lindsay et al. 2013; Baker, Parkhill and Thomson 2015; Sahl et al. 2015), and the genomic studies are now underway. In the current study, we have included 14 S. boydii genomes that had been published previously (Rasko et al. 2008; Sahl et al. 2015), including the first S. boydii genome that was in the public domain (strain BS512, (aka CDC 3083\u201394); serotype 18, Assembly Accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NC_010658\",\"term_id\":\"187730020\",\"term_text\":\"NC_010658\"}}NC_010658). For all GEMS isolates, genomic DNA was prepared as previously described with established methods (Sahl et al. 2011) taking precautions to minimize the passage number. The genome sequence of each GEMS isolate was generated at the Institute for Genome Sciences, Genome Resource Center on the Illumina HiSeq2000 using paired-end libraries with 300 bp inserts. The draft genomes were assembled using Minimus (Sommer et al. 2007) to merge contigs generated using two different assemblers, Velvet assembly program (Zerbino and Birney 2008) (with kmer values determined using VelvetOptimiser v2.1.4 (http:\/\/bioinformatics.net.au\/software.velvetoptimiser.shtml)), and the Edena v3 assembler (Hernandez et al. 2008). The metrics for the resulting assemblies corresponding GenBank accession and SRA numbers are presented in Table 1. For the S. boydi 3083\u201394, genomic DNA for sequencing was isolated from a stock culture and two Sanger sequencing libraries were constructed \u2014a small insert library (4\u20135 kb) and a large insert library (10\u201312 kb) from which 20 656 and 47 348 reads were sequenced, respectively. The CDC 3083\u201394 genome was assembled as previously described (Rasko et al. 2008). The 72 E. coli and Shigella genomes were aligned using Mugsy (Angiuoli and Salzberg 2011), and homologous blocks were concatenated using the bx-python toolkit (https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/james_taylor\/bx-python). The columns that contained one or more gaps were removed using Mothur (Schloss et al. 2009). These concatenated regions from each genome were used to construct a maximum-likelihood phylogeny with 100 bootstrap replicates using RAxML v7.2.8 (Stamatakis 2006) and visualized using FigTree v1.4.2 (http:\/\/tree.bio.ed.ac.uk\/software\/figtree\/) (Fig. 1). Additionally, the level of similarity of protein-encoding genes was compared between the 42 S. boydii genomes in this study using a large-scale BLAST score ratio (LS-BSR) analysis as previously described (Hazen et al. 2013; Sahl et al. 2013, 2014). Protein-encoding genes were predicted for each genome sequence using Prodigal (Hyatt et al. 2010). The genes were then combined into gene clusters using uclust (Edgar 2010), and the gene clusters were assigned using a stringent nucleotide identity threshold of \u226590%. The protein-encoding genes that were considered present, with significant similarity had BSR values \u22650.8, while those with BSR values <0.8 but \u22650.4 were considered to be present but divergent and <0.4 were considered absent. The predicted protein function of each gene cluster was determined using an ergatis-based (Orvis et al. 2010) in-house annotation pipeline (Galens et al. 2011). Phylogenomic tree containing GEMS S. boydii isolates (white circles), S. boydii isolates that are currently in public databases (gray circles) and a collection of reference E. coli and Shigella species genomes (black circles). Three clades of S. boydii isolates are identified by color with clade 1 in blue (broken into two smaller subclades as denoted by the shades of blue), clade 2 in red and clade 3 in green. The tree was inferred with Figtree 1.4.2 with Bootstrap support values from 100 replicates are shown at the black square nodes. Distance for the number of nucleotide changes is shown to be 0.0040 with corresponding bar length. The 42 S. boydii genomes from the 28 GEMS isolates and 14 historical isolates represent a collection of isolates that are geographically and temporally distributed (Table 1). The average genome size of the 28 GEMS S. boydii isolates examined is 4397 328 bp (range 4158 234\u20134758 784 bp). The average number of contigs in this collection is 493 (range 300\u2013801 contigs), and the average GC percent is 50.75% (range 50.36%\u201351.19%). These values are typical of previously generated Shigella species genomes (Holt et al. 2012, 2013; Sangal et al. 2013; Connor et al. 2015; Sahl et al. 2015). The phylogenomic analysis of the genomes was completed using the Mugsy algorithm (Angiuoli and Salzberg 2011). The alignment utilized in this reference-independent comparison contains \u223c3.0 Mb which was a greater amount of genomic content than previous Shigella comparisons with this method (Sahl et al. 2015), suggesting a high level of conservation within the isolates of this species. The inferred phylogeny also identifies the S. boydii genomes as being separated from any of the E. coli reference genomes (Fig. 1). This E. coli and Shigella separation has been identified previously (Rasko et al. 2008; Tenaillon et al. 2010; Sahl et al. 2015). Additionally, phylogenomic analysis demonstrated that the S. boydii are separated into three clades (labeled clades 1, 2 and 3 in Fig. 1), with clade 1 potentially able to be further subdivided into two additional subgroups (Fig. 1). This data suggest that S. boydii clade 1 potentially diverged from clades 2 and 3 at an earlier point in the development of the S. boydii species (Fig. 1). This pattern is similarly observed in a global Shigella analyses recently published by our group (Sahl et al. 2015); however, the number of S. boydii isolates in that analyses were limited compared to our current study. The comparisons included in this study are the greatest number of S. boydii compared in any one study, 42 isolates. Interestingly, the S. boydii isolates do not segregate by any specific geographic location or date of isolation, suggesting that this study has captured the genomic diversity of this species of Shigella. Both spatially and temporally, the new isolates from GEMS are distributed alongside the historic S. boydii isolates and are distributed between the three S. boydii clades (Table 1). This indicates that this GEMS collection of isolates has captured the diversity of the S. boydii species. Analysis of the gene content via LS-BSR (Sahl et al. 2014) identified total of 7355 gene clusters in the 28 GEMS Shigella genomes. Among those gene clusters, a core S. boydii genome of 2477 gene clusters that are present in all S. boydii genomes examined. Comparing the gene clusters of the 28 GEMS genomes to the 14 previously sequenced S. boydii genomes identifies a core genome of 2230 genes that were present with significant similarity in the 42 of the S. boydii genomes in this study. When the phylogenomic data from Fig. 1 is combined with the LS-BSR data, protein-encoding genes that are clade specific were identified. Annotation of these specific regions also provided potential insight into the gene function for the unique genes in these three clades. Unique genes are present in all of the isolates in the clade of interest, but lacking in the isolates from the other clades. Shigella boydii clade 1 had 98 unique genes compared to S. boydii clades 2 and 3, which had only 4 and 12 unique genes, respectively (Table 2; Table S2, Supporting Information). The clade-specific S. boydii genes included inner membrane components for a transport system and zinc-binding proteins from clade 1, several phage component proteins from clade 2 and two integrase family proteins from clade 3 (Table S2, Supporting Information). There were also several hypothetical proteins that were identified as clade specific: 13 from clade 1, 4 from clade 2 and zero from clade 3. Why and how these unique genes arose solely in S. boydii clade one creates another reason S. boydii requires further functional analysis. Gene prevalence in S. boydii clades. If the criteria for clade specificity are broadened to identify prevalent genes (i.e. genes present in >90% of isolates of one clade but in <20% of the isolates of the other two clades), these numbers increases to 128 genes in S. boydii clade 1, 56 genes in S. boydii clade 2 and 38 genes in S. boydii clade 3 (Table 2; Table S2, Supporting Information). The relatively larger increase observed in S. boydii clades 2 and 3 suggests that there is more overlap within the gene content of these clades when compared to the content of clade 1. This further suggests a distinct separation of the members of S. boydii clade 1 from other S. boydii. This increased gene repertoire contains transmembrane proteins in clade 1, phage-associated proteins in clade 2 (tail subunits, head-tail connectors and phage portal proteins) and a collection of phage and metabolism proteins in clade 3 (Table S2, Supporting Information). Similar approaches to the ones used have been utilized in the past to identify common features that are in use as PCR-based diagnostics for Shigella (Sahl et al. 2015) and E. coli (Hazen et al. 2013; Sahl et al. 2013, 2014).  Shigella is a pervasive human pathogen that causes life-threatening disease. Genomics of understudied pathogens like S. boydii will allow continued development in the fields of pathogen identification, phylogenetic categorization and potential functional characterization of the identified clade- and species-specific genomic regions."}]}]},{"species":"Shigella sonnei","docs":[{"title":"Shigella sonnei: virulence and antibiotic resistance","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Shigella sonnei cause?","id":"257-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"shigellosis","answer_start":100,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Shigella sonnei is the emerging pathogen globally, as it is the second common infectious species of shigellosis (bloody diarrhoea) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and the leading one in developed world.

In last, prevention and controlling strategies are briefed to limit and tackle S. sonnei and possible future areas are also explored that needed more research to unravel the hidden mysteries surrounding S. sonnei."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Shigella sonnei is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"257-1-2-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":20,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can S. sonnei cause?","id":"257-1-2-2","answers":[{"text":"shigellosis","answer_start":2721,"id":1},{"text":"shigellosis","answer_start":29926,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are S. sonnei sensitive to?","id":"257-1-2-3","answers":[{"text":"Ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, sulphonamide, and trimethoprim","answer_start":27363,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Shigella sonnei's requirement for oxygen?","id":"257-1-2-4","answers":[{"text":"facultatively anaerobic","answer_start":39,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Shigella sonnei?","id":"257-1-2-5","answers":[{"text":"rod","answer_start":34,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"The Shigella is the Gram-negative rod, facultatively anaerobic, non-spore forming and non-motile bacterial genera belongs to Enterobacteriaceae family and comprise of four major species S. dysenteriae, S. boydii, S. flexneri and S. sonnei (Chatterjee and Raval 2019). Shigella species stand apart from Enterobacteriaceae due to their unique nature, mechanisms of pathogenesis and evolutionary history (The et al. 2016). Kiyoshi Shiga in 1897 from Japan, first isolated the highly virulent strain S. dysenteriae that produce exotoxins (Trofa et al. 1999; Lampel et al. 2018). The other species were discovered later, S. flexneri in 1899, S. sonnei by Carl Olaf Sonne in 1906 and Shigella boydii in 1921 (Barceloux 2008). Because of diverse antigenicity based on lipopolysaccharides (LPS), O-antigen components in cell wall, Shigella species has further serotypes and sub-serotypes. The serotype 1 of Shigella dysenteries (formerly Shigella bacillus), has 15 types, S. flexneri has 19, S. boydii has 20, however, S. sonnei has just only 1 serotype (Wu et al. 2019). Several studies indicate that, the Shigella spp. are geographically distributed based on the economic development of countries (Anderson et al. 2016). The most of the Shigella infection are caused by S. flexneri as highlighted as an emerging pathogen in a recent review (Nisa et al. 2020). In past, S. flexneri infections have been associated worldwide (Gentle et al. 2016), while S. sonnei has been found to be in association with the developed world only. The sequencing of eight housekeeping chromosomal genes showed that the Shigella spp. contain three major clades (C1, C2 and C3) and an outgroup member to these clades named S. sonnei (Pupo et al. 2000). However, a study assumes that S. sonnei emerged later than the other types of Shigella spp. and are more in developed world than developing world, probably, because low-resource countries show more immunity to S. sonnei as exposure of faecal contaminated water that contains Pleisiomonas Shigelloides O17 having identical antigen to S. sonnei (Shepherd et al. 2000). A more recent genomic study indicated that, S. sonnei emerged from E. coli in central Europe ~ 1500 AD (Holt et al. 2012) and spread intercontinentally through travellers. S. sonnei significantly dependent on economic and industrial development of regions (Qiu et al. 2015) and now showing dominance over S. flexneri due to several mechanisms. However, S. sonnei rate of infections trend is replacing S. flexneri and has been changing substantially over time, shifting towards low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly in Asia (Thompson et al. 2015). Globally, Shigella spp. are strict human pathogens, accounts for shigellosis (bloody diarrhoea) and associated with huge proportion of morbidity and mortality (Khalil et al. 2018; Kotloff et al. 2018). The annual deaths estimated to be 212 438 in group of all ages due to Shigella infections and children of age < 5 are more prone to shigellosis leading to 75 million cases each year (Khalil et al. 2018). Moreover, military forces and international travellers are also susceptible to Shigella (Porter et al. 2017). The encoding of T6SS in S. sonnei favours the propagation and survival efficiently as compare with S. flexneri (lacks T6SS), while also commensally target E. coli (Anderson et al. 2017). S. sonnei has been found to adapt and equipped with antimicrobial resistance genes more profoundly through mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as plasmids, transposons, insertion sequences and genomic islands (Muthuirulandi Sethuvel et al. 2017) as compared with S. flexneri (Thompson et al. 2015). The synergistic effect of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) alongside with integrons (genetic elements that acquire or exchange exogenous DNA, called as gene cassettes by site-specific recombination) further increases the emergence and survival rate (Ahmed et al. 2006). In another study ubiquitously existing, free living amoeba called Acanthamoebae castellanii has found to phagocytosize S. sonnei protecting it from chlorination and environmental damage (Saeed et al. 2009), however, contrary to this, in a recent study, it has been shown that although A. castellanii phagocytosize S. sonnei but it does not be able to survive or grow in the cytosol of A. castellanii (Watson et al. 2018). Additionally, it has also been found that the O-antigen of S. sonnei inhibits internalization, vacuole escape and inflammasome activation, this different approach further stands out S. sonnei from other Gram-negative enteropathogenic E. coli and Salmonella spp. (Watson et al. 2019). Thus, in the light of such versatile weapons, S. sonnei has an edge over the closely related and to the different species as well (Starling 2017). Therefore, the spectrum of recent studies actively demands for looking more alternative approaches in determining and characterization of the actual cause of S. sonnei infections persistence. This review aimed to highlight the S. sonnei, as an emerging pathogen in the light of recent research and findings. The gaps which recent studies has filled and further urged to look for more possible underlying mysterious mechanisms including epidemiological features, and evolving mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance patterns of S. sonnei are discussed. As, the global expansion of ciprofloxacin and fluoroquinolone-resistant S. sonnei (De Lappe et al. 2015; Chung The et al. 2016, 2019; The and Baker 2018) exacerbated the antimicrobial resistance issue worldwide. The comprehensive knowledge about S. sonnei attempted to be documented here, that lead to establish a clearer picture in understanding of this deadly pathogen as to overcome and tackle it has been a serious emerging problem. S. sonnei accounts for up to 80% of all the Shigella infections in developed world, particularly in North America and Europe (Gu et al. 2012) and has caused several outbreaks, for example, in California between 2014 and 2015 (Kozyreva et al. 2016). For instance, S. sonnie has significantly contributed to foodborne outbreaks as well in America and Canada, highlighting the food items as the major source (Lee et al. 1991; Naimi et al. 2003; Kimura et al. 2004). In Spain, a study associated the S. sonnei infections upon the consumption of fresh pasteurized milk cheese (Garc\u00eda-Fulgueiras et al. 2001). In Australia, S. sonnei prevalence rate has been identified up to 55.6% of all Shigella infections in year 2010 (OzFoodNet Working Group 2012). In a different study, the foodborne outbreak of S. sonnei has also been reported and raw carrots were identified as the potential vehicle among air passengers departed from Hawaii to Japan (Gaynor et al. 2009), pointing towards the expanding landscape of transmission horizon. Prior to this, a study has pinpointed S. sonnei (from a packing shed of baby corn in Thailand) as the potential cause of foodborne outbreak in Denmark and Australia (Lewis et al. 2009). Additionally, the foodborne outbreaks due to S. sonnei has also been reported in youth-trip from Austria (Kuo et al. 2009) and associated the consumption of raw peas as a potential source of infection in Denmark (Muller et al. 2009). However, the global trend of infections due to S. sonnei has changed drastically over time from developed to developing countries due to evolving mechanisms and different infection causing modes in S. sonnei (Torraca et al. 2020). The frequency of outbreaks and respective severity differ across regions due to multifactorial elements based on geography, climate, host\u2013pathogen relationships, and corresponding controlling strategies. A study from Bangladesh, estimated the trending changes of Shigella spp. and observed that the prevalence of S. sonnei increased from 7.2% to 25% in 2001\u20132011, respectively (Ud-Din et al. 2013). Recently, three main lineages of S. sonnei (I, II, III) have been identified. S. sonnei evolved rapidly from Europe and spread as multi-drug-resistant (MDR) single lineage to other continents dominantly (Holt et al. 2012; Anandan et al. 2017). The single clone was named as \u201cGlobal lineage III\u201d (see Table \u200bTable11). Dissemination of MDR S. sonnei Global lineage III from Europe (Holt et al. 2012) MDR multi-drug resistant In Taiwan, the rate of infections caused by Shigella is rare, while S. sonnei reported cases were 16 from 200 to 2003 and only one case reported in 2006. The genotypic data showed that, the reducing rate of infection was probably due to limited travelling and contact between villages population, lead to conclude that public health intervention as one of the best controlling strategy (Ko et al. 2013). Furthermore, the serotype shift has been documented in a recent research note and accounted the prevalence of S. sonnei infections steadily increased from 2003 to 2011 (17.4\u201358.2%) in China (Qiu et al. 2015). A recent broad-spectrum study from Korea, investigated the Shigella spp. dysentery infections rate and reported the steady increase of S. sonnei infections from 1954 to 2004 (50 years), thus concluding the substantial change of S. flexneri to S. sonnei serotype (Pai 2020). S. sonnei also found predominantly in one study from Africa, four in Asia and two in South America (Kahsay and Muthupandian 2016). The very low infectious dose rate of about of 1\u2013100 cells results in severe outbreaks and transmission. S. sonnei along with other Shigella species shares the common mode of reservoirs and transmission pattern, including water, food, wild animals, birds, insects, and amoeba (Bridle 2013). Humans are the primary host and transmission primarily occurred through fecal\u2013oral route. The infections caused by Shigella spp. are highly contagious and considered as most infectious as compared to other bacterial entero-pathogens (DuPont 2014). However, the bacterium cannot survive out long without host for continuous transmission (Niyogi 2005). The contamination of water and food, fomites, poor sanitation, and ecological conditions also aid in the persistence of S. sonnei that result in emerging of severe kind of outbreaks (Taneja and Mewara 2016). For instance, only 40% of Indian population has access to good sanitation system, this further escalate the infections rate in the region (The World Bank 2015). S. sonnei has ability to turn into viable but non-culturable form (VBNC), thus aiding in the survival and then transmission later on, when conditions become favourable (Nicol\u00f2 et al. 2011). Shigella sonnei possess capability to survive seven weeks on soiled linen, 5 days in freshwater environment, while 12\u201330 h in salt water and carriers can excrete up to 2 weeks after infection or longer occasionally (Nisar et al. 2014). The seasonality also affects the rate of S. sonnei infection, as probably high in summer and rain, while in tropical climatic regions, it is present throughout the year (Ashkenazi and Cohen 2013). The bacterium virulence genes become activated and expressed at 30\u201337 \u00b0C, in pH 7.433 and mild osmotic pressure (Dorman and Porter 1998). The S. sonnei frequently causes episodes in populated organizations, counting primary schools, military camps (Lee et al. 2003; Wei et al. 2007). Travelling, prison and asylum houses have been significantly attributed to S. sonnei transmission and outbreaks (Baker et al. 2016; Al-Dahmoshi et al. 2020). Muscus domestica (common house fly) is also a major vector in the transmission of S. sonnei infections (Gupta et al. 2012). Moreover, sexual transmission of S. sonnei particularly in gay, bisexual and men sex with men (GBMSM) communities has been reported in Europe, Asia, North America and Oceania (Baker et al. 2015; Mook et al. 2016; Liao et al. 2017).The person-to-person transmission of S. sonnei has also been common in Europe, particularly in England (Morgan et al. 2006; McDonnell et al. 2013; Simms et al. 2015), suggesting S. sonnei as the major health problem causing the burden of gastrointestinal infections (Dallman et al. 2016). Additionally, four distinct chains of S. sonnei infections in United Kingdom (UK) has been identified showing little difference in genetic diversity (Baker et al. 2018a). The HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)-infected patients also serve as a reservoir for the transmission of S. sonnei, as due to the use of antiretroviral therapy parasitic pathogens become more common (Wanyiri et al. 2013). A recent study opened a new dimension of \u2018gender\u2019 to explore the rate of S. sonnei infections. The study suggested a different transmissibility pattern of shigellosis among male and females. The female\u2013male transmission has been found dominant, because females generally carry out more tasks such as cooking in the home. While to children (\u2264 5 years), the route of transmission were elder people (\u2265 60), as grandparents care for children as a custom in China. This highlighted the urgent need of interventions to be applied in females and elder people (Zhao et al. 2020). However, the previous reports also support that the males are more prone to shigellosis and incidence rate is higher than females (Xiao et al. 2014; Chang et al. 2016; Yan et al. 2018). This is supported by a study, indicating that the female sanitary state is more than males (Chompook et al. 2006). But this impact cannot be ignored that the various modes of possible transmission like food, water and inter-personal connection has been interrupted and show relative incidences entirely differently among the different age groups (Hao et al. 2019). In addition, a more recent data on antibiotic-resistant enteric pathogens, suggested investment in WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) measures to tackle the global burden of enteric infections (Shakoor et al. 2019). Shigella sonnei possesses multiple well-established and unique pathogenic mechanisms (Caboni et al. 2015; Mahmoud et al. 2016; Anderson et al. 2017) (see Fig. 1). All the four Shigella species can cause disease in human (Livio et al. 2014). The survival of S. sonnei intracellularly, sabotaging the phagocytic killing and evading of host immune system, particularly inflammatory responses are the fundamental processes of its pathogenesis. For example, inhibition of host pro-inflammatory responses and modulation in the regulation of B-cells and T-cells. These mechanisms and evolving nature of S. sonnei can result in the persistence of infection for longer period (Ashida et al. 2015). Schematic representation of S. sonnei virulence arsenal (Torraca et al. 2020). T3SS host cell invasion, IcsA actin based mortility, T6SS Bacterial competition and niche occupancy, g4c and O antigen resistance to phagocytosis, complement-mediated lysis and phogolysosomal degradtion. l-AltNAc 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-l-altruronic acid, d-FucNAc N-acetyl-2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4-dideoxy-d-fucose Shigella sonnei successful invasion is based on the overcoming of two gut-specific barriers, the gut microbiota and mucus layer (Anderson et al. 2016), as the commensal pathogens competitively act on survival and proliferation. This competitive situation modulates the host immune response, due to the toxins and antimicrobial responses (Baker and The 2018). The invasion plasmid antigen (ipaH) and invasion-associated locus (ial) facilitates the internalization, survival and growth in intestinal cells (Johnson 2017). A study from Vietnam (Thiem et al. 2004), reported the 100% prevalence of ipaH gene in S. sonnei, while it is detected very low from Kenya (Nyanga et al. 2017). These genes are the effectors of T3SS (type 3 secretion system). Interestingly, prior to release, its effector proteins S. sonnei first adhere to host cell diligently, despite in the absence of classical adhesins (Killackey et al. 2016). The recent study showed that the surface protein IcsA (actin polymerizing factor), activated by bile salts, function as an adhesin and play a pivotal role in the attachment to host after the initial activation of T3SS (Brotcke Zumsteg et al. 2014). This novel adhesin advances the pathogenesis pattern and further, the g4C (Group 4C) capsule protects from serum-mediated killing. The g4C capsule is made up of unknown lipid anchor, rather than the known lipopolysaccharides (Caboni et al. 2015). The g4C capsule has high molecular weight and due to its similarity with LPS-Ag, referred as O-Ag capsule (Whitfield 2006). The effector proteins (OspE1 and OspE2), secretion is further promoted by bile salts, that remain intact with the bacterial outer membrane, thus enhances attachment to other polarized cells (Faherty et al. 2012). Moreover, deoxycholate (bile salt), make the final assembly of T3SS in activation-ready state (Stensrud et al. 2008). At the distal tip end of T3SS are components IpaB, IpaC and IpaD. The IpaD assemble the IpaB and IpaC on to the needle, while IpaB and IpaC are hydrophobic proteins in nature and triggers the formation of pore in host cell to deliver effector proteins (Veenendaal et al. 2007).The host membrane cholesterol play a major role in the interaction with IpaB to facilitate and promote the insertion and T3SS activity (Hayward et al. 2005). The T3SS components (IpaB and IpaD), promote binding to filopodia (cytoplasmic projections) and aid in interaction and invasion (Romero et al. 2011). The IpaB function as a molecular plug to block the secretion from T3SS prior to its insertion and removed, while inserted into host membrane (Roehrich et al. 2010). The other T3SS-dependent effector virulence factors include IcsB (inhibit autophagy), IpaA (actin depolymerization) and OpsD3 that has entero-toxic activity (Du et al. 2016). The bacterium reaches its primary target, the colonic epithelium by invading through M cells (microfold) of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), located in the Peyer\u2019s patches of small intestine (Phalipon and Sansonetti 2007). Then, bacteria cause inflammatory colitis (Ashida et al. 2015). Shigella sonnei act against the suppression of inflammation by the host, releasing the effector proteins against MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases) and NF-\u03baB (Nuclear Factors) signaling pathways. In addition, bacterium also inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines, for example, IL-8 (Interleukin-8) epigenetically (Ashida et al. 2011). In a genomic study, the sequencing of S. sonnei strain revealed that the genome (chromosomal and plasmid DNA) of 4,546,505 bp size containing biosynthetic genes of lipopolysaccharide (Deutsch-Nagy et al. 2018). A recent zebrafish model study of S. sonnei infection revealed that S. sonnei O-antigen resist acidification by phagolysosome and enhance neutrophils cell death, hence found to be more virulent than S. flexneri due to its acquired O-antigen oligosaccharides from environmental bacteria Plesiomonas shigelliodes. Additionally, suggesting that the increase of phagolysosomal acidification and frequent innate immune system exposure can decrease S. sonnei by neutrophils (Torraca et al. 2019). There are two distinct unusual sugars are present only on S. sonnei O-Ag (-acetamido-2-deoxy-l-altruronic acid and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-l-fucose) (Liu et al. 2008). Both, lipopolysaccharide, and capsule contain O-Ag, reduce S. sonnei uptake, however, a recent study further thrown light in this dimension saying S. sonnei has adapted its extra-cellular lifestyle and survival mode by developing multiple O-Ag layers on its surface (Watson et al. 2019). Furthermore, S. sonnei also down-regulate the antimicrobial peptides (\u00df-defensin hBD-3) and chemokines such as CCL20 (C\u2013C Motif Chemokine Ligand 20), thus turning dendritic cells into defective state (Al-Dahmoshi et al. 2020). In addition, a large virulence plasmid (pINV) of size 220 kb encodes the proteins that make needle-like macromolecular structure, this enables the transmission of effector proteins from bacterium to host eukaryotic cell directly (Killackey et al. 2016). Type 3 secretion system (T3SS) enables S. sonnei to enter in the host epithelial cells by rupturing its vacuolar membrane, then the bacterium proliferates in cytosol and spread cell-to-cell (Mellouk and Enninga 2016). However, the exact molecular nature and mechanism by which the bacteria rupture vacuolar membrane still demands precise understanding (Carayol and Van Nhieu 2013). In addition to the virulence plasmid, a small region of chromosome \u201cPathogenicity Islands\u201d also contributes to the pathogenesis and virulence. This pathogenic island is present among Shigella spp. and are highly diversified (Yang et al. 2005). A recent study reported the functional type 6 secretion system (T6SS) presence in S. sonnei (encoded by chromosome), that gives S. sonnei an advantage in a niche-specific environment over E. coli, S. flexneri and other closely related species. T66S predominate S. sonnei colonization in host and help it during interbacterial competition (Anderson et al. 2017). Shigella sonnei found to be killing competitors near the surface of colon epithelial cells, thus suggesting T6SS-mediated killing as potential mechanism of uprising its global prevalence. Pyroptotic cell death (highly inflammatory programmed cell death) play a major role in the pathogenesis of S. flexneri (Bergsbaken et al. 2009), that help in escaping the macrophage-mediated killing, inducing local inflammation and evasion of epithelial cells from basolateral side. Likewise, S. sonnei also induces macrophages pyroptosis through caspase 1. Additionally, the internalization of S. sonnei into macrophages is dominantly found to be through phagocytic uptake of macrophages, rather than evasion through T3SS mechanism, as found predominantly in S. flexneri (Watson et al. 2019). Moreover, S. flexneri can activate NLR4C and NLRP3 inflammasomes (multiprotein intracellular complex, that detect pathogens and activate pro-inflammatory response) (Suzuki et al. 2014). It is unclear that S. sonnei releases the same inflammasome or not and to which its benefit, to host or the bacteria itself. Shigella sonnei also possess antibacterial mechanisms. S. sonnei has potential to enable proton consumption system, resist host antimicrobial peptides (Mattock and Blocker 2017), produce colicins (a toxin produces by coliform bacteria) and mucinases (enzymes to degrade mucins) that kills small range of phylogenetically related bacteria, thus making S. sonnei more favourable in the colicin-mucinase sensitive strains. A study from India reported the 93% presence of at least one colicin-coding plasmid, showing its high level of threatening pathogenic trait (Calcuttawala et al. 2015). Another study from Bhutan showed that, all tested strains of S. sonnei carried ColE plasmid, to produce colicins (Ruekit et al. 2014). A different but homologous pic (S. flexneri 2A protein) is also expressed by S. sonnei, belonging to SPATE (Serine, Protease, AutoTransporters of Enterobacteriaceae) family that secrete another protein (SepA). A study suggested that, SepA play role in the destabilization of host intestinal epithelial integrity (Maldonado-Contreras et al. 2017). Recently, first time the completely assembled whole genome of a hybrid pathotype Shiga toxin (Stx) producing S. sonnei has been documented. S. sonnei strain found to be carried Stx1 inducible encoding prophage (genetically S. sonnei do not fabricate Shiga toxin), which further draw attention towards the potentially evolving and emerging virulence capabilities of S. sonnei (Sv\u00e1b et al. 2017). Therefore, there is no ambiguity in the fact that, the global shifting pattern of Shigella infections are multifactorial and depend on several host, environmental, bacterial rapid mutational, and evolutionary mechanisms. However, in the light of above-mentioned virulence and pathogenic mechanisms, it is easy to inference that S. sonnei has become a potential pathogen, increasing its global emergence and burden. After the invasion of colon epithelial cells, S. sonnei cause bloody diarrhoea or \u201cShigellosis\u201d. In response, the host cell releases the pro-inflammatory cytokines (particularly IL-8), and cascades of reaction started at the infection site by recruiting of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), such as neutrophils. These PMNs destroy the gut mucosa lining and thus promote further invasion (Williams and Berkley 2018). There are some other complications, that are resulted in infection due to S. sonnei such as seizures, electrolyte imbalance, leukemoid reactions, intestinal perforation, toxic megacolon, arthralgia, rectal prolapse, while in severe cases sepsis and life-threatening haemolytic\u2013uremic syndrome (HUS) (Ashkenazi 2004; Christopher et al. 2010). Immunocompromised, elderly age group people and young children are more prone to complications, like mucosal ulceration, rectal bleeding, and drastic dehydration (Bliven and Lampel 2017). Reiter\u2019s syndrome (reactive arthritis ReA) can also develop following the infection from S. sonnei (Hannu et al. 2005). The infectious diarrhoea results in the loss of water and electrolyte imbalance, with an abdominal pain, cramping, fever, vomiting; tenesmus (straining during bowel movements), pus and bloody mucoid stools (Nygren et al. 2013). The usual incubation period is 3 days (normally 1\u20137 days) and symptoms last for almost about 1\u20132 weeks (Lampel 2012). In endemic regions, the patients become asymptomatic, developing no infection but shed bacterium in stools for longer duration. The stool culturing and microscopy are the cheap, fast, and easy method to detect the strains of S. sonnei. The PMNs in stools sample can be revealed with the help of methylene blue. The most suitable method to isolate and differentiate S. sonnei is microbiological culturing. The pINV plasmid of S. sonnei is highly unstable when cultured in vitro, hence S. sonnei gives two different appearances when cultured on Congo Red Agar. The small smooth red colonies (retaining plasmid), because of expressing T3SS and O-Ag, while large irregular rough white colonies (loosing plasmid) also formed (Torraca et al. 2020). Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), technique is also available commercially (Kimberlin et al. 2015). The culture-based approaches inherently possess low sensitivity, as the resistance shown by S. sonnei to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and azithromycin has become a serious problem (Tang et al. 2018). The routine-based sequencing methodologies and to afford the respective cost of sequencing-based diagnosis is also among the major constraint for the individual health care facilities and institutes apart from research centres in LMICs (low- and middle-income countries). Therefore, it has become very important to evaluate susceptibility pattern and modify treatment according to the results obtained. Pathogen-specific rapid diagnostic assay are now available to detect O-Ag (Gonzalez and McElvania 2018), however, culture-independent diagnostic tests (CIDTs), also do not detect antimicrobial resistance profile (Fang and Patel 2017). The majority of Shigella infections are self-limited but in severe cases can be fatal if left untreated. Serotype-specific protective immunity can also be developed against O-Ag in the host, automatically over the various exposures (Barnoy et al. 2010). Antimicrobial use is the routine way strategy to limit infection, increase recovery and reducing the transmission. Ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, sulphonamide, and trimethoprim are the common drug of choices against S. sonnei. But, over the span of time, S. sonnei has become resistant to these antimicrobials. In areas, where ampicillin and co-trimoxazole resistant strains are present, the use of fluoroquinolones and azithromycin were advocated (Tribble 2017). Ciprofloxacin and fluoroquinolone had been recommended by WHO for the effective treatment purpose. However, the widespread use of ciprofloxacin and fluoroquinolone has led to emerge the resistance to these antimicrobials also. In late 1990s, ciprofloxacin-resistant S. sonnei emerged, and spread throughout the Asia within just first decade of century (The and Baker 2018). Rifaximin and rifamycin (nonabsorbable) are effective drug of choice in traveller\u2019s diarrhoea (TD), while not helpful in invasive infections. Interestingly, the use of rifamycin potentially reduced the rate of resistance among gut microbiota in comparison to ciprofloxacin treatment (Steffen et al. 2018). Probiotics has been proved to be as a great source of potential to tackle diarrhoea duration (Basu et al. 2009). Interestingly, using guidelines Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii is recommended for therapeutic purpose (Husby et al. 2012). In another study, 16 out 91 tested lactobacilli showed potent antibacterial activity (Zhang et al. 2011, 2012). But probiotic use and severity level differ with host and are not recommended alternatively over antibiotics in severe and moderate diarrhoea, because of the lack in comprehensive knowledge about probiotic-pathogen specificities (Shakoor et al. 2019). The recombinant probiotics targeting the specific pathogens are in developing phase and if come to clinical use, will effectively reduce the pressure of antibiotics (Mathipa and Thantsha 2017). To date, there is no licensed vaccine available against S. sonnei. The inactivated whole cell and subunit vaccines have also been trialled for the prevention against shigellosis (Kaminski and Oaks 2009), a trial of conjugated vaccine S. sonnei-rEPA (Shigella sonnei O-specific polysaccharide bound to Pseudomonas aeruginosa recombinant exoprotein A), one injection found to provide significant immunity against S. sonnei shigellosis (Cohen et al. 1997). An experimental trivalent vaccine has been made containing O-Ag and a pentavalent vaccine also has been proposed, hypothetically that can be effective against majority of shigellosis (Levine et al. 2007). Phage therapy is another pivotal option against shigellosis caused by S. sonnei. Bacteriophages use has several advantages as specificity to bacteria without disturbing the normal microbiota, bactericidal to antibiotic-resistant pathogens, replication at site and self-limiting (Jamal et al. 2015). Nanoparticles (NPs) are also opening a new window to look for more therapeutic options due to their bactericidal activity against the pathogenic bacteria. NPs destroy the structural integrity of cell and generate oxygen free radicals. Copper oxide NPs has recently shown promising approach towards S. sonnei and has been recognized as potential antimicrobial agent (Babaei et al. 2017). Organic acids (citric, acetic, lactic, malic) use also has been regarded as safe by the US Food and Drug administration, as they are antimicrobial and inactivate bacteria. The research showed that the synergistic effect of malic and lactic acid significantly reduced S. sonnei from 4.53 and 3.25 log CFU\/mL, respectively (Zhou et al. 2007). Carvacrol (phenol) and their combinations with organic acids also found to be as potential weapon against S. sonnei. World Health Organization (WHO) first ever published its list of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in 2017 (Tacconelli 2017). Shigella was a priority pathogen among other 12 families of bacteria, that pose significant threat to the public health (Tillotson 2018). The horizontal gene transfer mechanisms and dissemination through mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as resistance plasmids (R-plasmids), integrons, transposon and also the presence of pathogenic islands on chromosomes has risen up the worldwide transmission and emergence of MDR strains of S. sonnei (Ranjbar and Farahani 2019). In a study, improving water supplies and dissemination of MGEs are predicted to be as the major cause of S. sonnei global expansion (Thompson et al. 2015). Plasmids are one of the major importance in the process of horizontal genetic exchange, thus facilitating the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes. S. sonnei like all enteric pathogens has a potential to adapt and survive in the environment, predominantly in aquatic environments, like sewage and wastewater. The inappropriate sanitation then leads to the contamination of irrigated and drinking water. Thus, resulting in the possible transmission and genetic exchange between strains (Byarugaba 2004). For instance, genes of carbapenemase encoding blaNDM-1, extended spectrum beta-lactamase blaCTX-M and currently ongoing challenge of mcr-1(resistance to colistin), has revived the issue of antimicrobial resistance horribly (Cant\u00f3n et al. 2012; Johnson and Woodford 2013; Schwarz and Johnson 2016). Plasmid-mediated transferring of resistance genes (Table \u200b(Table2)2) in S. sonnei has become a common and potential source in the emergence of resistance to antimicrobial regimes (Das and Man"}]}]},{"species":"Serratia marcescens","docs":[{"title":"Serratia marcescens- a rare opportunistic nosocomial pathogen and measures to limit its spread in hospitalized patients","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Serratia marcescens is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"258-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram negative","answer_start":41,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Serratia marcescens?","id":"258-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic","answer_start":26,"id":1},{"text":"opportunistic","answer_start":2418,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Serratia marcescens resistant to?","id":"258-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"beta lactum antibiotics","answer_start":2089,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Serratia marcescens cause?","id":"258-1-1-4","answers":[{"text":"endocarditis and osteomyelitis","answer_start":1453,"id":1},{"text":"Meningitis","answer_start":1306,"id":2},{"text":"nosocomial infections which are mostly confined to the respiratory tract, the urinary tract, surgical wounds and soft tissues","answer_start":1179,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Serratia marcescens is an opportunistic, gram negative, nosocomial pathogen which belongs to family, Enterobacteriaceae. It was discovered by Bizio, an Italian pharmacist, in 1819, when he identified it as a cause of the bloody discolouration on cornmeal mush. He named the organism in honour of the Italian physicist, Serratia who invented the steam boat and marcescens, which is the latin word for \u2018decaying\u2019, as the bloody discolouration on cornmeal disappeared quickly. Serratia marcescens was originally considered to be an innocuous, non pathogenic, saprophytic water organism and it was often used as a biological marker because of its easily recognizable red colonies [1]. Intensive care units are often involved in the epidemics of the colonization and the infection with Serratia marcescens. The important reservoirs in epidemics are the digestive tract, the respiratory tract, the urinary tracts and the perineum of neonates and the artificial nails of adults and health care workers. Medical equipment, lotions, antiseptics, medications, blood products and sinks have also been described as the sources of epidemics. Serratia marcescens accounts for only 1-2% of the nosocomial infections which are mostly confined to the respiratory tract, the urinary tract, surgical wounds and soft tissues. Meningitis, which is caused by Serratia marcescens, has been reported from the paediatrics wards. In persons who are addicted to heroin, it causes endocarditis and osteomyelitis. In urinary tract infections, 30-35% of the patients are asymptomatic and most of the patients have a history of instrumentation. The mortality rate is very high in the nosocomial blood stream infections and in meningitis and endocarditis which are caused by the infection with Serratia. Some strains of Serratia are capable of producing a pigment which is known as prodigiosin, which ranges in colour from dark red to pink, depending on the age of the colonies. An important characteristic of Serratia marcescens is its ability to produce a beta lactamase which confers resistance to the broad spectrum, beta lactum antibiotics, which often complicates the therapy. The main risk factors for bacteraemia\/sepsis which is caused by Serratia is hospitalization, placement of intravenous catheters, intraperitoneal catheters and urinary catheters and prior instrumentation of the respiratory tract [2\u20135]. Serratia marcescens causes both opportunistic and nosocomial infections. The objective of our study was to define the extent of the problem, identify the source and the risk factors and to implement control measures."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Serratia marcescens is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"258-1-2-1","answers":[{"text":"gram negative","answer_start":31,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Serratia marcescens normally exist?","id":"258-1-2-2","answers":[{"text":"environment","answer_start":149,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Serratia marcescens?","id":"258-1-2-3","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic","answer_start":1159,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Serratia marcescens?","id":"258-1-2-4","answers":[{"text":"bacillus","answer_start":45,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Serratia marcescens cause?","id":"258-1-2-5","answers":[{"text":"hospital acquired infections such as urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections and wound infections","answer_start":266,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Serratia marcescens, a motile, gram negative bacillus, which has been classified as a member of the family, Enterobacteriaceae, is widespread in the environment, but it is a rare cause of human disease. The Serratia species are occasionally recognized as a cause of hospital acquired infections such as urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections and wound infections. The major factors that are involved in the development of the Serratia infection include contamination of the respiratory equipment and poor catheterization techniques. Most of the outbreaks have been reported from the paediatrics ward. The crude mortality in the nosocomial blood stream infections which are caused by Serratia is 26%, but in case of the urinary tract infections, the mortality is very low. Moreover, more than 90% of the cases of urinary tract infections are caused by the instrumentation [8,9]. In our study also, the patients developed the infection upon hospitalization and instrumentation (as all the patients had a history of instrumentation, either urinary catheterization or placement of the endotrachael tube for ventilation). This study emphasized the opportunistic nature of Serratia marcescens, as this organism does not cause primary invasive diseases. But it produces an infection when it gains access to a suitable compromised host. The contributory factors for the spread of the hospital acquired infections include inadequate infection control practices which are coupled with the growing range of the modern medical procedures. The present outbreak involved 6 patients; 5 cases were due to cross contamination from the cases of respiratory infections which involved Serratia marcescens. The soap dispenser which was infected with Serratia was removed from the ICU and this probably helped in limiting the spread of the infection. A similar spread of the infection through soap dispensers, which was caused by Serratia marcescens in hospitalized patients as a result of inadequate hand hygiene, has been reported by others also [10,11]. Moreover, the adherence of strict hand hygiene compliance with the use of alcohol based rubs by the health care workers also helped in the containment of the infection. Another study which was done by Mcneal et al., also demonstrated the effectiveness of the alcohol based hand antiseptic, as they were able to remove pathogens from 80% of the health care workers [12]. The usual large number of medical and paramedical staff were in attendance in the ICU and so the exact source of the infection among the health care workers was not identified. Troillet et al., reported imipenem resistance in 11% of the clinical isolates of Serratia species [13]. Another study showed that the Serratia marcescens isolates were sensitive to imipenem, but the resistance to meropenem was high. Thus, their susceptibilities to the antimicrobials may differ in a manner that is dependent on whether these antibiotics were previously used in the units [14]. But in our study, as the organism was highly sensitive to most of the antibiotics, all the cases were successfully treated with imipenem. The isolates were not sent for genotyping, as the spread was controlled\/ limited to a small (six) number of cases, with no recurrence upto 6 months. (no evidence of a further transmission or environmental persistence of Serratia marcescens was seen over a six months period). On the day of the isolation of Serratia marcescens from the ICU , an extensive, environmental, microbiological sampling was done. Swabs were taken from numerous surfaces which included walls, floors, corners, door handles, shelves, sinks, soap dispensers, ventilators, sthethoscopes and other medical devices. Keeping the human carriage possibility in mind, the hands of the health care workers and the auxillary staff were also checked. The bottles of saline which were used for dilution and the soap and disinfectants were either swabbed or cultured. Extensive sanitation procedures were started and glove usage was encouraged among the staff. The water and air filters were routinely serviced and renewed. Sometimes, to limit the spread of the infection, strict measures like nurse cohorting and closure of the ward to new admissions were taken. The practice of the same health care worker assisting in different wards like various ICUs and neonatal wards, also helps in the dissemination of the infection between different wards. Surveillance cultures should be carried out for a minimum of 6 months, as repeat outbreaks of the Serratia infection has been reported [15]. For the future outbreak control measures, every hospital should focus not only on the patients, but also on the mothers of the paediatric patients and the health care workers. The waterless alcohol based antiseptics are more effective than the antimicrobial soaps in eliminating the pathogen from the hands. The introduction of alcohol based handrubs have increased the hand hygiene compliance, as only less time is required for their use. Although genotyping has no role in the therapy, the isolates should be sent for genotyping for epidemiological purposes, if such facilities are available. Molecular assays allow an early aetiological diagnosis which is supported by epidemiological links and this helps in the containment of the spread of Serratia marcescens [16]. But these assays are not available in the small laboratories in a resource constrained country like India and so, other affordable methods like biotyping, bacteriocin typing, resistotyping and serotyping should be explored. This study showed the importance of the hygiene precautions, especially at high risk places like the ICU in a hospital setting."}]}]},{"species":"Solobacterium moorei","docs":[{"title":"A New Look at the Genus Solobacterium: A Retrospective Analysis of Twenty-Seven Cases of Infection Involving S. moorei and a Review of Sequence Databases and the Literature","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Solobacterium moorei is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"259-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-positive","answer_start":37,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can S. moorei cause?","id":"259-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"bloodstream and surgical wound infections","answer_start":288,"id":1},{"text":"halitosis and oral infections","answer_start":186,"id":2},{"text":"intra-abdominal, osteoarticular, and cerebral infections","answer_start":774,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of S. moorei?","id":"259-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":250,"id":1},{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":531,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Solobacterium moorei's requirement for oxygen?","id":"259-1-1-4","answers":[{"text":"anaerobic","answer_start":27,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Solobacterium moorei?","id":"259-1-1-5","answers":[{"text":"bacillus","answer_start":51,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Solobacterium moorei normally exist?","id":"259-1-1-6","answers":[{"text":"oral and the intestinal microbiota","answer_start":79,"id":1},{"text":"vaginal and skin microbiota","answer_start":1376,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Solobacterium moorei is an anaerobic Gram-positive bacillus present within the oral and the intestinal microbiota that has rarely been described in human infections.

The nomenclature of the genus referred to a lone bacterial species (solus for sole, bakterion for small rod). Nowadays, the genus is classified in the family Erysipelotrichaceae within the phylum Firmicutes and, 20 years after its description, still comprises a unique validated species, Solobacterium moorei [1], for which the name Bulleidia moorei had also been proposed but not validated. Three years after its characterization, S. moorei was found to be part of the tongue microbiota species and phylotypes that were significantly associated with halitosis [2], a finding that was later confirmed by Haraszthy et al. [3,4]. The fact that the presence of S. moorei was found to be significantly correlated with organoleptic scores of halitosis, volatile sulfur compound (hydrogen sulfide) levels, and beta-galactosidase activities was further consistent with the hypothesis that this species could be a source of malodorous oral compounds [4]. S. moorei has also been increasingly reported as being associated with other various oral diseases, including different periodontal and endodontic diseases [5,6,7,8]. Apart from being a microorganism present within the oral microbiota, S. moorei has mostly been described as a member of the intestinal microbiota. It has been suggested, based on a metagenomic analysis of the fecal microbiome\u2014which revealed a significant association of several anaerobes, including S. moorei, with colorectal cancer\u2014that this species might be involved in colorectal carcinogenesis [9]. Besides its role in oral infections, S. moorei is considered to be an opportunistic pathogen causing mainly bloodstream and surgical wound infections [10]. However, reported cases of S. moorei infections are still relatively rare, as evidenced by a recent review on this subject by Barrack et al. [10]. Considering the endogenous origin of S. moorei infections, the source of infection is often assumed to be the oral cavity or the intestinal tract. However, this seems not always relevant, suggesting that S. moorei may be present in other endogenous microbiota. The scarcity of data concerning the involvement of S. moorei in human infections led us to carry out a retrospective analysis of 27 cases of infection involving S. moorei and observed in two geographically distant French university hospital centers. To broaden the knowledge on the endogenous reservoirs of S. moorei and the implications of this microorganism for human infections, we also carried out a review of the sequences available in the GenBank database and in metagenomic databases."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whether S. moorei is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"259-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-positive","answer_start":149,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can S. moorei cause?","id":"259-1-3-2","answers":[{"text":"Bloodstream infection","answer_start":4461,"id":1},{"text":"Skin and soft tissue infections","answer_start":6419,"id":2},{"text":"bone infection","answer_start":7894,"id":3},{"text":"bone infection","answer_start":8721,"id":4},{"text":"intracranial abscesses","answer_start":9624,"id":5}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about S. moorei's requirement for oxygen?","id":"259-1-3-3","answers":[{"text":"anaerobic","answer_start":177,"id":1},{"text":"obligatorily anaerobic","answer_start":164,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of S. moorei?","id":"259-1-3-4","answers":[{"text":"bacilli","answer_start":203,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"From 2006 to 2021, a total of 27 S. moorei isolates had been detected in clinical specimens obtained from 27 patients in both centers. Isolates were Gram-positive, obligatorily anaerobic, non-sporulated bacilli that grew on Brucella blood agar supplemented with hemin and vitamin K1 after 2\u20135 days of incubation. Anaerobic Gram-positive bacilli are a heterogeneous group of bacteria, difficult to identify in clinical microbiology laboratories before the era of mass spectrometry. The development of MALDI-TOF technologies has increased the performance in identifying anaerobes but may still be unsuccessful at identifying certain species. Indeed, major differences still exist between databases of currently available mass spectrometry systems, particularly regarding anaerobes. S. moorei is one example of this, being included in the Bruker MS system database (Bruker) [16], whereas it is absent from that of the VITEK MS system (bioM\u00e9rieux) used in our two laboratories. Consequently, all 27 isolates in this study were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, revealing that all of them belonged to the species S. moorei (>99% of sequence identity only with that of S. moorei type strain). S. moorei was identified in 17 male and 10 female patients, with a mean age of 59.5 years (range: 25\u201393 years). This species was mainly identified in mixed aerobic\u2013anaerobic cultures, as observed for numerous cases of infections involving anaerobes (Table 1). Indeed, these infections are mostly endogenous and favored by damaged mucosal\/cutaneous barriers, which allow the penetration of anaerobic species into normally sterile tissues, often together with aerobic\/facultative anaerobic bacteria [17]. This results in infections involving a more or less complex association of various bacterial species, in which deciphering the pathogenic role of each species remains challenging. Isolation of S. moorei as the sole bacterium within a human clinical sample was rarer, representing seven cases in our study, with 6 of the 11 cases of bacteremia (54.5%) and one subcutaneous infection of the ear representing 6.25% of the infections other than bacteremia in our study. Data for the 27 Solobacterium moorei cases with available data included in this study. Antibiotic susceptibility data were available for 24 of the 27 S. moorei isolates (Figure 1). Resistance to \u03b2-lactams and metronidazole was not observed. Resistance to clindamycin (1 of the 23 isolates tested, 4.3%) and to moxifloxacin (2 of the 17 isolates tested, 11.8%) was rarely observed, while 21 of the 23 isolates tested (91.3%) were resistant to rifampicin. With regard to beta-lactams and metronidazole, our data are in agreement with those found in the literature [18,19,20,21,22]. Resistance of S. moorei to fluoroquinolones or clindamycin has not yet been reported, whereas resistance to rifampicin has only been reported by Haraszthy et al. in 2008 for oral isolates [4]. It is noteworthy that isolates that were resistant to moxifloxacin, as well as to rifampicin, were responsible for osteoarticular infections for which fluoroquinolones and rifampicin can be used for treatment. Antimicrobial susceptibility of Solobacterium moorei isolates. The antibiotic molecule is indicated on the left side of the figure, followed by, in brackets, the number of strains with available susceptibility data. * Data for ofloxacin were not included in Figure 1 as they were available for 8 S. moorei strains only: 3 susceptible strains (37.5%), 3 resistant strains (37.5%), and 2 strains with intermediate susceptibility (25%). S. moorei was identified during various infectious processes encompassing bacteremia (n = 11), skin and soft tissue (n = 7), osteoarticular (n = 6), central nervous system (n = 2), and intra-abdominal (n = 1) infections. All of them are presented hereafter successively in comparison with the current literature, with a more detailed description (medical history and treatment) of extremely rare cases or those not described before. Regarding cases not detailed hereafter, most patients had a complex medical history and their clinical conditions required medical and surgical therapy. Medical management most often included broad-spectrum empirical antibiotic treatments subsequently adjusted to the different species identified and their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. These treatments were mostly active on S. moorei regarding the overall susceptibility of the species.  Bloodstream infection is one of the most frequently reported infections due to S. moorei, with 14 cases described so far [10,18,19,22,23]. In our series, S. moorei was identified during bacteremia in 11 of the 27 reported cases. This relatively high occurrence might, at least in part, be related to the fact that special consideration is given to isolates obtained from blood in contrast to those that are part of a polymicrobial anaerobic culture obtained from other clinical samples. The first cases of bacteremia due to S. moorei were reported in 2006 in patients with multiple myeloma and acute proctitis complicating radiotherapy for cervical carcinoma, respectively [18,19]. These two cases underlined the potential diversity of sources for invasive infections due to S. moorei. Indeed, an oral source was suspected based on multiple dentoalveolar abscesses presented by the first patient, whereas, for the second patient, the authors incriminated translocation through the inflamed intestinal mucosa based on the patient\u2019s clinical signs and the initial description of S. moorei in human feces. Since then, bacteremia has been reported in 12 additional patients, 10 of whom were recently reviewed [10,22,23]. Common characteristics were that patients had underlying diseases or risk factors (colon cancer, abdominal surgery, diabetes mellitus, etc.) and the most commonly incriminated portals of entry were oral (poor oral condition, dentoalveolar abscess, etc.) or digestive, despite remaining unknown in some cases as not related to any oral or digestive comorbidity [10,22,23]. In our study, an extensive chart review could only be performed for eight patients. For these patients, the portal of entry was likely to be the oral tract (n = 1), the gastrointestinal tract (n = 3), or the skin (n = 2), while remaining unknown for two patients. Comorbidities such as diabetes and\/or digestive cancer were also identified in five patients (Table 1).  Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) involving S. moorei have been reported in two previous case series [20,22]. Zheng et al. reported nine cases of various SSTIs, including two thigh abscesses, an abdominal wound abscess, an axillary furuncle, two perirectal abscesses, and two pilonidal infections. Although the intestinal origin of the bacterium appeared obvious in some cases, the source of infection remained unknown for others, as in the two cases of thigh abscess and the axilla case furuncle. Whether the bacterium was part of the skin microbiome is still unknown and a potential cutaneous source of infection was not evaluated or discussed. The second study identified S. moorei in various samples related to SSTIs of oral origin: a pus sample from hidradenitis suppurativa of the gluteal region, a purulent discharge from the middle ear, an abscess in the mandibular region, and a total laryngectomy wound [22]. For all these cases, S. moorei was identified as a member of polymicrobial cultures. Two of the cases reported in our study (Table 1) are remarkable compared with the currently available literature: (i) a case of monomicrobial subcutaneous ear collection in a 22-year-old woman presenting a highly painful abscess of the helix, cartilage damage, and ear pavilion chondritis (case no. 14 in Table 1) and (ii) a breast abscess in a 50-year-old woman with no underlying disease or risk factors (case no. 15 in Table 1).  In our study, six patients with bone infection involving S. moorei were found (Table 1). The diagnosis of bone infection was made on the basis of clinical, radiological, and microbiological evidence. For all of these patients, S. moorei was identified from samples (bone biopsies, n = 5; deep collection, n = 1) collected under aseptic surgical conditions. For five of these patients, three of whom had diabetes, these infections resulted mainly from the extension of adjacent SSTI, while, for the remaining patient, who presented a mandibular bone infection, the portal of entry was either the oral cavity or the skin. In this case, infection was favored by sequelae (mucosal lesions, cutaneous fistula, and osteonecrosis) of breast cancer treatment (case no. 19 in Table 1). In the literature, only two case reports of S. moorei isolation associated with a bone infection were found: (i) a case of chronic fistulized osteomyelitis of the tibia for which S. moorei was isolated among a polymicrobial aerobic\u2013anaerobic culture from serous fluid obtained from the fistula, and (ii) a case of a submandibular abscess for which S. moorei was cultured in association with Fusobacterium necrophorum from the abscess pus in a patient with suspected chronic osteomyelitis based on CT scan images [22]. However, in both cases, the implication of S. moorei in the osteomyelitis remained uncertain regarding the sampling conditions and the absence of bone biopsy analysis [22].  To the best of our knowledge, the involvement of S. moorei in central nervous system (CNS) infections has so far not been reported, despite the common oral source of these infections and the presence of S. moorei in the oral cavity during health and diseases. In our case series, two cases of intracranial abscesses caused in part by S. moorei have been observed and have been detailed hereafter, as they represent the first description of the involvement of this species in CNS infections (Table 1). The first case occurred in a 39-year-old man with a chronic breach of the posterior wall of the frontal sinus resulting from a previous ballistic trauma which had received prophylactic treatment including ofloxacin and rifampicin (case no. 25 in Table 1). The patient presented headaches, epileptic seizures, and sepsis. The computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a collection in the frontal area. Microbiological analysis of the abscess pus showed a mixed anaerobic culture, including an S. moorei isolate which was resistant to ofloxacin and rifampicin. The antimicrobial therapy was switched to intravenous cefotaxime, clindamycin, and metronidazole, with a favorable evolution after revision surgery. S. moorei was also identified in a brain tissue sample obtained from a 72-year-old man with headaches, epileptic seizures, and sepsis (case no. 26 in Table 1). The patient had a history of meningioma exeresis with a persistent bone flap infection after craniotomy. CT scanning and magnetic resonance imaging revealed both an intracranial epidural abscess and a frontal brain abscess. Patient management included surgery and meropenem due to associated bacteria, including an extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. A favorable outcome was noted for this patient.  Intra-abdominal infections may represent a possible source of bacteremia, as may be the case for Lee et al.\u2019s case of S. moorei bacteremia associated with acute cholangitis [23]. However, it is noteworthy that, until today, no case of intra-abdominal infection in which S. moorei has been isolated from intra-abdominal samples has been published. Here, we report a case in which S. moorei was directly identified from a necrotic pancreatic collection in a 47-year-old male patient with severe, acute, lithiasic, necrotizing pancreatitis associated with a metabolic disorder (hypertriglyceridemia) (case no. 27 in Table 1). S. moorei was co-isolated with Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus, and Staphylococcus aureus; the patient died despite being treated with piperacillin-tazobactam in addition to surgical debridement (Table 1).  Because sequences deposited in the GenBank database may or may not be associated with published studies, and because sequences originating from metagenomic studies may be associated with published studies not retrieved by using the bacterial name as a keyword for the search unless associated with the main results of the study, we reviewed the sequences present in the database with the aim of obtaining sufficient information about sources of recovery for S. moorei. On 9 March 2021, 938 entries corresponded to the search for \u201cSolobacterium moorei\u201d and 1151 to the search for \u201cSolobacterium\u201d in the NCBI nucleotide database. Most entries corresponded to Whole Genome Sequences, either as scaffold or contig sequences\u2014for example, for strain F024 from the human oral microbiome [24] and strain DSM 22971 (=JCM10645 = RCA59-74), the type strain of S. moorei isolated from human feces [1]. After excluding these entries, a comparison with the BLAST search results allowed us to check the completeness of our search and also to exclude sequences which had been erroneously affiliated to Solobacterium sp. despite being distantly related to this genus. A total of 356 sequences sizing from 155 to 1499 nt and corresponding to strains or uncultured clones affiliated to S. moorei on the basis of sequences displaying \u226598.65% to 100% identity with that of the type strain were analyzed (Supplementary Table S1). An analysis of isolation sources is presented in Figure 2 and shows that 94% of the sequences originated from human sources (n = 336), suggesting that the species is human-associated. Relative distribution of 16S rRNA gene sequences corresponding to S. moorei (\u226598.65% of sequence identity with the type strain) in the NCBI database (n = 356) according to origin. Sequences in the \u201cBlood\u201d (n = 2) and \u201cOther\u201d (n = 2) categories each represent 0.56% of the 356 sequences. Sequences related to the digestive tract represented 33% (n = 110) of the human sequences and originated either from the esophagus (n = 16) or gut\/feces (n = 94). Human gut sequences were identified from stool and mucosal biopsy specimens (duodenal, colon, cecum) in both healthy [25] and diseased subjects with inflammatory bowel diseases, including Crohn\u2019s disease [26,27,28,29] (Supplementary Table S1). Sequences were identified in adults and children and one sequence corresponded to an uncultured Solobacterium sp. clone (clone OTU124\/accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"KJ527533\",\"term_id\":\"627769466\"}}KJ527533) from the stools of preterm infants with extremely low birthweights. The analysis suggested an early implantation of the species in the human gut. Around a quarter of the human sequences originated from the oral cavity (26%, n = 87) (saliva, subgingival plaque), being part of the human oral microbiome in healthy subjects [24,30,31] but also identified in the presence of tooth decay, gingivitis, and periodontitis, including aggressive forms in line with the known implication of S. moorei in oral pathologies [32] (Supplementary Table S1). Probably in relation to the aforementioned presence in the oral cavity, S. moorei sequences were also identified in the respiratory tract (n = 27). This included uncultured clones from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, human lungs, the biofilm of extubated endotracheal tube of ICU patients [33], sputum from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (S. moorei strain C1107\/{\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"JF803577\",\"term_id\":\"332002508\"}}JF803577) [34], sputum samples of patients suffering from hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract infection (Solobacterium sp. uncultured clone V3 DCM-SHRJH\/{\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GU737675\",\"term_id\":\"292385982\"}}GU737675), and pneumonia patients with pulmonary emphysema (uncultured bacterium clones KY51_PHKY51_B01_003 and KY51_PHKY51_D05_007 with accession numbers {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"LC260797.1\",\"term_id\":\"1188259237\"}}LC260797.1 and {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"LC260830.1\",\"term_id\":\"1188259270\"}}LC260830.1, respectively) (Supplementary Table S1). Nevertheless, a pathogenic role of S. moorei in respiratory infection is not currently suspected, although its presence in pathologies well-known for their polymicrobial nature involving pathogenic communities such as CF questions the role of this species in the associated dysbiotic community. S. moorei was also identified in the vaginal microbiome (Solobacterium sp. S4-A19\/{\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"JX104033\",\"term_id\":\"399933139\"}}JX104033) including the vaginal microbiota of HIV-infected African women (13 uncultured clones) [35], as well as in vaginal fluid from subjects with bacterial vaginosis (S. moorei strain DNF00973\/{\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"KU726691\",\"term_id\":\"1005651720\"}}KU726691) (Supplementary Table S1). Likewise, uncultured clones of S. moorei were identified from skin at various locations, including the occiput, antecubital and popliteal fossa, volar forearm, external auditory canal, and nostrils [36,37], as well as from human head and neck tissue samples [38], suggesting that the species may also be part of the human skin microbiota (Supplementary Table S1). Finally, six sequences corresponded to strains involved in wound infections described by Zheng et al. [20]. Only two sequences corresponded to S. moorei strains isolated from blood [18,39] (Supplementary Table S1), confirming that not all sequences are deposited in databases, even for published case reports including 16SrRNA gene sequencing for strain identification. Besides human-associated sequences, only nine sequences corresponded to uncultured clones that may be more or less distantly related to other mammals, including the following origins: milk from cows with mastitis, mouse skin [40], a dairy pasteurizer, and an anaerobic digestion reactor (grey cells in Supplementary Table S1). Other unusual miscellaneous sequences were found in the hemolymph of Crassostrea gigas oysters, ticks, and in fermenting enset (Ensete ventricosum), a kind of banana (orange cells in Supplementary Table S1). Finally, 10 entries corresponded to uncultured S. moorei clones from environmental samples associated with the following sources: soil, soil or post-volcanic pyroclastic surface, volcanic ash at Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull (Island) deposited in 2010, coal seam environments, Holocene marine sediment, river and river biofilms, mangrove leaves, a jet propulsion laboratory (clean rooms where spacecraft are assembled), and indoor air (green cells in Supplementary Table S1). Although our search strategy was limited by the information included in the deposit form associated with the sequence, for which the patient\u2019s designation and clinical status are not systematically specified or cannot be systematically found when published (particularly for large metagenomic studies with huge datasets), it brought new insight into the diversity of sources in which S. moorei can be identified. The analysis particularly revealed its presence in human vaginal and skin samples and showed us that the species was mainly human-associated.  The presence of 16S rRNA gene sequences displaying close identity to that of the S. moorei type strain was found in 55 types of metagenomes for which associated information was available, albeit imprecise for some of them. The analysis was split into human-associated metagenomes (based on \u201chuman\u201d or \u201cHomo sapiens\u201d in the designation of the metagenome) and non-human-associated metagenomes. The presence of S. moorei-related sequences was overwhelmingly observed in human-associated metagenomes, confirming observations drawn from the analysis of individual NCBI sequences. Regarding anatomical sites, metagenomes that most often contained S. moorei sequences were of tracheal and oral origin, with 17.3% and 16.4% of positive samples, respectively (Figure 3). Together with S. moorei detection in nasal\/pharyngeal metagenomes, this makes the upper digestive and respiratory tracts by far the sites most commonly inhabited by S. moorei. By comparison, the presence of S. moorei is at least three times less frequently observed in gut metagenomes (5.2% of positive samples) whereas skin metagenomes more often hosted S. moorei (7.5% of positive samples) than gut metagenomes. Finally, vaginal and human reproductive system metagenomes also contain S. moorei but more rarely than other human metagenomes. S. moorei detection in different human metagenomes. Altogether, S. moorei was found to be present in a wider panel of human metagenomes than initially thought from its original description in feces samples and well-known presence in the oral cavity. Regarding the relative abundance of S. moorei sequences in human metagenomes, S. moorei hits mostly represented rare sequences below 0.1% of the total sequences in 68.8% of positive samples. An abundance of over 1% of total sequences was observed in 3.7% of samples and an intermediate abundance (0.1\u20131%) in 27.5% of samples (Figure 4). However, variability was observed according to the metagenome considered, with an overall higher abundance of S. moorei sequences in samples from the upper digestive and respiratory tracts and the lung (Figure 4).

The type of human metagenome is indicated on the left side of the figure, followed by, in brackets, the number of samples considered in the analysis for each type of metagenome. SRA: sequence read archive. The type of human metagenome is indicated, followed by, in brackets, the number of sequence read archive (SRA)-derived samples considered in the analysis. Color coding indicates the relative abundance of S. moorei-related sequences. These different observations may support the frequent identification of an oral source or the implication of a digestive source for infection in patients with infectious processes involving S. moorei, as detailed in Section 3.1, but also confirm that other human microbiota may also be suspected in certain cases unrelated to any oral or digestive comorbidity. Skin and the reproductive tract are shown to represent alternate portals of entry for S. moorei that may have been considered in previous cases of S. moorei infection in patients with intravenous drug abuse [21,41] or cervical cancer [19]. In our study, S. moorei may have originated from the skin microbiota in at least two cases (subcutaneous ear collection and bacteremia in a 52-year-old patient with diabetes and a recent toe amputation). In contrast to human metagenomes, S. moorei was occasionally identified in various non-human metagenomes, of either animal, environmental, or other origin (Table 2). Non-human metagenomes containing S. moorei sequences. A sample corresponds to an SRA (sequence read archive)-derived sample; a positive sample corresponds to a sample in which at least one sequence corresponding to S. moorei (sequence identity threshold: 99%) was detected (all abundances). The numbers of samples with relative abundance of S. moorei-related sequences >0.1% and >1% are given according to the type of metagenome. -: no sample in this category. Bold type indicates atypical, biased observations further discussed in the text. This low representation of S. moorei-related sequences in non-human metagenomes ties in with the rare, non-human sequences demonstrated in the first part of sequence database analysis of this study and previously shown in Figure 2 with a roughly similar, non-human source distribution (animal, environment, others). However, although all previous results suggested that S. moorei was a human-associated species, atypical observations were made during the metagenome database analysis for pig gut and invertebrate gut metagenomes. These results were therefore more thoroughly analyzed, showing that they should be considered with caution as they probably result from the following biases: invertebrate gut metagenome data originated from very few samples (n = 32) resulting from a single study of gut metagenomes in the leech, Hirudo nipponica, revealing three S. moorei-positive samples. Similarly, 322 of the 325 positive samples from the pig gut metagenome (sequence read archive accession numbers comprised between ERR2739626 and ERR2740414) originated from a single study performing a longitudinal assessment of the gut microbiome in piglets from birth up to weaning. Considering that positive samples originated from single studies and, probably, from non-independent samples in both cases, these potentially biased results are not considered further and S. moorei is still considered a human-associated species."},{"qas":[{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of S. moorei?","id":"259-1-4-1","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":795,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about S. moorei's requirement for oxygen?","id":"259-1-4-2","answers":[{"text":"anaerobic","answer_start":785,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does S. moorei normally exist?","id":"259-1-4-3","answers":[{"text":"vaginal and skin microbiota","answer_start":1113,"id":1},{"text":"oral, lung, and gut microbiota","answer_start":1019,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Taking S. moorei as an example, lessons from the GenBank and metagenome databases\u2019 screening are in favor of their usefulness for complementing commonly performed reviews of the literature.

While mostly present in the oral, lung, and gut microbiota, its distribution among the human microbiota also includes the vaginal and skin microbiota, which may be other sources of infection. As it comes from various microbiota, S. moorei is mainly involved in polymicrobial infections where its pathogenic role often remains to be established and where the species is thought to interact with other bacteria.

Eubacterium includes all anaerobic, non-spore-forming, Gram-positive bacilli except Propionibacterium, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. The main glucose fermentation product for S.moorei is acetic acid, whilst for Propionibacterium, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium, it is propionic acid, lactic acid, acetic acid, both butyric acids and formic acid [1]. Due to differences in culture conditions, G + C contents and fermentation products, S.moorei was assigned to a new species. In the last decade, S. moorei has mainly been reported to cause oral diseases, including halitosis [3\u20135], endodontic infections [6, 7], peri-radicular lesions [8], refractory periodontitis [9], root canals [7], periodontal disease and dentoalveolar abscesses [2]. Studies show that S.moorei mainly colonizes the oral cavity of halitosis patients, with detection frequency in healthy volunteers much less than in halitosis patients. The distribution of S.moorei varies by race and gender, being more prevalent in African Americans, followed by Hispanics and Whites, and in males than females [3\u20135]. S.moorei adheres to oral epithelial cells through adhesins. Biofilm formation is a key step in the development of halitosis [17]. Furthermore, S.moorei produces beta galactosidase and hydrogen sulfide, which play important roles in halitosis [4]. In addition to oral diseases, S.moorei is reported to cause wound and blood stream infections, although this is relatively rare. To date, there are only four reports about S.moorei bacteremia [11\u201314], and one report on wound infection [10]. Table 2 summarizes S. moorei bacteremia and wound infections. Including the present case, there are only 9 cases of S. moorei bacteremia; 5 cases of S. moorei bacteremia were reported by Pedersen during a period of 7 years [14]. S. moorei deposited in the clone library was isolated from only 9 cases in a pool of 400 surgical wound infections. Clinical data indicates that patients with compromised immunity (such as malignant disease, intravenous drug abuser, diabetes and history of surgery) are more susceptible to S.moorei bacteremia across gender and age. S.moorei is susceptible to commonly used anti-anaerobic agents (e.g., penicillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, clindamycin, metronidazole, meropenem, moxifloxacin, tegacycline and vancomycin). For wound infections, surgical debridement and drainage is commonly required. In the present case, the high fever developed during treatment may be related to the entry of S.moorei and Streptococcus mitis into the bloodstream. After replacement of venous pipeline and empirical use of vancomycin and meropenem, the patient\u2019s body temperature and the total leukocyte count returned back to normal.  Review of published S. moorei literatureand one case from our hospital over the past 12 years Summary of the nine cases of Solobacterium moorei bacteremia and nine cases of wound infection reported in literature S.moorei bloodstream infection may originate from oral infection, lung abscess, abdominal infection, and the habit of licking needle by intravenous drug users. The patient in this case had serious halitosis, which maybe the origin of the bacteremia. However, we failed to culture this pathogen from oral secretions, possibly due to the fact that oral secretions are not routinely cultured for anaerobic pathogens. Thus for patients with oral diseases such as halitosis, anaerobic cultures should be strongly recommended to identify suspicious pathogens. The newly discovered S. moorei was isolated from patients with oral diseases and immune deficiency. Although rarely isolated, its pathogenicity in oral, wound and bloodstream infections is very clear. S. moorei exhibits susceptibility to common antibiotics used for anaerobic infections. Prior use of antibiotics before blood cultures are taken may yield negative results. Due to the special culture conditions and specialized identification method, the prevalence of S. moorei bacteremia may be underestimated. Laboratory staff and clinicians should pay more attention to such rare bacteria and their clinical significance. Optimization of blood culture procedures and utilization of 16S rRNA gene sequencing are powerful tools for rare pathogen identification from blood and other sterile body fluids."}]}]},{"species":"Bacillus coagulans","docs":[{"title":"Potential Use of Bacillus coagulans in the Food Industry","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether B. coagulans is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"260-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-positive","answer_start":3713,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of B. coagulans?","id":"260-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"nonpathogenic","answer_start":3751,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about B. coagulans's requirement for oxygen?","id":"260-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"facultative anaerobic","answer_start":3728,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Nowadays, the interest in probiotic foods is increasing due to the growing consumer demand for safe and functional foods with health-promoting properties and high nutritional value [1]. Probiotics are defined as \u201clive microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host\u201d [2]. In order to obtain benefits, probiotic products should contain at least 10\u201310 cfu\/g probiotic microorganism and should survive until the end of shelf life [3]. Probiotic microorganisms, which are naturally found in intestinal microbiota, could protect humans from diseases, modulate and strengthen the immune system, prevent tooth decay, have anticarcinogenic properties, and be effective against coronary heart disease [4,5]. Probiotic microorganisms can produce organic acids (such as lactic and acetic acid), hydrogen peroxide, and bacteriocin [5]. Probiotics have several mechanisms to inhibit pathogen microorganisms. The primary mechanisms are as follows: (1) the lowering of the pH of food through lactic acid production; (2) the production of antimicrobial substances such as microcin, hydrogen peroxide, and compounds like free radicals; (3) competition for food resources by attaching to receptors; and (4) stimulation of the production of secretory IgA (Immunoglobulin A) by the formation of protective mucin (parent substance of the mucus composed of tissue of epithelial or connective origin and a mixture of glycoprotein and mucoprotein) [5].  There are two basic forms of probiotic microorganisms used in foods: the vegetative form and the spore form. The vegetative form is more susceptible to high temperatures, moisture, acidity, shelf life of food, and negative environmental conditions during the manufacture of food than the spore form. However, some probiotic microorganisms do not have spore forms [4]. Fermentation conditions, freezing, thawing, drying, cell protection additives, rehydration of dried probiotics, and microencapsulation applications are factors that affect the survival of probiotic microorganisms during probiotic food production. Food compounds, food additives, oxygen content, redox potential, moisture content\/water activity, storage temperature, pH and titration acidity, and packaging conditions are factors that also affect survival of probiotic microorganisms during storage [6]. Gastrointestinal system conditions and stress factors could cause significant loss of viable probiotic cells [7].  Lactic acid bacteria (LAB; for example, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and some Saccharomyces species) are the microorganisms most commonly used in probiotic food production [8,9,10,11]. However, these microorganisms cannot survive heat treatment, for which the cold spot temperature is approximately 75 \u00b0C [8,10]. Heat treatment is not applicable for most probiotic foods that contain commercial probiotic microorganisms due to their sensitivity to heat. Nevertheless, it has been stated that this restriction could be overcome by the usage of spore-forming probiotic microorganisms. It is known that some non-pathogenic Bacillus species, which are not as well-known as LAB and yeasts, are being used as probiotics [12]. The survival and stability of these bacteria have considerably improved compared to others through their spore-forming abilities. They are identified as an ideal choice in order to development of functional foods by protecting their vitality in high-temperature applications [13,14]. Bacillus coagulans (B. coagulans) was firstly isolated from spoiled milk [6]. In 1933, it was identified as Lactobacillus sporogenes by Horowitz-Wlassowa and Nowotelnow. Afterwards, it was classified as B. coagulans [15]. B. coagulans is a gram-positive, facultative anaerobic, nonpathogenic, spore-forming, lactic acid-producing bacteria [4]. It is resistant to heat; the optimum growth temperature for B. coagulans is 35 to 50 \u00b0C and the optimum growth pH is 5.5 to 6.5 [4,15]. It has the characteristics of microorganisms used as probiotics [15]. Some strains of B. coagulans have been reported as facultative anaerobe, thermophile bacteria able to grow at pH 6.2, 60\u201365 \u00b0C [6,16]. Although B. coagulans produces acid, it does not produce gas from maltose, raffinose, mannitol, and sucrose fermentation. It was reported that B. coagulans causes deterioration in dairy, fruit, and vegetable products due to acid production. In addition to lactic acid production, some strains also produce thermostable \u03b1-amylase [4,17]. For this reason, B. coagulans is important from an industrial point of view. B. coagulans spores are terminal, while spores of other species are central or subterminal. Furthermore, it differs from other Bacillus species due to the absence of cytochrome-C oxidase, and it does not reduce nitrate to nitrite [4]. It was reported that B. coagulans could grow at pH 4.5 at 65 \u00b0C and was isolated from products containing milk and carbohydrate [18].

No growth was observed with acetate, citrate, gluconate, inositol, malate or mannitol as carbon sources. The strain showed very weak catalase activity. HPLC analysis of menaquinones revealed two peaks: the main peak corresponded with MK-9(H4) and the smaller one with MK-8(H4). The major fatty acid found was anteiso-C15:0 (12-methyl tetradecanoic acid). Mycolic acids were absent. The polar lipids detected were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol mannosides. Peptidoglycan type was A4alpha, L-Lys-D-Asp. The cell-wall sugars detected were galactose and rhamnose. The complete 16S rDNA sequence of strain XIL07T was obtained and phylogenetic analysis based on the neighbour-joining method indicated that this bacterium belongs to the high-G + C-content Gram-positive bacteria and that the closest related genera are Promicromonospora and Cellulosimicrobium. The DNA G + C content was 73 mol%. According to the data obtained in this work, this bacterium belongs to a new genus in the family Promicromonosporaceae and the name Xylanimonas cellulosilytica gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is strain XIL07T (=LMG 20990T =CECT 5975T).

This pathogen transmits via the oral-fecal route as a highly contagious and resilient spore. Upon exposure to primary bile acids in the intestine, C. difficile germinates, and in the absence of colonization resistance from the normal microbiota, the bacterium colonizes the colon and produces toxins. These toxins inhibit actin polymerization in host cells, leading to cell death. C. difficile cells can then sporulate in the intestine and exit the body via diarrheal shedding.

[6]). M. fujisawaense was proposed as a new species in 1988 (as discussed by Green et al. [4]); so far neither it has been reported as a human pathogen nor it has been isolated from clinical specimens. In contrast, M. mesophilicum has been isolated from blood, bone marrow, skin, sputum, pleural effusion, and dyalisate of patients with clinically suspected infection (as discussed by Sanders et al. [3]). Scanty information concerning M. fujisawaense reports its isolation from tap water and its susceptibility to imipenem and tetracycline only, (as discussed by Furuhata et al. [1]) whereas most Methylobacterium species are sensitive even to aminoglycosides, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and cotrimoxazole (as discussed by Brown et al. [7]). Discordant carbapenem susceptibility, with sensitivity to imipenem and resistance to meropenem, seems to be a distinctive feature of Methylobacterium species (as discussed by Zaharatos et al. [5]). We report here, for the first time, the isolation of a M. fujisawaense strain from blood cultures during a febrile episode in an immunocompromised patient undergoing HSCT after relapsing AML. As our patient was previously infected by a multiresistant P. aeruginosa strain likely causing pulmonary infiltrates with necrotizing lesions, the role of this microorganism remains unclear. The fastidious growth of M. fujisawaense may well explain the lack of previous clinical reports. In this case, it was fortuitously detected in multiple mycobacterial blood cultures. Indeed, M. fujisawaense was able to grow in the radiometric broth specific for mycobacteria, and its detection was made possible by the longer incubation of mycobacterial blood cultures in comparison with the routine ones. Clinical interpretation of microbiological tests can be sometimes problematic, and conclusions should be drawn with prudence. However, the fact that M. fujisawaense was isolated from multiple blood samples, collected from both peripheral vein and CVC, suggests the presence of a systemic infection caused by this organism and excludes the hypothesis of contamination or colonization in our ward; moreover, laboratory contamination was very improbable, as blood transfer from the collection tube to the culture bottle by a sterile syringe and under laminar flow cabinet was the only operation carried out in the laboratory. After catheter removal, M. fujisawaense was no longer found in blood cultures, even if the patient was never treated with imipenem. Actually as CVC is the most common portal of Methylobacterium infection, most experts recommend catheter removal, as part of treatment along with appropriate antibiotic regimens (as discussed by Sanders et al. [3] and Fernandez et al. [8]). Although rare, infections with Methylobacterium species are now reported\u2014particularly in immunocompromised patients\u2014because of the improvement of identification methods. Isolation of those unusual pathogens should not be disregarded by microbiologists, their potentially infectious role should not be denied by clinicians, and all possible sources should be investigated. The availability of molecular tools is crucial to correctly identify rare microorganisms and contribute to the emergence of previously unrecognized diseases."}]}]},{"species":"Methylobacterium phyllosphaerae","docs":[{"title":"Methylobacterium phyllosphaerae sp. nov., a pink-pigmented, facultative methylotroph from the phyllosphere of rice","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"How about Methylobacterium phyllosphaerae's requirement for oxygen?","id":"274-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"aerobic","answer_start":19,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" A pink-pigmented, aerobic, facultatively methylotrophic bacterial strain, CBMB27T, isolated from leaf tissues of rice (Oryza sativa L.

The most common clinical manifestations of spinal infection are fever, back or neck pain, even radiating to the lower limbs, and inguinal hernia, with different manifestations occurring depending on the site of infection[4]; approximately 30% of patients present with neurological symptoms, including sensory abnormalities and muscle weakness[5]. In contrast, 75-95% of patients, during physical examinations, can feel paravertebral muscle spasms, while there is significant pressure pain on percussion over the spinous process of the infected spinal segment[4]. The most frequently involved spinal segments are the lumbar (58%), thoracic (30%), and cervical (11%) spine[6]. The spinal segment involved in this case was the lumbar spine. There are three main routes of spinal infection: (1) Haematogenous infection; (2) direct inoculation infection of adjacent tissues; and (3) postoperative infection[4], which can extend posteriorly and lead to epidural or subdural abscesses and even meningitis, while lateral dissemination can lead to abscesses of the psoas major, retroperitoneum, sub-diaphragm, paravertebral space, retropharynx, and mediastinum[7]. The most common pathogens causing spinal infections are bacteria, fungi and, less commonly, parasites; the most common pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus[8-10], followed by Streptococcus and Enterococcus, while infections caused by M. tuberculosis are significantly less common[11]. In the Mediterranean and the Middle East, Brucella can also lead to spinal infections[12], and in endemic areas, such as countries with warm climates (e.g., South America, Central Asia, and Africa), spinal tapeworm infections can also be seen occasionally[13], but a definite source cannot be identified in nearly 50% of spinal infections[14]. In the present case, the patient was admitted with low back pain, recent night sweats, weight loss, and fever on admission. Lumbar spine MRI suggested lumbar spine tuberculosis with peripheral cold abscess formation, and there was no further fever after anti-tuberculosis treatment was administered. In China, especially in developing regions, there are more cases of M. tuberculosis causing spinal tuberculosis, thus leading to paravertebral abscesses or lumbar major abscesses[15]. Initially, we misdiagnosed this case as lumbar spine infection due to M. tuberculosis, but the tuberculosis antibody test, the smear for the detection of acid-fast bacilli, the pathological molecular biology test, the negative M. tuberculosis \u03d2 interferon release test, the negative M. tuberculosis drug resistance gene, and the negative M. tuberculosis biochip results did not support the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection. Finally, M. paragordonae infection was determined by a macrogenomic test. At present, the diagnosis of spinal infections mainly relies on routine blood tests, infection indicators, the culture of pus secretions, and pathological findings, and imaging modalities mainly include X-rays, MRI, and CT, wherein MRI is the optimal option for the diagnosis of spinal infections and can determine the size and extent of abscesses. Definitive diagnosis still relies on pathological findings and culture of pus secretions[7]. Therefore, it is particularly important to culture specimens from patients with lumbar spine infection combined with paravertebral abscesses in a timely manner, and metagenomic next-generation sequencing plays a role in detecting unknown pathogens of lumbar spine infections. In recent years, mycobacterial infections have been increasing annually both in China and abroad, and the incidence of nontuberculous mycobacteria, types of mycobacteria other than M. tuberculosis, has increased to approximately 39.6 cases per 100000 people per year in the Asian population[16]. Some nontuberculous mycobacteria have a high similarity to M. tuberculosis in lung or extra-pulmonary infections (spine, lymph nodes, intestine, etc.), which can be easily missed or misdiagnosed. Nontuberculous mycobacteria are prevalent in the environment and multiply in soil and water, and it is important to consider nontuberculous mycobacteria when considering M. tuberculosis infections of the lumbar spine. The treatment for spinal infections includes non-surgical and surgical treatments, and non-surgical treatment often involves absolute bed rest, rational and standardized application of antibiotics, and symptomatic supportive treatment, but the treatment period is often long. Commonly used empirical antibiotic regimens include vancomycin and third-generation cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, but the presence of spinal abscesses and spinal cord or nerve root compression with progressive neurological dysfunction can result in the failure of conservative treatment, leading to the recommendation of surgical treatment[17]. In this case, the patient had already developed vertebral destruction and paravertebral abscesses and was therefore treated medically and surgically. Specimens of necrotic tissue from the lumbar spine of this patient were sent for metagenomic next-generation sequencing, and M. paragordonae was found. This species is a slow-growing, rare non-tuberculous member of the genus Mycobacterium. Its unique 16S rRNA gene sequence is approximately 99% similar to that of Gordon's Mycobacterium. Generally, M. paragordonae is rod-shaped and acid-resistant, with no spores or mycelium under the microscope, and with an optimal growth temperature of 25-30 \u00baC[1]. M. paragordonae is generally not pathogenic or is weakly pathogenic, and there was concern that the isolated organism may have been contaminated or colonized; however, the specimen from this patient was a lumbar spine surgery specimen, with no contamination or colonization, and the number of reads detected by metagenomic next-generation sequencing was 11563, with a coverage of 8.559%. Given this information, along with the clinical symptoms of the patient, M. paragordonae was considered to be the cause of infection in this patient. Few cases have been reported on the pathogenicity of M. paragordonae. Cheung et al[18] reported the first case of M. paragordonae peritonitis in a 55-year-old man who received continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for 2 years. In contrast, there are no reports on cases of M. paragordonae causing lumbar spine infections. Because of its temperature sensitivity and its ability to produce strong immune responses to M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium abscesses in inoculated mice, Kim et al reported that M. paragordonae could be used as a potential live vaccine against Mycobacterium[2], and Lee et al reported that this inactivated strain may be used as a potential immunotherapeutic adjuvant to increase the effectiveness of cancer chemotherapy[19]. The diagnosis and treatment of M. paragordonae are not well documented, although Cheung et al[18] reported a treatment plan for cases of peritonitis due to M. paragordonae based mainly on tissue culture drug sensitivity results. Since no pathogen was detected in the pus culture of this patient and M. paragordonae is a nontuberculous mycobacterium, we treated the patient with appropriate medication according to our experience with nontuberculous mycobacteria. Because of the destruction of the vertebral body and paravertebral abscesses, this patient was treated by surgery. The patient achieved a good outcome, but further follow-up is still required for the treatment of similar patients. Next-generation sequencing technology, such as metagenomic next-generation sequencing, allows thousands to billions of DNA fragments to be sequenced independently and simultaneously and is now a widely used technique in microbial testing. Because almost all pathogens contain DNA or RNA genomes, metagenomic next-generation sequencing of unidentified pathogens is now becoming an important test for definitive diagnosis[20,21]. As demonstrated by this case, such rare and slow-growing pathogens are easily overlooked by ordinary bacterial culture methods due to their slow growth; therefore, metagenomic next-generation sequencing can be an important test for clinical diagnosis in addition to prolonging the culture time."}]}]},{"species":"Mycolicibacterium fortuitum","docs":[{"title":"Pulmonary infection due to fluoroquinolone-resistant Mycolicibacterium fortuitum: a case report","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Mycolicibacterium fortuitum cause?","id":"276-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"pulmonary infection","answer_start":92,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Mycolicibacterium fortuitum resistant to?","id":"276-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"fluoroquinolone","answer_start":305,"id":1},{"text":"fluoroquinolone","answer_start":1051,"id":2},{"text":"fluoroquinolones","answer_start":1301,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Mycolicibacterium fortuitum is a species of the rapidly growing mycobacteria that can cause pulmonary infection.

They can affect many organs and cause diseases, such as pulmonary disease, lymphadenitis, cutaneous disease, and disseminated disease [2]. Of these, pulmonary infection is the most common clinical manifestation [2]. The most common pathogens for lung disease are Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacteroides abscessus, but Mycolicibacterium fortuitum is also important [3]. M. fortuitum is one of the rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM), which is the categorization according to colony morphology and growth characteristics [2]. One characteristic of M. fortuitum is to show favorable susceptibility and clinical effect of multiple antibiotics [4]. The 2007 official American Thoracic Society (ATS)\/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) statement showed that M. fortuitum isolates were susceptible to amikacin (100%), ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (100%), sulfonamides (100%), cefoxitin (50%), imipenem (100%), clarithromycin (80%), and doxycycline (50%) [4]. Several previous cases have reported that combining antibiotics, including quinolones, successfully completed the treatment [5, 6]. There is no report about the treatment of resistant M. fortuitum. Quinolones act by inhibiting the bacterial topoisomerases DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV [7]. The most common mechanism of quinolone resistance in mycobacteria is due to mutations in the gyrA and gryB genes of DNA gyrase [7]. These mutations involved a conserved region called the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) [7]. However, there have been no reports on M. fortuitum and its mechanism of resistance. We describe a rare case of pulmonary disease due to fluoroquinolone-resistant M. fortuitum. In addition, we investigate the mechanism of resistance of M. fortuitum."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can M. fortuitum cause?","id":"276-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"pulmonary disease","answer_start":352,"id":1},{"text":"localized infections of the skin, bone, and soft tissue disease","answer_start":277,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Mycolicibacterium fortuitum resistant to?","id":"276-1-3-2","answers":[{"text":"fluoroquinolone","answer_start":72,"id":1},{"text":"fluoroquinolone","answer_start":6252,"id":2},{"text":"fluoroquinolones","answer_start":2231,"id":3},{"text":"fluoroquinolones","answer_start":6395,"id":4}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the treatment of fluoroquinolone-resistant M. fortuitum and identify the mechanism. M. fortuitum is one of RGM [4], commonly seen as an infection through whirlpool footbaths in nail salons [11\u201314]. It most commonly causes localized infections of the skin, bone, and soft tissue disease [4]. While pulmonary disease due to M. fortuitum is relatively rare [3], some risk factors have been reported. Related structural lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis, neoplasms, immunosuppressant use, and environmental exposure are known to be risk factors in other NTM-related pulmonary diseases [15]. Gastrointestinal disturbance with chronic vomiting is also a characteristic predisposing factor for M. fortuitum [4]. Our patient had many risk factors including current use of an immunosuppressant, previously treated neoplasms, and having a gastrointestinal disorder secondary to a total gastrectomy. Treatment of NTM is based on their unique susceptibility patterns and sensitivities to antibiotics [4]. M. fortuitum is one of the most susceptible groups in vitro, which closely corresponds to the clinical effect. Therefore, using at least two antibiotics based on susceptibility test is recommended and the duration of treatment should be given for at least 12 months after negative sputum culture is obtained [4]. Any two-drug combination with in vitro susceptibility should be successful [4]. In particular, resistance to fluoroquinolones is quite rare [16\u201319]; therefore, fluoroquinolones are recommended as a treatment option for M. fortuitum [16]. Since it is rare to acquire resistance in M. fortuitum, there is no report on treating it. In our case, the result of susceptibility test in vitro even after acquiring resistance was also parallel to those of clinical effect. The antibiotics which showed high MIC became clinically ineffective. Moreover, treatment with amikacin and imipenem\/cilastatin succeeded, as susceptibility test indicated. Therefore, we suggest that susceptibility test is still a valid metric to choose antibiotics in patients who have been previously treated. As far as we know, the mechanism of resistance to fluoroquinolones in M. fortuitum has never been reported. Quinolones inhibit both bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV in other bacteria, whereas DNA gyrase is the only target in mycobacteria [7]. This enzyme is a tetrameric protein composed of two A and two B subunits, carrying gyrA and gyrB gene products respectively [7]. One mechanism of resistance is associated with a difference in the structures of subunits, including only a single amino acid change in these genes [20]. Several amino acids are reported to be related to quinolone resistance, which commonly localizes in the limited regions, called the QRDR [20]. Using in the numbering system used for Escherichia coli, the residue at position 83 in the QRDR GyrA plays an important role [20]. Although most quinolone-resistant species such as M. abscessus or M. avium have an alanine residue at position 83 in GyrA, wild-type M. fortuitum GyrA has a serine which is the same structure as quinolone-susceptible bacteria such as E. coli and Neisseria gonorrhoeae [7]. In our case, a strain before antibiotic treatment had a serine residue at position 83 in the A subunit of DNA gyrase, as same as wild-type M. fortuitum. However, after treatment with clarithromycin and levofloxacin, a serine was substituted by a tryptophan. We hypothesize that the conversion of a small polar amino acid to a large hydrophobic residue leads to quinolone resistance in this case. This hypothesis is supported by an analysis of E. coli GyrA, which showed that this change can cause quinolone resistance [21]. Unfortunately, in our case, it was difficult to accurately distinguish between recurrence due to acquisition of quinolone resistance and reinfection of quinolone-resistant strain because no molecular typing tests were performed. However, the infection was suspected to have recurred because it worsened just 1 month after the antibiotics were discontinued. Although a certain breakpoint has not been established for sitafloxacin, M. fortuitum was reported to have low MIC to sitafloxacin [16]. Recent studies showed that ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin-resistant strains with GyrA mutations remain low MIC to sitafloxacin in N. gonorrhoeae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and M. avium complex [22\u201324]. Whereas study in Helicobacter pylori infection after unsuccessful eradication with sitafloxacin-containing regimens showed that sitafloxacin might lead to the accumulation of double mutations in GyrA, which would provide resistance to sitafloxacin in Helicobacter pylori [25]. The present case also showed low MIC to sitafloxacin in strains with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin-resistance (Table 1). Further study is needed for the investigation of that mechanism and clinical efficacy of sitafloxacin, as it could be a candidate as a suitable option because a variety of oral treatment for RGM is limited. The official statement by ATS\/IDSA in 2007 recommended that clarithromycin for RGM should be used with caution [4]. It is mainly because of the presence of the erythromycin-inducible methylase (erm) gene, which methylates the 23S ribosomal RNA macrolide-binding site, well-known as a common cause of inducible resistance to macrolides [26]. Some RGM species have their own intrinsic erm gene, such as the erm (39) genes of M. fortuitum or the erm (41) genes of M. abscessus. Due to the erm gene, isolates became resistant to clarithromycin with 14 days of incubation, although these showed the susceptible MICs at 3 days of incubation [27]. Our case showed susceptibility at day 3, but resistance at day 14 to clarithromycin (Table 1). Because of limited choices of oral antibiotics and the potency of these combinations of antibiotics, we did not discontinue clarithromycin. Although how to use clarithromycin for RGM is still controversial, further studies are required to evaluate the effect of combination therapy to increase options for the treatment of RGM.

Although it has been reported as one of treatable species in mycobacterium, it can become resistant to fluoroquinolones. Susceptibility test is still effective over second-line treatment.

The major taxa are the Mycobacterium fortuitum group, M. chelonae\/M. abscessus complex, M. smegmatis group, M. mucogenicum group, M. mageritense\/M. wolinskyi, and the pigmented RGM. M. fortuitum group has historically included M. fortuitum, M. peregrinum, M. senegalense, M. porcinum, M. neworleansense, M. boenickei, M. houstonense, M. brisbanense, M. septicum, and M. setense [1]. Ocular infections caused by RGM are keratitis, scleritis, uveitis and endophthalmitis. The predisposing factors of ocular RGM infections include trauma, cataract surgery, intravitreal injection, corticosteroid use, endogenous endophthalmitis, glaucoma drainage implant (GDI) and systemic immunosuppression [2]. Endophthalmitis induced by RGM is an uncommon condition encountered post ocular surgery or trauma, which is sight threatening, may be acquired through contamination of water or antiseptic solutions. Most RGM endophthalmitis cases reported in the literature are exogenous, most of which occurred following cataract surgery [3, 4], multiple corneal transplantation [5, 6], intravitreal triamcinolone injection [7], ocular trauma [8], GDI surgery [9], silico ne-filled eye [10]. Here, we present a case of delayed-onset postoperative endophthalmitis caused by M. houstonense after GDI surgery. The device of GDI is used to drain aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye into the subconjunctival or suprachoroidal space in order to lower the intraocular pressure in glaucoma cases [11]."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where does M. houstonense normally exist?","id":"277-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"water","answer_start":500,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"RGM is a rare cause of endophthalmitis. To date, our case was the first to demonstrate an ocular M. houstonense infection without any signs of systemic association. The patient had history of GDI surgery for refractory glaucoma, and experienced unbearable pain before AGV dislocation, thus we speculate that AGV tube exposure due to conjunctival dissolution could be the primary risk factor for the development of M. houstonense infection. Literature states that M. houstonense are commonly found in water, and freshwater fish are potential reservoirs of RGM [16]. Intriguingly, the patient\u2019s occupation was aquaculture, thus it\u2019s concluded that the aquaculture water where he worked may be the source of RGM infection. The diagnosis of RGM infection post-surgery is often delayed due to chronic and subtle course of disease without specific symptoms. Apart from patients with AIDS, disseminated RGM infection is usually associated with corticosteroid therapy, immunomodulating drugs and transplant patients [17]. In our case, the endophthalmitis lasted for almost 2 months without dissemination in the absence of appropriate treatment, which is probably because the patient has no any underlying diseases and endophthalmitis caused by RGM usually present as low-grade ocular inflammation [18]. Endophthalmitis is a rare complication following AGV implant surgery and results in poor vision, conjunctival erosions over the AGV tube has been reported in most cases and seem to represent a major risk factor for associated endophthalmitis [19]. The conventional treatments of endophthalmitis involve systemic and intravitreal injection of antibiotics, in combination with early pars plana vitrectomy surgery [20]. But currently, there has been no consensus on standard treatment for RGM infection. Lifelong follow-up of the eyes is very necessary to look for complications such as tube erosion after GDI surgeries, and prompt surgical intervention of conjunctival erosion is highly recommended. In patients with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, microbiological investigations of vitreous with antibiotic susceptibility can offer rapid detection, which is of utmost importance to prevent devastating sequel of endophthalmitis."}]}]},{"species":"Bacteroides coprocola","docs":[{"title":"Bacteroides plebeius sp. nov. and Bacteroides coprocola sp. nov., isolated from human faeces","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Bacteroides coprocola is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"278-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":17,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Bacteroides coprocola normally exist?","id":"278-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"human faeces","answer_start":65,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Bacteroides coprocola's requirement for oxygen?","id":"278-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"anaerobic","answer_start":32,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Bacteroides coprocola?","id":"278-1-1-4","answers":[{"text":"rod","answer_start":42,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Nine strains of Gram-negative, anaerobic rod were isolated from human faeces.

Although exposure to NTM frequently causes no symptoms, clinical manifestations may range from hypersensitivity reactions (2) to destructive, even fatal, lung disease. In the case of lung disease caused by NTM, clinical and radiologic features are sometimes indistinguishable from those seen in lung disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB). The clinical importance of NTM is often difficult to determine, especially in patients with chronic, preexisting lung disease; criteria for diagnosing disease caused by NTM, most recently updated by the American Thoracic Society in 1997 (3), need to be properly fulfilled.

In those reports, clinical and radiographic features of M. triplex pulmonary infection did not differ substantially from those of TB and other NTM. Cough, hemoptysis, and fatigue were the primary symptoms, while radiographic studies found pulmonary nodules most commonly, followed by lung infiltrates, multifocal bronchiectasis, and cavitations (Table 1). No patient had underlying diseases when pulmonary infection with M. triplex was diagnosed, and tuberculin skin test results were negative or not reported. Although a history of preexisting pulmonary lesions could not be documented for these patients, repeated isolation of mycobacteria from different respiratory samples and the absence of other possible causes of pulmonary disease suggest that M. triplex was likely to cause symptomatic infection rather than colonization (3). M. triplex strains were isolated on both liquid and solid media in our case, while culture media were not reported in the other two previously published cases. One case reported an extended panel of biochemical and cultural tests for conventional identification that showed the absence of pigment and positive reactions to nitrate reductase, urease, and semiquantitative catalase as the most useful characteristics for tentative identification (15). All strains failed to hybridize with the commercially available genetic probe for MAC (Accuprobe, Gen-Probe Inc., San Diego, CA), so all reported cases could be definitively identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and similarity search with the BLAST alignment software (www.blast.genome.ad.jp). One strain showed 100% homology with the reference strain, while another showed homology of 99.5% and, therefore, despite its close relationship, was regarded as a variant of M. triplex (15). Patients (including our case-patient) were given different treatment regimens with two to four antimicrobial agents. Ethambutol, rifampin, clarithromycin, and ciprofloxacin were mainly used (Table 1). Clinical improvement, as defined by resolution of symptoms and radiographic findings (infiltrates and cavitary lesions), was obtained within 10 months after therapy was initiated in one of three patients.

At the time of the diagnosis, the patient's chest CT findings were not specific. We therefore suspected that the bursitis had developed after unrecognized trauma of the right hand, which gradually worsened over the next two years. Additionally, long-term corticosteroids use for ITP and AIHA likely triggered bacteremia and disseminated lesions in this case. MABC is considered the most pathogenic RGM to mainly cause respiratory infections. A retrospective cohort study of 108 MABC infections showed the following types: 59 (54.6%) respiratory infections, 21 (19.4%) bloodstream infections (BSIs), 10 (9.2%) skin and soft tissue infections, and 3 (2.8%) disseminated infections (4). Regarding disseminated MABC infections, the duration from the symptom onset to the diagnosis was over 3 months in 48% of cases (5). The mortality rate of patients with disseminated infections is relatively high, especially among immunosuppressed patients (5). While the exact pathophysiology of rice body formation remains unclear, rice bodies are thought to form as the result of nonspecific responses to chronic synovial inflammation. Metaplasia of subsynovial connective tissue into cartilage nodules is observed. Rice bodies are associated with tuberculous arthritis, osteoarthritis and infective arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis (6). Bursitis caused by NTM is thought to be a very rare presentation (7-9); thus, the optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for bursitis caused by NTM is unclear. Long-term antimicrobial therapy is generally performed (8). Furthermore, the optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for bursitis with rice bodies caused by MABC remains unknown. Subspecies identification of MABC is recommended by the American Thoracic Society\/the Infectious Diseases Society of America guideline (10). Subspecies identification helps infer antimicrobial susceptibility. For example, M. abscessus and M. bolletii have an activated erm gene and resistance to macrolide drugs, whereas M. massiliense is usually susceptible to CAM (11). DDH and matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, which are usually performed in Japan, cannot distinguish MABC subspecies (12,13). MABC is reportedly resistant to all standard anti-tuberculous drugs; thus, no reliable treatment regimen exists. It is important to select antimicrobials based on appropriate susceptibility testing. However, appropriate susceptibility testing for candidate agents, such as STFX and FRPM, is difficult to perform in Japanese general hospitals. We therefore suspect that most clinicians are not confident about how best to treat disseminated MABC infections. In the present case, subspecies identification by multiplex PCR and additional antimicrobial susceptibility testing led us to select an oral regimen comprising STFX and CAM. Two points need to be discussed in this case: the delayed diagnosis and optimal antimicrobial therapy. First, the patient's presentation with a swollen joint without pain and redness and subtle inflammatory response led to a misdiagnosis of non-infective bursitis for two years. A delayed diagnosis of bursitis caused by NTM has been previously reported (8). We considered that the delayed diagnosis of bursitis caused by M. massiliense in the present case resulted in rice body formation and M. massiliense BSI. Therefore, clinicians must consider infective bursitis caused by NTM in immunocompromised patients, even if they do not complain of pain or have subtle pain in swollen joints. Blood cultures may contribute to the early diagnosis of disseminated RGM infections when clinicians encounter immunosuppressed patients with chronic bursitis. Second, long-term antimicrobial therapy is needed and should be initiated at the diagnosis. However, we were unable to determine an effective combination regimen based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing at our hospital. Early consultation with a specific center about species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing for MABC isolate might help improve the prognosis of patients with disseminated MABC infections who require long-term therapy. BrothMIC RGM (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial, Tokyo, Japan) has been available in Japan since 2019 (14), so we have been able to obtain susceptibility results of RGM based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute in community hospitals.

The most common organisms causing peritonitis are S. aureus, Enterococcus, Escherichia. coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Relatively fewer cases caused by nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) have been reported [1, 2]. A mycobacteroides abscessus complex is a group of NTM that can cause peritonitis related to poor prognosis than the other NTM [2]. Therefore, appropriate treatment is necessary for peritonitis caused by bacteria. The M. abscessus complex has three subspecies: Mycobacteroides abscessus, Mycobacteroides massiliense, and Mycobacteroides bolletii [3]. Since the three subspecies have different susceptibilities to antibiotics, an increasing number of investigations have emphasized the importance of their definite identification.

The susceptibility to antibiotics and pathogenicity varies in each individual. Therefore, it is necessary to identify these subspecies and pay attention to their susceptibility especially macrolides. The M. abscessus complex belongs to the Runyon classification group IV, which rapidly grows within 7 days [6]. The M. abscessus complex has been isolated from surface water, tap water, and soil [7]. The major clinical manifestations of M. abscessus complex are skin and soft-tissue infections and respiratory infections, and only a few cases of peritonitis have been documented [8]. Rapidly growing NTM comprises approximately 3% of the causative pathogens of PD-associated infections [9]. The M. abscessus complex accounts for 8.8% of NTM-caused peritonitis and is associated with poor outcomes [2]. Considering the number of NTM peritonitis cases is increasing [10, 11], it is important to appropriately manage peritonitis caused by M. abscessus complex. The M. abscessus complex is resistant to several antibiotics. In addition to surgical removal of the infected foci, it is recommended to treat patients with multiple agents including macrolides [8]. Yoshimura et al. reported that 82.1% of peritonitis or exit-site infections require catheter removal [12]. Furthermore, a case of exit-site infection requiring catheter removal after the termination of antibiotic therapy has been reported [13]. Considering that almost all the peritonitis cases failed to continue PD and that some cases resulted in patient death [9, 12], it seems necessary to remove the PD catheter when the M. abscessus complex is isolated. Recently, M. abscessus complex has been classified into three subspecies; M. abscessus, M. massiliense, and M. bolletii [3, 14]. These subspecies cannot be distinguished by MALDI-TOF MS, which is usually used for clinical isolates; therefore, previous reports of M. abscessus complex are a mixture of three subspecies. Multiplex PCR targeting several primer sets enabled clear identification of the M. abscessus complex [5]. Clinical behavior, particularly susceptibility to antibiotics, differs among each subspecies [15]. M. massiliense responded well to macrolides, whereas M. abscessus was resistant [16]. Similarly, M. abscessus lead to poor outcomes due to resistance to clarithromycin, whereas M. massiliense was susceptible [15]. M. abscessus possesses a gene responsible for inducible resistance to macrolides [17]; thus, treatment with macrolides must be carefully determined when treating M. abscessus complex. Furthermore, M. massiliense has been reported to cause outbreaks [18]. Therefore, a clear identification of M. massiliense is necessary. In the present case, the patient showed exit-site and trans-catheter infections without any signs of peritonitis. Peritonitis appeared after simultaneous removal and reinsertion of the catheter. The patient was not immunocompromised. The long duration of oral antibiotics before admission may have influenced the emergence of NTM. As the culture of the pus and dialysate effluent was negative on admission, it is important to suspect acid-fast bacilli when the culture-negative infection persists. In the present case, M. abscessus was initially recovered from the culture; however, it was later identified as M. massiliense. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of PD-associated peritonitis caused by M. massiliense. Further consideration of this organism would lead to better treatment of peritonitis in the future."}]}]},{"species":"M.\u00a0abscessus subsp\u00a0.\u00a0bolletii","docs":[{"title":"Bacteraemia caused by Mycobacterium abscessus subsp. abscessus and M. abscessus subsp. bolletii: clinical features and susceptibilities of the isolates","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can M.\u00a0abscessus subsp\u00a0.\u00a0bolletii cause?","id":"287-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"bacteraemia","answer_start":817,"id":1},{"text":"bacteraemia","answer_start":1014,"id":2},{"text":"bacteraemia","answer_start":1400,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are M.\u00a0abscessus subsp\u00a0.\u00a0bolletii sensitive to?","id":"287-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"Clarithromycin and tigecycline","answer_start":1422,"id":1},{"text":"Clarithromycin and tigecycline","answer_start":1653,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Mycobacterium abscessus complex (M. abscessus subsp. abscessus and M. abscessus subsp. bolletii) is an emerging pathogen causing various human infections.

Sixty M. kansasii isolates were collected for investigating the clinical characteristics of patients with M. kansasii infections as well as drug susceptibility and genotypes of M. kansasii.

According to the internal transcribed spacers (ITS), rpoB, hsp65, and tuf, all M. kansasii isolates were classified as molecular type I, irrespective of the disease manifestation. Sixty M. kansasii isolates from China were diverse and separated into four branches. Pairwise average nucleotide identity (ANI) values for M. kansasii isolates affiliated with different genotypes were more than 85%. The earliest isolate was isolated from Jiangsu in 1983. Of the isolates, 78.3% (47\/60) were isolated since 1999. All isolates were sensitive to rifabutin. All but one isolate was sensitive to clarithromycin. Sensitivity rates to rifampin, amikacin, moxifloxacin, and linezolid were 80.0%, 90.0%, 88.3%, and 91.7%, respectively. A high rate of resistance was noted for ciprofloxacin (44 isolates, 73.3%) and ethambutol (46 isolates, 76.7%).

This bacterium is a slow-growing, atypical acid-fast bacillus that is ubiquitously found in the environment, namely tap water [1,2]. Therefore, this pathogen was commonly considered contamination or colonization. We now know that this pathogen can cause a wide range of diseases including lung disease, lymphadenopathy, skin, and soft tissue infection, osteomyelitis, and disseminated disease [2]. These presentations occur more commonly in immunocompromised patients. M. kansasii is the second most common cause of lung disease secondary to an NTM following Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in the United States [3,4]. Bronchopulmonary disease is the most frequent presentation of infection with M. kansasii and commonly occurs in patients with underlying lung disease [3,5]. Presenting symptoms may include dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, weight loss, fever, and night sweats [5]. The course of the disease can be indolent, lasting several months to years; however, it may occasionally be rapidly progressive [6,7]. Infection due to M. kansasii can be clinically indistinguishable from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Infection is usually diagnosed via bronchoscopy, tissue biopsy, thoracentesis, or pericardiocentesis using culture findings, biochemical testing, or high-performance liquid chromatography. While pleural effusions can be seen with pulmonary disease due to mycobacterium, around 5% of cases are due to M. tuberculosis, they are very rarely seen with M. kansasii [6].

Search terms included \u201cmycobacterium kansasii\u201d and \u201cpleural effusion\u201d. Only cases from the English language literature were included. A case was defined by documented M. kansasii infection with the recovery of this organism from a culture of either sputum, bronchoscopy, gastric aspirate, or other normally sterile fluid such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid in the presence of empyema without other etiology between 1980 and 2020. Cases of empyema were defined using the standard definition of collection of infected exudate within the pleural cavity. Cases were included in the analysis if enough demographic information was available to allow the identification of individual patients. Demographic information included age and gender.  Results Demographics A total of 22 cases of M. kansasii pleural effusion were reported between 1980 and 2020 [2-4,6-21]. These included 13 men (59.0 %) and nine women (40.9%). Ages ranged from 24 to 87 years with a mean age of 52.9 \u00b1 19.5. Underlying Conditions Over two-thirds of the patients reviewed were noted to have underlying comorbidities with the majority of these causing a weakened immune system (Table \u200b(Table1).1). The most common conditions were malignancies and receipt of an organ transplant. Nine patients (39.2%) were taking immunosuppressive medications [4,6,9,12-13,16,18-21]. *Some patients had more than one underlying condition \u2020 Rheumatoid arthritis (2), pneumothorax (1), prior severe viral infection (1), coronary artery disease (1), COPD(1) Pleural Effusion The laterality of effusion was identified in 14 cases (60.9%). Seven (50%) of these patients had a right-sided effusion [4,7,9-11], three (21.4%), including our case, had a left-sided effusion [13] and four (28.9%) had bilateral effusions [8,13-14,21]. Two left pleural effusions were reported as large [4,8] and two right pleural effusions were reported as small [7,11]. Otherwise, size was not reported. The pleural effusions were found to be exudative in five (21.7%) cases [6-8,14]; the other 18 cases did not report pleural fluid studies to be able to determine this information. Of the cases, 15 were isolated pleural effusions, while eight showed pulmonary signs of pneumothorax [7,8], cavitation [4,12], abscess [4], infiltrate [10,13,14], and lung nodules [15]. Diagnosis of pleural effusion involved computed tomography (CT) scan in 12 (52.2%) cases [7-11,13-15,18,20-21], and chest radiograph in nine (39.1%) [5,7-9,11,12,14,18,20]. Seven cases had both imaging studies performed [7-9,11,14,18,20]. Cultures of the pleural fluid were reported in all cases. All cases were noted to have cultures positive for M. kansasii except for one where cultures were negative. In this case, the patient was noted to have a positive culture previously [14]. Symptoms and Signs Fifteen (65.2%) of the cases described reported signs and symptoms of the patient upon presentation and throughout the hospital stay (Table \u200b(Table2).2). The most commonly reported symptoms included fever, pulmonary symptoms including chest pain, cough, and dyspnea as well as constitutional symptoms. Cases with suspicion of disseminated disease presented atypically. The primary complaints of these patients included gastrointestinal and cardiac symptoms [4,12,15]. Treatment Definitive therapy was reported for 19 of the 23 cases (82.6%). Most patients initially received some variation of RIPE therapy consisting of rifampin (RFP) and isoniazid (INH) with either pyrazinamide (PZA) or ethambutol (EB) or, in some cases, both PZA and EB (Table \u200b(Table3).3). In all the cases that mentioned therapy, the patients were found to have received combination therapy. The most common combination included RFP, INH, and EB only. Of the cases reporting the use of RIPE, only one mentioned additional therapy with prednisone; it is noted that this patient did survive [14]. One case reported the use of open-window thoracostomy in management [9]. The duration of treatment was reported for only six patients: two for \u22646 months, two between 6-12 months, and two for >12 months. Susceptibility of the bacterial isolates was reported in three cases [10,14-15]. *Reported based on final treatment (before discharge\/death) RFP: rifampin; INH: isoniazid; PZA: pyrazinamide; EB: ethambutol Complications and Outcomes. The outcome was reported for 21 of the 23 cases (91.3%), with 14 surviving, five dying, and two being lost to follow-up. While the causes of death varied (Table \u200b(Table4),4), the most commonly reported was overwhelming sepsis while receiving treatment in the inpatient setting [13,15]. DIC: disseminated intravascular coagulation Discussion Mycobacterium kansasii is an NTM known to be a ubiquitous environmental pathogen, found mainly in tap water. It is the second most common NTM in AIDS patients, after MAC [4]. There are seven identified genotypes of M. kansasii with Types I and II being the most common clinical isolates. Type I is most likely responsible for infections in Europe, the United States, and Japan [22]. Infection usually occurs via aspiration or local environmental inoculation via the aerosol route and there is little evidence of person-to-person transmission. The incidence of M. kansasii infection increased following the emergence of HIV. Longitudinal prevalence studies have been inconsistent, which is thought to be related to considerable regional variability [22]. In a survey prior to the HIV epidemic, the annual incidence was 0.5 per 100,000 in 44 states of the United States. However, the incidence of infection is estimated to be as high as 532 cases per 100,000 in populations with HIV [22]. Rates are relatively high in England, Wales, and South America with increasing incidence in Israel, Korea, Spain, Portugal, France, Brazil, and Japan. In HIV-positive patients with advanced immunosuppression, the lung is the most common organ involved in M. kansasii infection [23,24]. It is reported that 20% of HIV-positive patients with M. kansasii infection will develop disseminated disease [23]. Of the two cases with HIV-positive individuals in our review, neither developed disseminated disease and both survived [10,11]. This review demonstrated fewer cases in patients who had HIV as an underlying condition than initially anticipated considering widely supported data about differential rates of transmission. Despite being statistically insignificant, it is noteworthy that four cases reported hematologic malignancy, including myelodysplastic syndrome, hairy cell leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and lung cancer. The most common causes of pleural effusion are congestive heart failure, cancer, bacterial pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism [25]. Pleural effusions secondary to bacterial pneumonia are characterized by exudate with associated symptoms of cough, fever, and infiltrate. Signs and symptoms were not reported for all cases, and the effusions in only five cases were distinguished as exudate. Symptoms typically seen in pulmonary M. kansasii include cough, sputum production, weight loss, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, and fever and sweats [23] Five of the cases presented patients who died during their hospital course. One case did not report the reason for death, but in case of the other four patients, deaths occurred in the hospital, with conditions not directly related to the M. kansasii pleural effusion (cardiopulmonary arrest, sepsis, multi-organ failure). Despite the 22 cases reported in the literature, data was not consistently reported across the case reports. Without consistent data, large conclusions cannot be drawn. Reporting guidelines, such as the Case Reports (CARE) guidelines, should be implemented to ensure transparency and complete reporting [26]. The CARE guidelines include demographic information, main symptoms, medical history, physical exam, intervention, outcomes, and other items to be included in a case report. The inclusion of many of these items consistently across reviewed cases may have improved the conclusions of this paper."}]}]},{"species":"Corynebacterium urealyticum","docs":[{"title":"Corynebacterium urealyticum: a comprehensive review of an understated organism","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Corynebacterium urealyticum is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"289-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram positive","answer_start":33,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Corynebacterium urealyticum cause?","id":"289-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"a variety of diseases including but not limited to cystitis, pyelonephritis, and bacteremia among others","answer_start":237,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Corynebacterium urealyticum?","id":"289-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic nosocomial pathogen","answer_start":183,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Corynebacterium urealyticum is a Gram positive, slow-growing, lipophilic, multi-drug resistant, urease positive micro-organism with diphtheroid morphology.

It was named C. urealyticum stressing its strong ability to split urea. C. urealyticum is isolated from the groin of elderly patients receiving broad spectrum antibiotics with relative frequency, thus providing an ideal environment that may favor colonization of urinary catheters with subsequent infection of bladder mucosa particularly in the setting of co-morbidities (trauma, tumor, or inflammation).

C. urealyticum isolates are usually missed in routine urine cultures since it does not grow well after an overnight incubation. However C. urealyticum can be isolated after 48 hours of incubation at 35\u00b0C\u201337\u00b0C preferably in 10% CO2 mainly on blood agar. Colonies are characteristically pinpoint, whitish, opaque, smooth, convex, circular, and non-hemolytic. The identification of C. urealyticum is one of the biggest challenges facing the laboratory. Phenotypic studies using home-made media or commercial systems (API Coryne) can be used for proper identification. Identification can also be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The majority of C. urealyticum strains are highly resistant to a large number of antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, B-lactams, and macrolides although teicoplanin and vancomycin remain universally active against these isolates. C. urealyticum can be considered an underestimated cause of sepsis among hospitalized patients. However, adequate identification and therapy may be lifesaving.

The patient lived in Pucheng County of Shaanxi Province and was a peasant with daily exposure to an agricultural environment. His medical history did not reveal any specific illness, including AIDS. He did not smoke or consume alcohol and had no recent travel outside his hometown. Approximately half a month prior to presentation, the patient noticed a nonremovable dense shadow in the lower field of vision of his right eye after heavy manual work. He underwent fundus laser treatment in a local hospital without improvement. Therefore, he was admitted to the Department of Ophthalmology in our hospital with the diagnosis of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) in the right eye. Cryopexy was performed successfully, and the retina reattached well. Triphosadenine, coenzyme A, citicoline, and riboflavin sodium phosphate were given intravenously to help the recovery of the retina after the operation. The next day, 2 h after infusion of the same medications, the patient presented with an elevated temperature of 39.9\u00b0C. Ibuprofen was given and helped to control the fever. However, the patient had an increased respiratory rate (RR), weak pulse, and low blood pressure (BP; 60\/30 mm Hg) 3 h after infusion. On examination in the ICU, the vital signs of the patient were as follows: body temperature, 38.0\u00b0C; heart rate (HR), 118 beats\/min; BP, 71\/39 mm Hg; and RR, 26 breaths\/min. There was a yellowish pigmentation of the skin and left conjunctiva. His right eye was covered by sterile dressing, which was dry. Cyanosis, cardiac murmur, and breath sounds were absent. Moreover, his liver and spleen were not palpable. Percussion pain was found over the right renal region but not the left. Laboratory examinations revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 32.34 \u00d7 10\/liter with 96.7% neutrophils, C-reactive protein of 92.7 mg\/liter, procalcitonin of >10 ng\/ml, albumin of 19.38 g\/liter, alanine aminotransferase of 124 U\/liter, aspartate aminotransferase of 147 U\/liter, total bilirubin of 51.45 \u03bcmol\/liter, blood urea nitrogen of 12.23 mmol\/liter, and creatinine of 239.06 \u03bcmol\/liter. Both B-scan ultrasonography and abdominal computed tomography (CT) images revealed calculous cholecystitis. The patient was placed on empirical intravenous meropenem and linezolid therapy at 1.0 g every 8 h and 600 mg every 12 h, respectively (day 1 to day 7). Symptomatic treatments were also administered, including 20 g\/day immunoglobulin (day 1 to day 4) and 1 million units\/day ulinastatin (an anti-inflammatory agent, day 1 to day 2) for anti-inflammation, 500 ml\/day hydroxyethyl starch 130\/0.4 and sodium chloride and 20 g\/day albumin for blood volume restoration (day 1 to day 2), dopamine (200 mg\/5 h on day 1 and 400 mg\/12 h on day 2 to day 5) to increase blood pressure, and blood purification therapy for toxin elimination and organ protection (day 1 to day 4). The patient remained clinically stable, with improvement in his signs and symptoms. In addition, his right eye recovered well. Blood cultures performed 4 days after the completion of antibiotic treatment showed no growth. Blood cultures were conducted prior to antibiotic treatment. The aerobic bottles from each of four separately taken sets of blood cultures were incubated in the BacT\/Alert three-dimensional (3D) system (bioM\u00e9rieux). Positive growth was shown in all cultures, and Gram-positive rods were observed by Gram stain. Subcultures on 5% sheep's blood agar (bioM\u00e9rieux) revealed tiny, nonhemolytic, white colonies after overnight incubation at 35\u00b0C in 5% CO2. The colonies were catalase and oxidase positive. After 3 days of incubation, colonies were yellow pigmented. The RapID CB Plus system (REMEL Inc., USA) identified all isolates as Leifsonia aquatica (99.9% probability, profile 0675513). The strains were further identified by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene from genomic DNA. A 1,390-bp fragment was amplified using the universal primers 27F (AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) and XB4 (GTGTGTACAAGGCCCGGGAAC) (1, 2). PCR products were purified and sequenced by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using Etest strips (bioM\u00e9rieux) on Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 5% sheep's blood according to the manufacturer's instruction. After the incubation at 35\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 24 h, the MICs of penicillin G, vancomycin, imipenem, meropenem, and linezolid were >32 \u03bcg\/ml, 12 \u03bcg\/ml, 4 \u03bcg\/ml, 4 \u03bcg\/ml, and 0.75 \u03bcg\/ml, respectively. L. aquatica is a non-spore-forming Gram-positive rod. Being a resident of environmental water habitats, it has been isolated from distilled water, municipal water supplies, and private wells (3). L. aquatica grows in opaque colonies and produces a yellow pigment after extended incubation. This bacterium is catalase and oxidase positive. L. aquatica was once recognized as a species of the Corynebacterium genus. However, because of the chemotaxonomic and genetic differences from corynebacteria, it has been reclassified (4). Of the four species currently assigned to the genus Leifsonia, only L. aquatica is considered a medically relevant species (3). Infections due to L. aquatica are rarely reported, typically being catheter related in immunocompromised patients. For example, catheter-associated bloodstream infections caused by L. aquatica are observed mainly in hemodialysis-dependent patients suffering from chronic or end-stage renal diseases (3\u20135). Furthermore, peritoneal dialysis peritonitis (6, 7) and HIV-related septic shock (8) have been reported. In contrast, the patient in our case was in good health and did not use any catheters. Moreover, the retinal reattachment surgery was carried out under standard procedure with sufficient sterilization. Such an acute onset and severe symptoms of septicemia caused by L. aquatica were observed for the first time in an immunocompetent individual, indicating a potential significant role of this bacterium in causing infectious diseases. Since L. aquatica has properties of passing through polycarbonate water filters (9), low growth rate, and biofilm formation, which likely contribute to the pathogenicity of this bacterium in immunocompromised patients with exogenous devices (10), the intravenous fluids were suspected as a source of L. aquatica contamination. However, cultures from these resources were negative. Additionally, no other patient in the unit showed similar symptoms after treatment with the same batch of intravenous fluids and medications. Thus, the origin of this septicemia is unclear. A potential source of Leifsonia infection might be via the oral cavity, where species of this genus have been isolated recently (11). In addition, a variety of bacteria have been recovered from different sites of the gallbladder in symptomatic cholelithiasis (12). Considering the radiographic results of calculous cholecystitis, cholelithiasis might be a reason for the acute bacterial infection in our patient. Postoperative ocular infections due to various bacteria have been described (13, 14), whereas occurrence of bloodstream infection after ophthalmologic operations is scarcely reported. To our knowledge, this is the first case of Leifsonia septicemia in a patient with normal immunity after cryopexy. The optimum regimen for management of L. aquatica infections is uncertain, whereas the routinely used antibiotic for therapy is vancomycin (3, 4). Even if symptomatic resolution could occur within 2 days after the therapy with vancomycin, a long course of treatment is normally administered for 2 to 6 weeks (3, 4). Besides, relapse of L. aquatica peritonitis after the treatment with intraperitoneal vancomycin has been reported in a 17-year-old boy undergoing automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). The second round of vancomycin therapy was unable to eradicate the bacteria until the PD catheter was removed (7). Our result was consistent with previous reports that L. aquatica shows intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin (3, 15), which has been considered not being the most effective treatment for L. aquatica infections (4). Resistance to penicillin G has also been described (3). Because of the slow growth of the causative pathogen, an empirical antibiotic treatment was performed with meropenem in combination with linezolid in this case. The septicemia was controlled efficiently within 7 days, indicating the effectiveness of meropenem and linezolid in the therapy of L. aquatica infection. This report provides new evidence that L. aquatica, an environmental coryneform bacterium, is able to cause serious infection in healthy person. It highlighted the potential pathogenicity of this bacterium. Potential endogenous nidus, e.g., cholelithiasis, might be an initial source of bacterial infection. Antimicrobial therapy using meropenem and linezolid was an effective treatment of L. aquatica septicemia.

Coryneform bacteria are a diverse group of aerobically growing non-spore forming, irregularly shaped gram-positive rods. Geographical variations in the frequency of isolated species and variations in natural and acquired antimicrobial resistance have been described (1). Diagnosis of coryneform bacteria remains a challenge for routine checks, due to the large number of different species belonging to this group (2,3). Isolates of coryneform gram-positive rods are often difficult to identify for diagnostic laboratories. Modern technologies such as MALDI-TOF MS and\/or RNA sequencing molecular detection methods for bacterial pathogens in fluids provide sensitive, specific and rapid results (4). The incidence of Corynebacterium spp. as pathogens of nosocomial infections associated with septicemia, endocarditis, infections of surgical wounds and infections related to the use of invasive medical devices is increasing. Blood culture is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of bacteremia. The incidence and clinical presentations of Corynebacterium spp. infections differ in children and adults (5). Non-diphtheria Corynebacterium species have been increasingly recognized as multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens that also infect immunocompromised patients (5), and Vancomycin is still considered the primary drug of choice in the control of this infection. The indication of the removal of catheters is recommended in guidelines, such as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2017 (CLSI, 2017), with the aim of avoiding bacteremia or sepsis of in immunocompromised patients. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of clinical isolates is also recommended by the CLSI guidelines (6). Additional studies of actions and medications that influence in the bacterial adherence may contribute to more effective drugs and new guidelines. In the present article, the case of an L. aquatica infection (before Corynebacterium aquaticum infection) isolated from a pediatric patient with a Wilms tumor who was kept on a catheter long term is described. This bacteria is a bacilli gram positive, and has a natural affinity for moist surfaces and or water-based solutions and can infect animals and plants, including human beings (7). This paper should be of interest to a broad readership including those interested in demonstrated that treatment of these infections may contribute to significant changes in clinical and epidemiological features of corynebacterial infections in nosocomial environments."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of drugs are L. aquatica sensitive to?","id":"290-3-3-1","answers":[{"text":"Vancomycin","answer_start":4305,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can L. aquatica cause?","id":"290-3-3-2","answers":[{"text":"central venous catheter related infection","answer_start":3854,"id":1},{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":1951,"id":2},{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":4195,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"In the last two decades, Non-diphtheria Corynebacterium species have been increasingly recognized as MDR pathogens that also infect immunocompromised patients, which may be caused by inappropriate outpatient prescription of antibiotics (3,5,11-13). There are reports of isolation of coryneform bacteria causing nosocomial infections, such as endocarditis, and orthopedic bone and joint infections (14). Isolates of coryneform gram-positive rods are often difficult to identify for diagnostic laboratories (15). There are only a few reports describing an L. aquatica infection in an individual under long-term catheter use (14-19). An integrative review was performed based on the following guiding question: How common is an L. aquatic infection? And what is best antibiotic approach to treat it, primarily in immunocompromised patients? A literature review was performed by searching SCOPUS and MEDLINE, using the key words in medical subject heading (MeSH): \u2018Leifsonia aquatica\u2019, \u2018catheter\u2019, \u2018neoplasms\u2019. Key words were combined using the Boolean operator \u2018AND\u2019. The inclusion criteria were as follow: Original articles, letters to the editor and bibliographic reviews published in English. No timeframe was set in this research. The evaluated aspects were: Documents by type, documents by country\/territory, documents by affiliation, documents by author, periodic research and publication by year. Articles that were considered other aspects of L. aquatica infections related were excluded from this review. Information on the cause of the case that was defined as being of importance for discussion in this integrative review. The description in the title and abstracts were assessed in the filtered articles obtained. Evaluation and critical analysis of the articles involved classifying them by case reports in immunocompromised patients. A review of the literature revealed a case report involving dialysis patients with documented L. aquatica bacteremia (19) Searching the two databases, SCOPUS and MEDLINE. In SCOPUS, 15 articles were retrieved; and 3 were discarded as they were deemed irrelevant based on either the title or the abstract. Thus 12 articles were obtained. In MEDLINE, 17 articles were selected but articles were the written language was not English were discarded, and 1 article was a duplicate between the two databases. The case reports selected after filtering out irrelevant articles are shown in Table I. The source basis, signals and symptoms, the laboratory results, comorbidities associated, equipment used to identify L. aquatic infection, the susceptible antibiotic tests used in each related case report and the outcome of each case patient is described. This review of the literature did not reveal any other case report describing the case of an L. aquatica infection in a patient with cancer or a pediatric patient. Case reports on L. aquatic infections between 1975 and 2017. 16SrRNA DNA was sequenced. M, male; F, female; CAPD, continuous ambulatory abdominal catheter peritoneal dialysis; CVC, central venous catheter. In the present report, the rare case of an L. aquatica infection isolated from a pediatric patient with a Wilms tumor is described. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only report of an L. aquatica infection in Brazil associated with long term catheter use. This report highlights the possibility of a rare case of L. aquatica infection isolated during chemotherapy treatment for Wilms Tumor, and the clinical aspects of this patient, and the subsequent developments for improving treatment were analyzed. A study by Adderson et al describes some cases of Coryneform bacterial infections in a pediatric oncological setting. They proposed that the incidence and presentation of these infections differed in children and adults (20). In the present study, L. aquatica was responsible for central venous catheter related infection in the pediatric patient with solid malignant tumor. Most reports of corynebacterial infections describe single patients, and thus the characteristics of these infections are poorly defined (17,21-26). Certain articles highlight the pathogenicity of this bacterium as the primary causative agent of bacteremia in patients on dialysis and is not considered a simple episode of opportunistic infection (27-30). Vancomycin has been considered the treatment of choice for management of corynebacterial infections (11,31). Indeed, the majority of reports from Europe show C. Jeikeium as susceptible to vancomycin, but resistant to other antibiotics (5,32). The biofilm on catheter surfaces formed by this agent complicates eradication of this bacteria (33). Additional complications, such as longer hospitalization periods, use of other catheters or a non-competent patient increase the necessity of catheter removal. Thus, introducing vancomycin for management of these infections may be a sensible approach to reduce the risk of worsening of infections. Vancomycin remains the better option as empiric treatment of catheter Corynebacterium infection (34,35). This approach reduces the risk of making an assumption of the nature of the pathogen based on \u2018common sense\u2019, which could increase the risk to the patient. Instead, correct identification and treatment can prevent further complications. In Conclusion, infections by Corynebacterium species are increasingly being recognized as causative agents of bloodstream and venous catheter-related infections in immunocompromised patients. With the development and advancement of novel technologies and improvement in diagnostic approaches, and the possibility of using new medications guided by accurate clinical laboratory identification with suitable sensitivity, non-Corynebacterium may be implicated in an increasing number of deaths in immunocompromised patients. This literature review highlights the increasing importance of the potential for infections and the problems they can cause in patients using catheters."}]}]},{"species":"Streptococcus gallolyticus","docs":[{"title":"Bacteremia due to Streptococcus gallolyticus: A Name with an Ominous Significance?","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Streptococcus gallolyticus cause?","id":"291-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Bacteremia","answer_start":182,"id":1},{"text":"Bacteremia","answer_start":824,"id":2},{"text":"endocarditis","answer_start":311,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Streptococcus bovis is an underrecognized agent of systemic infections.

In marine mammals, S. iniae was first isolated in Brazil in 1972 from a captive Amazon River dolphin (Inia geoffrensis) displaying numerous bilateral subcutaneous skin abscesses [1]. Subsequently, it has been identified in additional captive Amazon River dolphins in North America and as a cause of septicaemia and multisystemic inflammation in a captive adult bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) in China [5,6,7]. S. iniae is also a significant zoonotic pathogen, with human disease first reported in 1991 [8]. Worldwide, approximately 27 species of fish have been reported with S. iniae infection [7,9], with sporadic outbreaks reported in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), rainbow trout (Onchorynchus mykiss) [2,3,10,11], and other species including various ornamental fish [7]. A major multi-species wild finfish mortality event was also attributed to S. iniae infection in Australia in 2016 [4]. Disease presentation is variable, with fish showing clinical signs including lethargy, anorexia, melanosis, and exophthalmia. Neurological signs can also occur with meningitis and meningoencephalitis following septicaemic progression of disease [2,9,12]. Mortality rates can be as high as 50% in these outbreaks, accounting for significant economic losses in aquaculture industries [10,13]. All previous reports of S. iniae infection in dolphins have been in captive settings; however, it is thought that disease may occur in free-ranging Amazon River dolphins [14]. Dolphins infected with S. iniae develop a dermatitis with multifocal subcutaneous skin abscessation, often referred to as \u201cgolf -ball\u201d disease [1]. Suppurative enteritis, encephalitis, pancreatitis, and chronic pneumonia following septic progression of disease has also occurred in a Bottlenose dolphin (T. truncatus) [7]. Disease can resolve with treatment and improved husbandry practices, however, fatality is also recorded [1,6,7]. S. iniae is a zoonotic pathogen which causes cellulitis and bacteraemia in humans [7,12]. Septic progression of infection can result in endocarditis, meningitis, arthritis, pneumonia, toxic shock, and osteomyelitis [7,12,15]. While human infection may be opportunistic [9], it has been associated with recent handling and preparation of infected fresh fish and disease has occurred in various locations worldwide [7,8].

However, the cells of these strains were often cocci (coccobacilli), depending on the cultivation time. Colonies of different sizes were detected on Eggerth Gagnon agar plates for these strains. The cells forming large colonies were cocci, whereas those forming small colonies were cocci and rods. However, 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison of colonies of different sizes revealed that only a single organism was present.

Acinetobacter species are now defined as strictly aerobic gram-negative coccobacilli that are nonmotile, catalase positive, oxidase negative, and have a DNA G+C content of 39 to 47% (3). They can survive at a wide range of temperatures on animate and inanimate surfaces and are commonly isolated in hospitals, where these organisms are emerging nosocomial pathogens. At present, the Acinetobacter genus has at least 32 genomic species (10). Acinetobacter baumannii is the most clinically important species (22), presumably because it can rapidly develop resistance to antibiotics. Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU and 3, which are phenotypically similar to A. baumannii, are also commonly encountered in nosocomial infections. Along with an environmental species (Acinetobacter calcoaceticus), these species are classified as the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex (3). This complex is usually identified by commercially available methods based on phenotypic characteristics (4), although more reliable identification requires molecular methods. The identification of non-A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex species by phenotypic methods is more difficult (11). Therefore, the clinical significance of many non-A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex species remains to be determined. However, precise identification is necessary in order to evaluate the clinical significance of a species. For example, the use of a genotypic method (16S rRNA gene analysis) enabled identification of 103 Acinetobacter isolates and showed that two species, Acinetobacter schindleri and Acinetobacter ursingii, were underreported by previous studies (11). DNA-DNA hybridization and sequence analysis are the most widely accepted methods for identifying species, including Acinetobacter (3). DNA-DNA hybridization is considered the gold standard but is labor-intensive and impractical in most clinical laboratories (15). Sequence analysis of housekeeping genes, including the 16S rRNA gene (13), 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (ITS) (6), recA gene (15), rpoB and flanking spacers (16), and gyrB gene (27), also allows identification of Acinetobacter species. Among these genes, the 16S rRNA gene is most commonly used (14). It has been suggested that an unknown isolate can be assigned to a species when its 16S rRNA sequence has a similarity of \u226599% with the reference sequence of a well-defined species and when it has at least 0.5% sequence difference to the second nearest species (4, 14). In the present study, we used genotypic methods to identify Acinetobacter baylyi in six bacteremic patients. Previously, this species was only known to live in the soil. The identification procedures, antimicrobial susceptibility, natural transformability of the isolates and clinical features of the patients are described."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Acinetobacter baylyi normally exist?","id":"297-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"soil and activated sludge","answer_start":265,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can A. baylyi cause?","id":"297-1-3-2","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":3588,"id":1},{"text":"systemic signs of infection and even septic shock","answer_start":3516,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of A. baylyi?","id":"297-1-3-3","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogen with low virulence","answer_start":3964,"id":1},{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":5686,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are A. baylyi sensitive to?","id":"297-1-3-4","answers":[{"text":"imipenem, aminoglycosides, levofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol","answer_start":4924,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"A. baylyi strain ADP1 is highly competent in natural genetic transformation and metabolic versatility (23) and is the most widely investigated species of Acinetobacter. This species is generally considered an environmental bacterium and is frequently isolated from soil and activated sludge (10). There is a recent report of A. baylyi being isolated from clinical samples (17). To our knowledge, there have been no reports of A. baylyi infection of humans. With the use of genotypic identification method, we were able to identify six clinical isolates of A. baylyi from 47 non-A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex species. Currently, there is no quantitative definition of Acinetobacter species based on ITS sequence analysis. Chang et al. showed that the similarity score between the nearest species of Acinetobacter is 92% (6). Although the intraspecies similarities of members of the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex are very high (99 to 100%), the intraspecies similarities of species in the non-A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex are unknown. The ITSs of our clinical isolates best matched those of A. baylyi, with a similarity of 98 to 99%. We found two groups of ITSs, with diverse sequence and length, in A. baylyi strain ADP1. A. haemolyticus and A. johnsonii also have heterogeneity in the number of copies of ITSs (6). However, our phylogenetic analysis clusters the ITSs from both groups in A. baylyi. This indicates that analysis of the ITS from either group of A. baylyi will not lead to misidentification. Compared to ITS analysis, analysis of the 16S rRNA gene is a better way to identify A. baylyi. The 16S rRNA sequence of the 6 clinical isolates yielded a similarity score of \u226599% with sequences of several reference strains of A. baylyi. Moreover, there was \u22650.5 sequence diversity with the nearest Acinetobacter spp. Therefore, based on criteria adopted by most taxonomists (4, 14), the six clinical isolates were confirmed as A. baylyi. The frequency of genetic recombination in A. baylyi might cause different ribopatterns between reference strains and clinical isolates, as previously noted in A. baumannii (8). Although the ribopatterns of our six clinical isolates were not useful for species identification, they were all very similar, indicating a clonal relationship. It was well known that phenotypic methods have the limitation for the identification of Acinetobacter spp. However, the 32 GN system had a better chance of identifying A. baylyi than the Vitek 2 system from clinical samples. We found that the 32 GN system correctly identified all six of the clinical isolates to the genus level, and five were identified as A. baumannii, but with low discrimination. The Vitek 2 system identified three isolates as Acinetobacter with high probability but misidentified these isolates as belonging to the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex. The Vitek 2 misidentified the other three clinical isolates at the genus level. Previous research has also demonstrated that the Vitek 2 fails in the identification of other Acinetobacter species, such as A. ursingii (11) and A. lwoffii (12). It was previously demonstrated that genome of A. baylyi strain ADP1 contains very few traits that are associated with pathogenesis (2). The genome lacks virulence-related genes such as toxins, invasins, and secretory systems, even though it does contain 10 open reading frames encoding hemolysin-like proteins (2). Nevertheless, infection with clinical isolates of A. baylyi can result in systemic signs of infection and even septic shock. Notably, four of our bacteremia patients were infected with A. baylyi alone, indicating that this species can be pathogenic. All of our affected patients had severe underlying diseases (five with either diabetes mellitus or malignancy), only three patients received appropriate therapy, and yet none of the patients died. Although our sample size is very small, this suggests that A. baylyi is an opportunistic pathogen with low virulence. Interestingly, five of our cases acquired the pathogen nosocomially, in which the reservoir was unknown. Although the clinical isolates of A. baylyi were not as resistant to antimicrobial agents as species in the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex, they were more antibiotic resistant than the reference strain, especially to beta-lactams, and all of them demonstrated a production of beta-lactamase. Although IS1236 was detected in five isolates and ISAba1 was detected in one isolate, none had the known ESBL or AmpC type beta-lactamase gene located downstream of these ISs. Although the inhibitory zones of the extended-spectrum cephalosporins did not increase in size in the presence of cloxacillin, the presence of undetermined plasmid-mediated class C beta-lactamases in some of the isolates cannot be excluded owing to the positive result in APB test. Our clinical isolates of A. baylyi were susceptible to imipenem, aminoglycosides, levofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol. The susceptibility to chloramphenicol might differentiate A. baylyi from species of the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex since 98% (146\/149) of the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex strains isolated from the same hospital were resistant to chloramphenicol (7). Four of the clinical isolates had diminished transformability. Bacher et al. had also demonstrated the loss of natural competence in A. baylyi in an evolutionary experiment (1). Loss of transformability might be due to a corresponding increase in fitness (1). In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that A. baylyi is a potential human pathogen. Based on our study, A. baylyi appears to be an opportunistic pathogen that can cause nosocomial infection with a favorable outcome. Clinicians should suspect infection by A. baylyi when an isolate from a clinical sample is identified by the 32 GN system as A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex with low discrimination and the isolate shows susceptibility to chloramphenicol. The isolates can then be subjected to sequence analysis for accurate identification. The high competence of natural transformation and the increasing antibiotic resistance in some of the clinical isolates suggests that this species may become a significant threat in the future."}]}]},{"species":"Acinetobacter bohemicus","docs":[{"title":"Acinetobacter bohemicus sp. nov. widespread in natural soil and water ecosystems in the Czech Republic","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Acinetobacter bohemicus normally exist?","id":"298-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"multiple soil and water samples collected in natural ecosystems in the Czech Republic","answer_start":122,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" We investigated the taxonomic status of a phenetically unique group of 25 Acinetobacter strains which were isolated from multiple soil and water samples collected in natural ecosystems in the Czech Republic.

The current genus designation was initially proposed by Brisou and Pr\u00e9vot in 1954, based on motility [2]. In 1968, a comprehensive survey completed by Baumann et al. provided sufficient data for a group species previously classified to at least 15 different genera and species and reclassified them to a single genus, for which the name Acinetobacter was proposed [2]. Currently, the genus Acinetobacter, which belongs to the class Gammaproteobacteria, is composed of 63 species with validly published names according to List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature, with Acinetobacter calcoaceticus as the type species (http:\/\/www.bacterio.net\/acinetobacter.html; last accessed November 2019) and A. baumannii being the most clinically significant species, implicated in both nosocomial and community-derived infections [1]. This highly complex genus is widely distributed in soil, water, and animals, with members often associated with nosocomial infections\u2014primarily aspiration pneumonia and catheter-associated bacteremia\u2014as well as urinary tract infections [3]. The members are characteristically Gram-negative, oxidase-negative, strictly aerobic, and non-fermenting coccobacillus cells that occur in pairs under magnification [4] and exhibit twitching motility [5].

BLASTn and EzBi\u00b0loud searches revealed that strain B301 had the highest sequence similarities with A. celticus ANC 4603 and A. sichuanensis WCHAc060041 (97.12%), and A. piscicola LW15 (96.92%). The observed 16S rRNA sequence similarity were below the proposed species boundary of 98.7% [36]. Phylogenetic tree reconstructed by the neighbor-joining tree and compared with the maximum-likelihood algorithm (Fig. 1) revealed that strain B301 forms a distinct clade with A. gandensis UG 60467, with a neighboring clade composed of A. bohemicus ANC 3994 and A. celticus ANC 4603.

There were 2,840 protein-coding genes and 102 RNA genes (21 rRNA genes and 81 tRNA genes). The DNA G+C content of strain B301 was 37.0% which is within the range (34.9\u201347.0%) reported for members of Acinetobacter [2, 6]. Genomic comparison of the ANI and dDDH data between strain B301 and closely related species (Tables S1), A. equi 114 (ANI: 78.7%, dDDH: 22.3%), A. celticus CCUG 69239 (ANI: 78.2%, dDDH: 23.0%), and A. cumulans WCHAc060092 (ANI: 77.8%, dDDH: 23.0%), revealed that the values were significantly lower than the threshold for species delineation, which is 95\u201396% and 70%, respectively [37]. The phylogenomic tree is presented as supplementary data (Fig. S1). Strain B301 was observed as Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, non-motile, oxidase-negative, and catalase-positive. Transmission electron micrographs showed a coccobacillus-shaped cell of approximately 1.5 \u03bcm in length and 0.77 \u03bcm in diameter with no appendages (Fig. S2). Growth was observed on TSA at 25\u201330\u00b0C and pH 6.0\u20139.0, with optimal growth at 30\u00b0C and pH 7.0. The isolate does not require NaCl for growth but was able to tolerate 2.0% (w\/v) NaCl supplemented in TSB. Table 1 presents the phenotypic characteristics of strain B301 compared with the reference strains. Moreover, Strain B301 was not able to hydrolyze Tween 20, Tween 80, or gelatin, whereas the reference strains tested positive in at least one hydrolysis test.

[38] The major respiratory quinones present in strain B301 were Q-9 (83.0%), Q-8 (13.0%), and Q-10 (4.0%), consistent with those of Acinetobacter piscicola LW15 and A. equi 114 [33]. The primary polar lipid of strain B301 was phosphatidylethanolamine, along with diphosphatidyl-glycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and phospha-tidylserine. Moreover, an unidentified aminophospholipid, was detected as a minor polar lipid (Fig. S3). The major cellular fatty acids of strain B301 consist of summed feature 3 (C16:1 \u03c96c\/C16:1 \u03c97c, 47.67%), C16:0 (22.19%), and C18:1 \u03c99c (7.95%), as presented in Table 2. Strain B301 showed higher proportions of summed feature 3 and saturated fatty acids C16:0 and C14:0 than the reference strains.

Results of the RGI software analysis revealed that strain B301 possesses no antibiotic-resistance gene (Table S2). The absence of OXA-133, AAC(3)-IIb, tet(39), and RlmA(II) indicates susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, tetracycline, and macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics. The Kirby\u2013Bauer disk-diffusion assay showed that strain B301 was highly susceptible to all antimicrobials used, with the highest zones of inhibition for imipenem (40.0 mm), minocycline (35.0 mm), and cefepime (34.0 mm), and the smallest for ciprofloxacin (26.0 mm). The DNA G+C content, and the respiratory quinone, fatty acid, and polar lipid profiles of strain B301 supported the assignment of the strain to the genus Acinetobacter. Distinguishing phenotypic, biochemical, and chemotaxonomic properties, highlighted in the phylogenetic placement as well as low levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities and genomic indexes with other related species, suggest that strain B301 represents a novel species, for which the name Acinetobacter pullorum B301 is proposed. Acinetobacter pullorum (pul.lo\u2019rum. L. gen. pl. n. pullorum of chickens). Cells of strain B301 are Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, and non-motile coccobacilli that are approximately 1.5 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.77 \u03bcm in size, and are oxidase-negative, and catalase-positive. Colonies are convex, smooth, cream-colored, and circular with an entire margin of approximately 1.0\u20132.0 mm in diameter on TSA after 2 days of incubation at 30\u00b0C. The strain grows at 0\u20132.0% (w\/v) NaCl (optimum, 0%), in a temperature range of 25\u2013 35\u00b0C (optimum, 30\u00b0C) and a pH range of 6.0\u20139.0 (optimum, pH 7.0). Respiration occurs under strict aerobic conditions. The isolate shows no hydrolysis activity. Cells assimilate \u03b2-alanine, citrate, glycogen, L-histidine, D-malate, L-proline, and valerate but not capric acid, 4-hydroxybenzoate, malonate, and propionic acid. The major respiratory quinone is Q-9. The cellular fatty acids are summed feature 3 (C16:1 \u03c96c\/C16:1 \u03c97c, 47.67%), C16:0 (22.19%), and C18:1 \u03c99c (7.95%). The major polar lipids are phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidyl-glycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine. Strain B301 possesses no antibiotic-resistance gene profile (OXA-133, AAC(3)-IIb, tet(39), and RlmA(II)) and is highly susceptible to a wide range of antimicrobials, including imipenem, minocycline, cefepime, ampicillin, and tetracycline.

Leptotrichia spp have been implicated in a variety of human infections, including animal bite wounds, bloodstream infections, and hepatic abscesses (Eribe and Olsen 2017). Although bacteremia and endocarditis caused by Leptotrichia spp are considered uncommon, in a retrospective analysis, three of 39 bacteremia cases (7.7%) caused by anaerobic bacteria among patients with hematologic neoplasms were due to Leptotrichia spp (Blairon et al. 2006). L. goodfellowii infections have primarily been reported in immunocompetent patients, including all five previously reported cases of endocarditis caused by that organism (Hammann et al. 1993; Caram et al. 2008; Lim et al. 2016; Matias et al. 2016). Similar to other causes of bacterial endocarditis, important risk factors for Leptotrichia spp endocarditis include valvular pathology, presence of a prosthetic valve and mucosal lesions including periodontitis (Duperval et al. 1984; Hammann et al. 1993; Caram et al. 2008; Eribe and Olsen 2008; Matias et al. 2016). Most cases of L. goodfellowii endocarditis have been subacute, usually presenting after 2\u20133 mo of symptoms including fevers and fatigue (Caram et al. 2008; Matias et al. 2016), although a case of acute endocarditis evolving over 1 wk has also been reported (Caram et al. 2008). To our knowledge, few fatal cases of Leptotrichia infection have been described and all previously reported cases of L. goodfellowii endocarditis have been successfully treated with antibiotics, with or without valve replacement (Hammann et al. 1993; Caram et al. 2008; Matias et al. 2016). Antibiotic sensitivities have not been explored in all cases of L. goodfellowii infection, but existing data support low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to penicillins, most cephalosporins, vancomycin, and clindamycin (Hammann et al. 1993; Caram et al. 2008; Lim et al. 2016). Even when L. goodfellowii grows in culture, identification in the clinical laboratory can be challenging and may not be successfully accomplished by phenotypic methods or matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Lim et al. 2016). Therefore, molecular identification using broad-range 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and subsequent Sanger sequencing is a critical diagnostic method for definitive identification for this organism (Caram et al. 2008; Lim et al. 2016; Matias et al. 2016). Molecular methods are important adjunct diagnostic tools for evaluating infective endocarditis (IE) particularly when cultures are negative (Maneg et al. 2016; Liesman et al. 2017), as in the current case. This approach typically requires DNA predominantly from a single species, with minimal interfering templates (Salipante et al. 2013). Because of these limitations, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is emerging as a valuable tool for identifying pathogens in polymicrobial specimens (Cummings et al. 2016). In this case report, we present an important application of NGS: resolution of bacterial 16S rDNA in a monomicrobial infection from a background of contaminating DNA that was nonspecifically amplified from patient tissue. The definitive identification of L. goodfellowii as the etiologic agent in culture-negative endocarditis by this approach highlights the pathogenicity of this organism in immunocompetent patients."}]}]},{"species":"Legionella micdadei","docs":[{"title":"Legionella micdadei Aquaticum Infection: a Case Report and Literature Review","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Legionella micdadei cause?","id":"303-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"pulmonary infection","answer_start":511,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Legionella micdadei sensitive to?","id":"303-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"moxi-floxacin","answer_start":583,"id":1},{"text":"azithromycin, erythromycin or levofloxacin","answer_start":889,"id":2},{"text":"azithromycin, erythromycin or levofloxacin","answer_start":1149,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"  Background:  The goal of the study was to analyze the clinical characteristics of Legionella cases caused by Legionella micdadei and explore the diagnosis and treatment.

The patient, a 59-year-old gentleman, presented with fever, weakness, dizziness, presyncope, and an intermittent nonproductive cough over the preceding 2 months. On history, he denied any headache, nausea, vomiting, or significant recent travel. He was empirically treated for an undefined infectious process with 1 g of intravenous (i.v.) ceftriaxone daily. The patient had known Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, an indolent B-cell lymphoma. Six weeks prior to his initial presentation, he had completed a 6-month course of chemotherapy with an anti-CD20 agent (rituximab) and a DNA synthesis inhibitor (fludarabine). Five days after initiation of empirical ceftriaxone, the patient presented again to an emergency department with recurrent falls, aphasia, confusion, and hallucinations. He had a decreased level of consciousness and new gastrointestinal symptoms in the form of nausea and vomiting. On examination, the patient was afebrile, with a Glasgow coma score of 14\/15, and displayed mild left-sided weakness involving upper and lower extremities. The initial investigation included a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head that showed a large right frontal lobe mass with significant mass effect. At that time, neoplasm was high on the differential, and the patient was started on dexamethasone 24 mg\/day i.v. and dilantin 200 mg\/day i.v. He was then transferred to a tertiary care center. An urgent magnetic resonance image (MRI) scanning report noted the presence of a solitary, cystic\/necrotic, right frontal lobe lesion suggestive of a brain abscess. The lesion had approximate dimensions of 6.4 by 5 by 5 cm and was associated with significant vasogenic edema (Fig. 1A). Eight days after his first visit to the emergency department, the patient underwent craniotomy with partial excision and drainage of an early encapsulated, frankly purulent abscess. Empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated and included 2 g\/day i.v. ceftriaxone, 4.5 g\/day i.v. vancomycin, and 1 g\/day i.v. metronidazole with 24 mg\/day i.v. adjuvant dexamethasone. On initial Gram stain of the abscess fluid, only polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes were reported. The abscess fluid was culture negative for bacteria after 7 days of incubation on sheep blood agar, chocolate agar (CO2 incubation at 37\u00b0C), brain heart infusion broth, and phenylethyl alcohol blood agar (anaerobic incubation at 37\u00b0C). An aliquot of the direct specimen, abscess fluid, was sent for universal 16S rRNA PCR and amplicon sequencing. Pending the results of the PCR, ciprofloxacin, 800 mg i.v. daily, was added to broaden the antimicrobial coverage. Investigations also included multiple blood culture sets (BD Bactec FX, paired aerobic and anaerobic bottles), with all reported as \u201cNo growth after 5 days of incubation.\u201d Serology for histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, toxoplasmosis, amoebiasis, and cryptococcal antigen were reported negative. Despite empirical antibiotics, steroids, and surgical intervention, the patient continued to deteriorate and died of an axial herniation 10 days after admission.

Given the environmental distribution of the unusual organism identified, and the direct method used, confirmation of the pathogenic role of this organism was needed. A subsequent review of the initial abscess fluid Gram stain, after extended counterstaining time with safranin, demonstrated faintly staining intra- and extracellular Gram-negative bacilli. An autopsy was conducted to clarify the cause of death and attempt to identify the source of infection. Specimens were sampled from lungs, heart valves, kidney, liver, and central nervous system (CNS; cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], brain tissue, and abscess fluid). Correlating with the MRI findings, examination of the brain at autopsy disclosed an abscess cavity deep in the right frontal white matter (Fig. 1B). Microscopic examination of the abscess revealed rudimentary formation of a capsule, consisting of rows of proliferating blood vessels and scattered macrophages along the interface with the fibrinopurulent exudate. Tissue Gram stain failed to demonstrate microorganisms, but Warthin-Starry stains showed an abundance of rod-shaped bacteria in the exudate (Fig. 1C and \u200bandDD). Considering the 16S rRNA results, premortem abscess fluid and autopsy specimens were planted on in-house-prepared buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE-\u03b1; ketoglutarate supplemented) agar. L. micdadei (>100 colonies) was isolated by culture after 72 h of incubation (O2, high humidity) from premortem abscess fluid and from brain abscess tissue, abscess fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid taken at the autopsy. The identification was confirmed by fatty acid analysis (MIDI) and 16S rRNA. Autopsy specimens from the lungs, heart valves, urine, and kidney were negative for Legionella by culture. Blood cultures were not available for subculture on BCYE. A single serologic test for Legionella (CDC in-house-derived protocol) was negative from serum taken the day following the craniotomy. Of note, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) was also isolated from postmortem lung tissue. Legionellaceae species are fastidious, facultatively intracellular Gram-negative bacilli which fail to grow on the majority of standard media routinely used in clinical laboratories (1). Culture on specialized charcoal agar medium remains the gold standard for diagnosis of any form of Legionella infection. Clinical laboratories often rely on antigenuria, direct fluorescence antibody staining (DFA), serology, and molecular amplification to make the diagnosis. Except for the latter, these tests are somewhat more specific for L. pneumophila serotype 1 (2). Legionella infections are generally associated with pneumonia or other respiratory tract infection. Extrapulmonary infections without lung involvement are rare (3). Systemic involvement, exhibited as renal impairment, cardiac manifestations, as well as gastrointestinal or neurological symptoms, can also occur (4). Early after the description of Legionnaires' disease, several case reports, as reviewed by Johnson et al. (4), documented a greater-than-expected associated frequency of neurological signs and symptoms in an estimated 40 to 50% of patients. The described neurological disorders ranged from nonspecific alterations in the sensorium, including coma, to specific cerebellar dysfunction and an assortment of focal signs. However, an infective etiology for these associated neurologic conditions has evaded detection. In an autopsy-neuropathology study of 40 patients dying with Legionella pneumonia, 40% of whom had a neurologic disorder; Pendlebury et al. (5) were unable to attribute the cause to direct infection of the CNS. Therefore, it has been proposed that these neurological disturbances are due to either the effect of neurotoxins or immune-mediated mechanisms (5, 6). In regard to the latter mechanism, rare case reports of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis have been documented in the setting of Legionnaires' disease (4, 7\u20139). Problematic in assessment are cases reported in the literature (4, 9\u201311), in which Legionella has been identified in CNS tissue or CSF by means other than culture (specific staining techniques, DFA, PCR) and for which there has been no clinical, radiological, or pathological correlation of infection. This difficulty may reflect the sensitivity of the diagnostic tools employed and the fastidious requirements of the organism for culture. Table 1 summarizes the reported cases of confirmed Legionella sp. central nervous system infection. Summary of case reports of Legionella sp. confirmed central nervous system infection described in the literature More than 90% of infectious Legionella isolates are L. pneumophila, while 60% of the remaining are attributed to L. micdadei and often affect immunocompromised patients (15). A PubMed search with the keywords \u201cL. micdadei\u201d and \u201cbrain abscess\u201d produced only one case report. Fukuta et al. described a prosthetic valve endocarditis in a patient on immunosuppressive therapy for systemic lupus erythematosis complicated by L. micdadei brain abscess (14). As in our case, L. micdadei was detected with 16S rRNA PCR, and the organism was also visualized in the brain abscess exudate with a Warthin-Starry stain. Fukuta et al. however, did not isolate the organism by any culture method. Brain infection attributed to other Legionella species, specifically L. pneumophila and L. cincinnatiensis, have also been reported, although, again, the organism was never grown in culture (4, 10, 12, 13). L. micdadei has been identified in other infections, including prosthetic joint infections, lung abscesses, and necrotizing cellulitis (3), as well as in soft tissue abscesses, often in association with acquired or congenital immunosuppression (12, 16, 17). The wide distribution of Legionella spp. in the environment complicates its identification as a pathogen, because the source and transmission route may be difficult to define. Our patient was immunocompromised and thus at risk for non-pneumophila legionellosis. It is possible that the patient's initial respiratory symptoms may have been due to L. micdadei pneumonia (\u201cPittsburgh pneumonia\u201d) or MAC infection, although the admission chest X ray had no evidence of pneumonia. The low prevalence of legionellosis in Alberta, Canada; the ubiquitous nature of this organism; and the paucity of literature describing this agent as a cause of brain abscess led us to question the 16S rRNA results. Furthermore, recent reports have described Legionella spp. as possible contaminants of DNA extraction columns (18). The autopsy failed to identify any specific focus of infection aside from the brain. We were unable to identify, on history, the origin of the infection, as the patient's family denied risk factors such as recent whirlpool use or travel. Despite diagnostic and pharmacological advances, bacterial brain abscesses remain associated with a high morbidity and significant mortality (19\u201321). Detection and identification of causal agents is critical to direct therapy, although approximately two-thirds of brain abscesses have \u201cnegative\u201d cultures. 16S rRNA gene sequencing may serve as an important identification tool when pathological findings and Gram stains suggest bacterial abscess, but attempts to isolate the organism by culture have failed (22, 23). As illustrated by this case, culture-negative brain abscess represents a clinical management challenge and, in such circumstances, 16S rRNA gene sequencing can be a useful adjunct test. It may also help identify agents not typically considered causes of brain abscess. Nonetheless, as with all new technologies, caution is required when interpreting the clinical significance of 16S rRNA results. In summary, we describe the first case to our knowledge of an isolated brain abscess due to L. micdadei in an immunocompromised patient, diagnosed by culture and 16S rRNA sequencing of a direct specimen. This adds to the scant literature regarding this manifestation of Legionella infection and demonstrates how recent technologies can assist the clinician to better direct antimicrobial therapy."}]}]},{"species":"Actinomyces meyeri","docs":[{"title":"Actinomyces meyeri infection: case report and review of the literature","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Actinomyces meyeri cause?","id":"304-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"actinomycosis","answer_start":44,"id":1},{"text":"pneumonia and empyema","answer_start":85,"id":2},{"text":"pulmonary infection","answer_start":510,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are A. meyeri sensitive to?","id":"304-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"penicillin","answer_start":240,"id":1},{"text":"penicillin","answer_start":610,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Actinomyces meyeri is an uncommon cause of actinomycosis.

In this report, we present a 35-year-old male patient who experienced an insidious headache and left-sided weakness and was diagnosed with an Actinomyces meyeri brain abscess. A 35-year-old Nepalese man came to our institute with the primary complaint of insidious onset of headache and left-sided weakness.

Cardiac examination revealed systolic murmur with regular S1 and S2, and lung examination was normal. The patient had poor dental hygiene. Biochemistry and haematology panel were normal. Urinalysis, chest X-ray and electrocardiogram revealed no abnormality. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mitral regurgitation. However, there was no evidence of valvular vegetation. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed, which showed a bi-lobed rim enhancing lesion with a conglomeration of two adjoining round lesions in the right parietal parasagittal region. Perilesional oedema resulting in mass effect over the right lateral ventricle and mid-right uncal herniation with midline shift was noted. Craniotomy was performed, and the lesion was excised.

It begins as a localized area of cerebritis and develops into an encapsulated collection of pustular material, often presenting as a mass-like lesion. Brain abscesses usually result from the spread of infection from adjacent otitis media, mastoiditis and sinusitis, or hematogenous spread from infective endocarditis, pneumonia, empyema, skin infections, liver abscess, and pelvic infections [1]. Currently, brain abscesses are rare in high-income countries, partly due to the reduction of abscesses complicating otogenic infections [2]. It is increasingly recognized in certain risk groups, including those with congenital heart disease, diabetes, alcoholics, those who have had neurosurgery or head trauma and the use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive conditions [2\u20134]. Mortality from brain abscesses continues to decline with the introduction of CT, minimally invasive stereotactic-guided aspiration, and newer antimicrobials with good central nervous system (CNS) penetration [1]. The spectrum of pathogens responsible for brain abscess varies depending on the mechanism of infection, the host\u2019s immune status and local epidemiology. Streptococcus species are the most commonly identified organisms in brain abscesses, followed by anaerobes, especially when it is due to spread from contiguous site. Anaerobic infections are mainly caused by the species Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, Peptococcus and Veillonella. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are often isolated from postoperative brain abscesses. However, up to 50% or more of brain abscesses are polymicrobial [2, 4, 5]. In immunocompromised populations, Nocardia species are responsible for most cases [4, 5]. In the medical literature, there are only a few reported cases of brain abscess caused by Actinomyces meyeri.

The genus Actinomyces contains strictly anaerobic, non-acid-resistant, gram-positive bacilli \/ coccobacilli. An indolent course characterizes their infectious behaviour, the formation of abscesses with a woody consistency, the presence of sulfur granules and the development of a draining sinus or tract [6]. Actinomyces meyeri was first isolated in 1911 by Kurt F. Meyer from a sample of empyema. Till date, only about 30 cases have been recorded in the medical literature. Actinomyces meyeri brain abscess is even rarer; only 8 cases have been reported in the medical literature [7]. Depending on the location affected, actinomycosis is categorized as an oro-cervicofacial, thoracic, or abdominopelvic disease. Less commonly, actinomycosis can affect other parts of the body, including the musculoskeletal system, pericardium, and central nervous system [6]. Poor oral hygiene, dental procedures, aspiration of oral contents, abdominal surgery, and acute abdominal processes are identified as risk factors for actinomycosis [6, 7]. Actinomyces is particularly known for its ability to cross tissue planes [6]. Cerebral disease, i.e. brain abscesses, is a sporadic and most severe form of actinomycosis and manifests itself as abscesses of the occipital or parietal brain due to direct expansion from a contiguous site (oral cavity). However, little is known about the virulence factors that allow Actinomyces to penetrate tissues in this way [7, 8]. In our case, brain abscess was likely due to spread of Actinomyces meyeri from oral cavity to brain parenchyma. The oral cavity harbors more than 500 bacterial species. Just 1 mg of dental plaque may contain more than 10 microorganisms. Most oral microorganisms are harmless, but if the patient\u2019s overall health condition is weakened, even low-virulence bacteria may become harmful [9]. Odontogenic infections can cause brain abscesses in a variety of ways: 1) direct extension; 2) hematogenous spread; 3) lymphatic spread [9]. It is assumed that actinomyces can cause brain abscesses by direct extension [6]. A suppurative cellulitis in oral cavity can spread along the fascia1 planes to the base of the skull, the paranasal sinuses, and the orbit. Eventually, the cranial wall is penetrated by resorption of bone or the microorganisms pass through the many foramina present, causing a brain abscess [9]. The histopathological diagnosis of actinomycosis is difficult because tissue samples usually contain few sulfur granules. Also, sulfur granules may be present in nocardiosis, coccidioidomycosis, and aspergillosis [10]. Gram stain of the excised sample reveals gram variable filamentous rods. Therefore, it should be distinguished from Nocardia and Streptomyces. On an anaerobic culture, Actinomyces meyeri forms creamy-white, moist, confluent colonies on chocolate agar. However, cultures are negative in more than 50% of cases [10]. If culture is negative, the infection should be confirmed by other non-culture technique. In our study, we determined Actinomyces meyeri using MALDI-TOF [11]. If actinomyces are suspected, we recommend using MALDI-TOF instead of traditional microbiological methods. A new molecular genetic technology (massive parallel sequencing technology) using the universal amplification of bacterial 16S rRNA genes has shown that only a small percentage of bacteria present in bacterial brain abscesses can be identified by culture [12]. Traditional methods cannot detect smaller subgroups of multi-species communities present in bacterial brain abscesses. Besides, species related to the maintenance and expansion of abscesses may be missed during pus aspiration because they are mainly present near the abscess wall and not in the pus obtained by aspiration [12]. However, massive parallel sequencing technologies can characterize complex microbial communities. Kommedal et al. has found that massive parallel sequencing technology can improve the detection rate of Actinomyces species, including A. meyeri, compared to culture [10]. Conventional therapy for actinomycetal infections includes intravenous penicillin for 2\u20136 weeks, then oral penicillin or amoxicillin for an extended period of 6 to 12 months. In cases of penicillin allergy, erythromycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline and clindamycin are an alternative. However, the central nervous system permeability of all the antibiotics mentioned above is variable [7, 10]. Surgical treatment is essential for the treatment of actinomyces brain abscesses. It helps identify pathogens and their susceptibility, reduces bacterial load and surrounding stress, prevents hernias, increases oxygen tension in diseased tissue, and promotes penetration of antibiotics [7]. A previous case report of Actinomyces israelii brain abscess has mentioned that the aspiration of brain abscess using burr hole technique facilitate the penetration of antibiotics into the abscess cavity and may shorten the course of antibiotic therapy [8]. In our case, the surgical team opted to perform a craniotomy and excision due to right uncal herniation and midline shift and to seek a microbiological diagnosis to administer targeted antimicrobial therapy. We also chose to treat for a longer duration due to issues with follow up. However, a short course of antibiotic therapy may have been enough based on previous experience [8]. Actinomycosis may represent in many countries a challenge for specific diagnosis [12], even more in cases like this, where is presenting as a brain abscess secondary to poor dental hygiene. In conclusion, Actinomyces should be considered in the differential diagnosis of brain abscess in patients with poor dental hygiene, and early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can lead to better results."}]},{"title":"A Case of Disseminated Infection due to Actinomyces meyeri Involving Lung and Brain","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can A. meyeri cause?","id":"304-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"disseminated disease","answer_start":314,"id":1},{"text":"pulmonary actinomycosis with brain abscess","answer_start":528,"id":2},{"text":"pulmonary infection","answer_start":371,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are A. meyeri sensitive to?","id":"304-3-1-2","answers":[{"text":"penicillin-based regimen","answer_start":395,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Actinomyces meyeri is rarely isolated in cases of actinomycosis.

Most actinomycotic infections are polymicrobic and include other anaerobic or microaerophilic flora such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp. [2]. These associated pathogens also belong to the human oropharyngeal flora. Hypothetical mechanisms by which associated bacteria may enhance the pathogenicity of Actinomyces species include reduced oxygen tension and anaerobiosis-induced inhibition of phagocytes [3]. Pulmonary infections are believed to occur due to aspiration of the organism from the oral cavity. In our case, A. meyeri infection involved the lung and brain. In addition, polymicrobial organisms, including Propionibacterium acnes and Fusobacterium nucleatum, were cultured from the brain abscess. Even though the patient had smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for 20 years, he did not have poor dental hygiene, nor did he drink alcohol heavily. A. meyeri is a rare cause of actinomycosis in humans. It was first isolated from a patient with empyema by Meyer in 1911, who termed it Streptothrix. The microorganism was reclassified as Actinobacterium meyeri in 1938. The nomenclature was changed to Actinobacterium meyeri by Prevot in 1956 and subsequently to A. meyeri by Holderman in 1977 [13]. Although actinomycosis by A. meyeri was discovered more than 100 years ago, it has been accepted that members of the genus Actinomyces are difficult to accurately identify down to the species [14]. Historically, classification of Actinomyces species was based upon differentiation in a few phenotypic tests [15]. Biochemical reactions, colonial morphology, and gas-liquid chromatography were used to identify Actinomyces species. Recent advances in microbiological identification techniques, particularly 16S rRNA sequencing, have been used successfully to identify new Actinomyces species such as A. meyeri, A. europaeus, A. neuii, A. radingae, A. graevenitzii, A. turicensis, A. georgiae, A. funkei, A. lingnae, A. houstonesis and A. cardiffensis, which are also reported as human pathogens [1]. Actinomycosis of the central nervous system is rare. The source may be hematogenous, or it may develop through extension of oral-cervicofacial disease. In our case, the patient did not have poor dental hygiene, nor did he have oral-cervicofacial disease. Therefore, brain abscess caused by A. meyeri might have been from hematogenous spread. Unlike A. israelii, which predominantly causes cervicofacial disease, the most common organ system involved by A. meyeri is pulmonary [1]. A. meyeri often causes disseminated disease, which can arise secondarily to frequent pulmonary infections [1]. According to one study, of 26 cases of A. meyeri. infection, 10 (38%) were disseminated (defined as the involvement of two or more distant organs) [3]. The propensity of A. meyeri to disseminate is difficult to explain because this organism does not differ from other actinomycetes in its microbiological characteristics [3]. It has been postulated that pulmonary infection is often the source of hematogenous dissemination [16], and this assumption is supported by the observation that in eight out of 10 cases of disseminated actinomycosis due to A. meyeri, pulmonary infection was present [3]. In the case reported here, it is presumed that hematogenous spread from the pulmonary lesions which led to disseminated actinomycosis with brain abscesses that were initially misdiagnosed as a metastatic tumor. Also, the finding that lung lesion had showed good response to penicillin treatment suggests that lung lesion be caused by A. meyeri. Compared to the cases of disseminated actinomycosis due to A. meyeri that have been reported abroad [2, 3, 4, 5], only few cases of cerebral actinomycosis presenting as brain abscess have been reported in Korea [6, 7, 8]. With the exception of the first Korean report of a brain abscess caused by A. meyeri [6], all Korean cerebral actinomycosis cases were confirmed by the presence of sulfur granules on biopsy, which is a typical finding associated with actinomycosis [7, 8]. To our knowledge, this is the first report of disseminated A. meyeri infection. Treatment of most patients with actinomycosis infection involves a prolonged course of antibiotics, accompanied by surgical or percutaneous drainage when indicated. Similar to other Actinomyces species, A. meyeri remains susceptible to several antibiotic classes. Penicillin continues to be the drug of choice for Actinomyces spp., including A. meyeri. Other antibiotics that have good in vitro activity and that have been used extensively with favorable clinical outcomes include erythromycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, and clindamycin. For localized disease, especially in the cervicofacial region, a relatively short course of oral penicillin (500 mg - 1 g q 6 h) for two months seems adequate [12]. For more extensive and disseminated disease, current expert opinion suggests intravenous penicillin (18-24 million units per day) for a period of two to six weeks, followed by oral penicillin or amoxicillin (500 mg q 6 h) [17]. The recommended duration of antibiotics therapy is six to twelve months, but this must be individualized based on the patient's clinical and radiologic response. The prognosis was favorable, even in patients with disseminated disease, including the brain [1]. In our case, the patient had undergone stereotatic aspiration of brain abscess, and he had received a 6-week course of penicillin G (4 million units q 4 h) and metronidazole (500 mg q 8 h) intravenously for A. meyeri and isolated anaerobes. After being discharged from the hospital, he was scheduled to complete a 12-month course of oral amoxicillin (500 mg q 4 h). At his five-month follow-up, he reported that his neurological symptoms resolved completely, and follow-up radiographs showed a marked decrease in the size of the lung nodules and brain lesion. A case initially presumed as lung cancer with brain metastasis in a patient who presented with headache and aphasia was confirmed as an uncommon disseminated infection due to A. meyeri, which was accurately identified by 16S rRNA sequencing. Through surgical drainage of brain abscess and a 12-month, penicillin-based antibiotic regimen, the patient recovered completely. Disseminated infections with A. meyeri have rarely been reported in Korea. Here, we report a case of pulmonary actinomycosis with brain abscess caused by A. meyeri that was confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing."}]},{"title":"Actinomyces Meyeri Empyema Necessitatis-A Case Report and Review of the Literature","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Actinomyces meyeri cause?","id":"304-4-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Pleural empyema necessitatis","answer_start":1,"id":1},{"text":"empyema necessitans","answer_start":188,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Pleural empyema necessitatis caused by Actinomyces meyeri is a rare but severe infection. A. species predominantly A. meyeri and A. israelii represent the second most common pathogen for empyema necessitans after mycobacteria. The incidence is reported in the literature to be 1:300,000. Men are thrice more likely to be affected than women. Pathogenetically, an infection can be triggered by aspiration in immunocompromised individuals which leads to an atelectasis with pneumonitis.  In two cases, a 38-year-old construction worker and a 61-year-old woman with ulcerative breast carcinoma, who presented to the local emergency department with a painful swelling of the left chest, diagnostic workup revealed a pleural empyema necessitatis of the left chest. An antibiotic treatment was initiated with piperacillin\/tazobactam and sulbactam\/ampicillin, respectively. Temporally vacuum-dressing therapy was initiated after surgical debridement. In the course of the procedure, a reconstruction of tissue damage was feasible. The patients were recovered completely and discharged with an oral antibiotic treatment (amoxicillin) for 6 and 12 months, respectively.  Thoracic actinomycosis is a relatively uncommon and traditionally chronic, indolent infection secondary to pulmonary infection with A. species .

Surgical intervention is also the treatment of choice for the rare complication of extended local infection through the chest wall known as empyema necessitatis.  On one hand the etiology of empyema and, particularly, the causative organism has almost no impact on the initial performed surgical intervention of infected tissue excision. On the other hand, for the further postoperative treatment, especially type and duration of antibiotics, knowledge of the causal agent is crucial. Actinomyces meyeri is a filamentous, gram-positive anaerobic bacterium that can be found physiologically in the normal flora of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract and is rarely pathological.

Actinomycosis certainly represents one of these entities. The actinomyces bacteria family are filamentous gram-positive, rod shaped anaerobic cells including many species and normally reside as concomitant inhabitants in the human oropharyngeal tract.  They can act as opportunistic pathogens and cause infect when the mucosal barrier is disrupted, for example, due to structural diseases or concomitant infections, such as dental infections. A. species can migrate into deeper structures and cause infection.  In most cases, chronic cervicofascial infection also known as \u201clumpy jaw\u201d is the result and A. israelii is detected.  There are few data about the frequency of actinomycosis. An incidence of 1 per 300,000 was estimated in 1970.  Probably with improvement in dental hygiene and use of antibiotics the incidence dropped further in developed countries.   During the review of literature we found six cases of empyema caused by A. israelii       and further six cases of empyema due to A. meyeri .         Clinical appearance is nonspecific and includes fever, weight loss, productive cough, and chest pain. From a radiological and clinical point of view, it can be confused with neoplasia, for example, lung cancer. The final diagnosis is often made by bronchoscopic or percutaneous needle aspiration. The detection of pathogens is usually better microscopically (direct preparation and gram staining) than culturally. It has to be considered that the Actinomyces are very difficult to grow (anaerobic\/microaerophilic incubation up to 14 days). Detection and confirmation by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) are reliable but seldom performed, as one has to think about Actinomyces . In our cases, culture and PCR on drainage fluid resulted in no evidence of Actinomyces but microbiological culture of tissue detected A. meyeri . If actinomycosis infections of the pleura and thoracic wall with or without existing cutaneous fistula are suspected, it is advisable to provide tissue samples for the microbiologist and pathologist. PCR (specific nucleic acid detection) is also possible. Radiologic presentation is variable and unspecific so in most cases it does not contribute to the exact diagnosis.  Histopathological examination can reveal filamentous structures mimicking fungal growth. Furthermore, sulfur granules and granuloma can be detected, such as in infection with Nocardia , coccygea, or aspergilla, which leads to a challenging differentiation.    Surgical therapy in complicated thoracic infections, especially in empyema, is the treatment of choice providing rapid focus control and, thus, should be initiated when conservative treatment fails, or infection extends. Additionally, adapted antibiotic therapy is required.  For most cases with actinomycosis, due to the high susceptibility of these germs to penicillin, prolonged antibiotic therapy (up to 12 months) without surgery is sufficient. The duration of treatment remains a matter of debate as reliable evidence to support decision is lacking.  Most authors agree that a too-short course of antibiotics render a higher risk of relapse and that initial IV therapy over 4 to 6 weeks is mandatory. In thoracic actinomycosis shorter antibiotic regimes (< 3 months) were performed with equally high cure rates especially in patients receiving concomitant surgical treatment for control of the mean infection focus.  In our opinion, the treatment duration has to be individualized and discussed interdisciplinary. The main requirement to terminate antibiotics is a complete resolution of the infiltrates or persistent stabilization of residual lesions (scar) documented by CT scan. Additionally, periodic clinical examinations and blood chemistry are recommended to early identify side effects potentially associated with long-term antibiotic therapy.   Penicillin is the substance of choice; with penicillin V administered three to four times daily due to its kinetics, which can decrease the compliance with the treatment. So, amoxicillin is an alternative with two doses a day. For pregnant or penicillin-allergic patients, tetracycline and erythromycin provide an option.  Additionally, the dental status and oral hygiene of the patient should be checked and remediated if required.   Surgery for thoracic actinomycosis is used mostly for diagnostic purposes, especially to rule out malignancy or as a therapeutic adjunct in cases with complications as empyema, chest wall fistula, or hemoptysis. In our cases, surgical debridement of the abscess cavity without resection of underlying structures and a short course of vacuum wound dressing allowed a rapid decrease of the initial lesion and an excellent and durable closure of the chest wall fistula. Antibiotic therapy remains the cornerstone of successful treatment.  Empyema necessitatis due to unspecific empyema is a very rare entity leaving tuberculosis (mycobacteria), actinomycosis and malignancies as the most frequent differential diagnosis for fistulating diseases of the chest wall. Differentiation between these entities can be challenging.  We suggest actinomycosis should be kept in mind. Despite the causative organism does not play any role for initial surgical treatment gathering of samples at that point of time including tissue and liquid samples for diagnostics is crucial for the patient and the continuative therapy. With this strategy, an early diagnosis is possible and may provide the necessary information for the right therapy and may spare the patient from unnecessary isolation and extensive surgery.

G. bergeri is a part of the normal flora of the oral cavity and upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Nevertheless, there have been no reports of mediastinal abscess caused by G. bergeri in the literature. Furthermore, the conventional biochemical methods may lead to misidentification. Regarding the first point, there have been few reports of mediastinal abscess or mediastinitis caused by Gemella species in the literature. Most cases of mediastinal abscess occur as a complication following surgery, trauma, esophageal perforation (e.g., Boerhaave's syndrome), or the development of cervical infections (e.g., descending cervical mediastinitis). The most common causative microorganism in mediastinitis following thoracic surgery is S. aureus (13). In contrast, there have been only three case reports of mediastinitis caused by G. morbillorum (14-16), and no cases caused by G. bergeri have been reported. Regarding the second point, the conventional biochemical methods may result in misidentification. However, MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing may be useful for the diagnosis of G. bergeri (3). To date, there have been 15 case reports of G. bergeri infections (2-11). Two reports did not mention how to identify the microorganisms. Of the remaining 13 cases, 8 were diagnosed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 2 were diagnosed by MALDI-TOF MS or MALDI-TOF MS+16S rRNA gene sequencing, 2 were diagnosed by conventional biochemical methods, and the last was diagnosed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. In brief, 10 of the 13 patients were diagnosed by MALDI-TOF MS or 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In our patient, the VITEK II system (bioM\u00e9rieux) and BD BBL Crystal GP (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, USA) indicated an \u201cUnidentified organism\u201d. This strain was identified as G. haemolysans by API 20 strep v.8.0 (%ID 64.2, T index 0.97; bioM\u00e9rieux) and Rapid ID 32 strep v.4.0 (%ID 93.4, T index 0.73; bioM\u00e9rieux) with low discrimination. It was identified as G. bergeri with a confidence value of 99.9 by MALDI-TOF MS (VITEK MS; bioM\u00e9rieux) and confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the GenBank Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/genbank\/) (Identities 1,397\/1,397, Gaps 0\/1,397, Score 2,580bits) (Fig. 4). Consequently, we diagnosed G. bergeri as the pathogen responsible for the mediastinal abscess in our case. In general, Gemella species are known to be catalase-negative, slow-growing, fastidious, facultatively anaerobic, salt-tolerant, nonsatelliting, Gram-positive cocci. In addition, Gemella species have variable Gram staining patterns and may exhibit a polymorphic shape. These properties can lead to its misidentification as viridans streptococci or other related microorganisms. Before 1988, there were only two known Gemella species: G. haemolysans and G. morbillorum. G. bergeri was first isolated by Collins et al. in 1998 (2). It is believed that Gemella species are harmless commensal microorganisms in the oral cavity and upper respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tract; however, there have been several reports of localized and generalized infections due to Gemella species. Of the nine species in the genus Gemella, seven (G. bergeri, G. morbillorum, G. haemolysans, G. sanguinis, G. asaccharolytica, G. parahaemolysans, G. taiwanensis) have been recognized as causative agents of infective endocarditis (2-9,17-19), brain abscess (20), septic arthritis (21), liver abscess (22), Lemierre's syndrome (10), and cutaneous orbital abscess (11) in humans. G. bergeri infection is especially rare and limited to a few case reports for this reason (2-11). In addition, because of limitations in conventional diagnostic testing and difficulty identifying G. bergeri, instances of this bacteria may have been misidentified as G. haemolysans, G. morbillorum, or viridans streptococci in the past (3,23), accounting for the rarity of G. bergeri. Clinically, the involvement of anaerobic bacteria or Enterobacteriaceae should be considered because of air collection inside the abscess on chest CT (Fig. 1). In our case, Enterobacteriaceae did not grow on 5% sheep blood agar medium aerobically or anaerobically. Anaerobic transport devices and chambers were not available in our hospital. Therefore we prescribed metronidazole in combination with sulbactam\/ampicillin based on the presumption of anaerobic bacteria. It is reported that the susceptibility rate of obligate anaerobes to sulbactam\/ampicillin is high (24,25). However, some obligate anaerobes (e.g., Bacteroides species) may show resistance to sulbactam\/ampicillin (25,26). We therefore prescribed metronidazole while being alert for encephalopathy in our case; consequently there was no evidence of antibiotic-associated encephalopathy (27). Of the past 15 case reports of G. bergeri infections (2-11), 6 patients were treated with penicillin (3,6,8-11) and 4 with ceftriaxone, depending on the susceptibility (4-6,9); however, the antibiotics were not mentioned in 7 reports. Ceftriaxone may be a viable option for treating G. bergeri infection if susceptible. Microorganisms responsible for mediastinal abscess are related to the primary source. Gemella species are commonly recognized as a part of the normal oral flora and are frequently found in patients with white-spot lesions and gingivitis (28). Bacteremia after toothbrushing and dental procedures is associated with poor oral hygiene and gingival bleeding. Thus, they are known causes of bacterial entry into the bloodstream (29,30). Our patient had a history of gingivitis and a finding of chronic periodontitis, but 2 sets of blood cultures were negative despite a long 14-day incubation. In addition, he underwent ipsilateral trans-thoraco-abdominal retrosternal gastric tube reconstruction after subtotal esophagectomy. We concluded that this was the most likely source of infection in this case, as G. bergeri is part of the normal flora of the upper gastrointestinal tract (1). Obesity and diabetes mellitus are associated with mediastinitis following cardiac surgery (31). Furthermore, the risk of mediastinitis after surgical esophageal anastomosis is correlated with cervical anastomosis, female gender, and a pre-operative smoking habit (32). Our patient did not have a history of obesity, diabetes mellitus, or a smoking habit but had undergone cervical anastomosis, which may have been associated with this mediastinal abscess contaminated with intraesophageal G. bergeri. However, no leakage was found immediately after surgery by esophagography, and the abscess completely disappeared on the 62nd day, as revealed by CT. A rare disease, mediastinal abscess caused by G. bergeri, was successfully treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy. The accurate diagnosis of rare or difficult-to-identify pathogens is challenging for clinical microbiological laboratories. In cases where pathogenic microorganisms cannot be identified by conventional methods, rare or difficult-to-identify pathogens can be identified using MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. There have been no reports of mediastinal abscess caused by G. bergeri in the literature. We herein report the first case of mediastinal abscess caused by G. bergeri in Japan."}]},{"title":"First Case of Tricuspid Valve Endocarditis Caused by Gemella bergeri","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Gemella bergeri is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"305-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-positive","answer_start":22,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Gemella bergeri normally exist?","id":"305-3-1-2","answers":[{"text":"oral cavity, digestive and urinary tract","answer_start":101,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can G. bergeri cause?","id":"305-3-1-3","answers":[{"text":"endocarditis","answer_start":260,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Gemella bergeri?","id":"305-3-1-4","answers":[{"text":"cocci species arranged in pairs","answer_start":36,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Gemella bergeri is a Gram-positive cocci species arranged in pairs and composes the normal flora of oral cavity, digestive and urinary tract.

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and manifestations of Bacteroides caccae.    Methods:  The pathogenic bacteria isolated from patient blood was identified as Bacteroides caccae. Identification of the Bacteroides caccae was done by 16s rDNA sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization-time of light spectrometry.

Results:  After treatment had been completed, no episodes of fever occurred during the follow-up to date.    Conclusions:  Bacteroides caccae is regarded as an intestinal, opportunistic pathogenic bacteria. It can invade the mucosa of the intestine and cause various abdominal suppurative infections.

With the development of medical technology and the aging of the population, the prevalence of anaerobic bacterial infections is increasing because of the increased use of invasive operations, overuse of antibiotics, bodily trauma, tissue ischemia, and necrosis combined with other aerobic bacterial infections; furthermore, the types of drug resistance relating to pathogenic bacteria are changing constantly., Approximately 50% to 60% of surgical infections observed in clinical practice are related to anaerobes, and blood flow infection caused by anaerobes is particularly severe and associated with high mortality., Bacteroidetes species are the most common gram-negative obligate anaerobes detected in clinical practice. They exist as normal bacteria in the oral cavity, intestinal tract, and female genital tract of humans and animals, and they are opportunistic pathogens. For example, B. fragilis can cause local tissue infection or abscesses and infections in the female reproductive system, thoracic cavity, and intracranial region. It is the most common anaerobe that causes bacteremia. B. caccae is a member of the B. fragilis group, and it is a major component of the normal flora in the body that colonize the gastrointestinal tract., It is also a conditional pathogen; therefore, when the intestinal mucosa of the host is damaged, it may invade the blood and cause bloodstream infection. Clinical sepsis caused by bloodstream infection is rare, although B. caccae isolates have been reported. A case of periodontal abscess leading to filamentous Streptococcus infection combined with B. caccae infection was reported by Mark, and an infection caused by B. caccae was recently reported in China., We have reported the case of a patient with renal hypertension who experienced a bloodstream infection caused by B. caccae. The patient was suspected to have digestive tract tumors and was tested for serum tumor markers. The results for all tumor markers were normal, excluding CYFRA211 (a fragment of cytokeratin 19) and SCCA, for which slightly high levels were obtained. Therefore, the possibility of digestive tract tumors was excluded. Studies have reported that some B. fragilis strains can produce enterotoxin and parenteral enterotoxin, which lead to multiple pathological changes in the intestinal mucosa. The patient had a history of renal hypertension and an even longer history of uremia, and was admitted to our hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding. Our examination revealed an elevated neutrophil gelatinase-related protein level and the presence of hepatitis B. Because of the patient\u2019s complex medical history, long disease course, and severe underlying diseases, normal intestinal flora entered his bloodstream through damaged the intestinal mucosa after intestinal mucosal injury, causing bloodstream infection. The widespread application of antibiotics and presence of immunodeficiencies increase the risk of anaerobic bacteremia caused by opportunistic pathogens invading the bloodstream, and anaerobic bacteremia is becoming a primary cause of death in patients with chronic diseases. Thus, the early prevention and control of primary diseases can reduce the occurrence and development of anaerobic-bacteria bloodstream infection. The identification of B. caccae can be challenging because the clinical symptoms of B. caccae infections are similar to those of other bloodstream infections., The use of two or more sets of blood cultures substantially improves the positive testing rate of blood cultures such that patients can receive timely treatment and have a lower risk of death from the condition. The blood samples of our patient exhibited no bacterial growth in the two aerobic blood culture bottles for 5 days; conversely, bacterial growth was detected in the two anaerobic bottles using the automatic bacterial identification instrument after only 28 hours. Therefore, conducting aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures concurrently in clinical practice improves the detection rate of pathogenic bacteria. Our results demonstrated that mass spectrometry is an excellent diagnostic tool for the identification of rare anaerobes such as B. caccae., The daily blood work revealed positive blood culture results, and bacteria was observed in the gram-staining smear; however, no bacterial growth was observed in the cultures. In such a case, the presence of anaerobic bacteria should be considered. Our experience also alerted us to the essential role of anaerobic cultures in clinical practice. B. fragilis is widely distributed in clinical specimens, and it requires appropriate antibiotic management for patients with anaerobic infection. Notably, anaerobic bacteria are resistant to various commonly used antibiotics. Among anaerobes, the most common mechanism of antimicrobial resistance to \u03b2-lactams is the production of \u03b2-lactamase enzymes. The resistance of B. caccae to 5-nitroimidazole is related to its nim gene.,, Carbapenems are widely used in the treatment of clinical infectious diseases and carbapenem-resistant strains of B. fragilis have been identified, which is related to the cfiA gene encoding a metallo-lactamase. In addition to symptomatic treatment, our patient was administered empirical medication after admission. He initially received a combination therapy of omeprazole sodium and cefodizime, which failed to control the infection. Subsequently, linezolid was added to the medication regimen. However, the severity of the patient\u2019s condition and rapid progression of the disease caused him to reject further rescue therapy. The patient was discharged, and we were unable to ascertain the therapeutic effects of the administered antibiotics. Therefore, hospitals should perform drug sensitivity tests for anaerobic bacteria to increase the precision of treatments. Given the increasing prevalence of hypertension and presence of primary diseases of poverty in China, anaerobic bacterial infection should be considered in differential diagnosis for patients with hypertension who present with gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The early prevention and control of primary diseases can reduce the occurrence and development of anaerobic bloodstream infection. Furthermore, two or more sets of blood culture greatly improves the positive test rate of blood cultures of anaerobic bacteria, and identification through mass spectrometry can play a role in B. caccae diagnosis. With the increasing drug resistance of anaerobic bacteria, drug sensitivity testing for anaerobic bacteria must be conducted in more hospitals."}]}]},{"species":"Bacteroides fluxus","docs":[{"title":"First case of abdominal infection caused by bacteroides fluxus","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Bacteroides fluxus is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"307-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":25,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Bacteroides fluxus normally exist?","id":"307-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"human faeces in healthy individuals","answer_start":72,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Bacteroides fluxus cause?","id":"307-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"abdominal infection","answer_start":204,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are B. fluxus resistant to?","id":"307-1-1-4","answers":[{"text":"penicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, clindamycin and moxifloxacin","answer_start":602,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Bacteroides fluxus's requirement for oxygen?","id":"307-1-1-5","answers":[{"text":"anaerobic","answer_start":39,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Bacteroides fluxus?","id":"307-1-1-6","answers":[{"text":"bacillus","answer_start":49,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Bacteroides fluxus is a Gram-negative anaerobic bacillus isolated from human faeces in healthy individuals.

Clinicopathological characteristics, patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility, predisposing factors, and outcomes of B. gladioli bloodstream infection were retrospectively analyzed in newborns treated between 2008 and 2011. During the 3-year study period, B. gladioli was isolated from the blood cultures of 14 patients (3.7 per 1,000 admissions). In all, 5 (35.7 %) of the 14 cases had a positive blood culture at the time of initial admission. Primary diagnoses in the neonates were severe major congenital anomalies, congenital leukemia, prematurity with respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, and parapneumonic pleural effusion. In total, 10 (71.4 %) of the patients underwent \u22652 invasive procedures. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 21.4 %, whereas the mortality rate due to B. gladioli infection was 7 %.    Conclusion:  B. gladioli might be a causative microorganism of both early neonatal and nosocomial sepsis in newborns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on B. gladioli infection in newborns. Invasive procedures and severe major congenital anomalies may be predisposing factors for B. gladioli bloodstream infection in neonates.

This strain also contained galactose and arabinose as characteristic whole-cell sugars, in addition to meso-diaminopimelic acid as the dominant cell wall diamino acid. The strain also contained mycolic acid, which is characteristic of the genera Nocardia and Rhodococcus. The major menaquinone was MK-8(H4\u03c9-cycle). The analyses of the fatty acids by gas-liquid chromatography revealed the expected pattern diagnostic for members of the genus Nocardia and related taxa, i.e., straight-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids together with a diagnostic amount of tuberculostearic acid (10-methyl branched octadecanoic acid). Strain IFM 10035 could be separated from the closely related species N. farcinica and N. beijingensis and from N. nova and N. asteroides by a combination of qualitative and quantitative differences in its fatty acid pattern (Table \u200b(Table1).1). Strain IFM 10035 was also examined for a set of phenotypic characteristics (Table \u200b(Table2),2), and it was clear from this information that the present strain could be distinguished from other validly described Nocardia species by a combination of phenotypic characteristics, such as decomposition of xanthine, utilization of carbohydrates, and maximum growth temperature. Comparison of the nearly complete 16S rDNA sequence from strain IFM 10035 and the corresponding sequences of other Nocardia species (1, 7, 8) showed that the strain forms a monophyletic clade with N. beijingensis in the neighbor-joining tree (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1).1). The sequence similarity value between strain IFM 10035 and N. beijingensis IFM 10174 was 98.9%, and a high bootstrap value (98%) was obtained by neighbor-joining analysis. However, strain IFM 10035 and N. beijingensis IFM 10174 share a DNA-DNA relatedness value of only 14 to 17%. This value was well below the 70% cutoff point for a species classification, as recommended by Wayne et al. (36). The unique 16S rDNA, low level of DNA-DNA hybridization, and phenotypic results supported the conclusion that strain IFM 10035 is a new species of the genus Nocardia. We therefore propose the name N. arthritidis sp. nov. Phylogenetic tree derived from 16S rDNA sequences. The tree was created by the neighbor-joining method with KNUC values (12). The numbers on the tree indicate bootstrap values for the branch points. Only values above 50% significance are indicated. Fatty acid compositions of N. arthritidis IFM 10035, N. beijingensis IFM 10174, N. farcinica DSM 43665, N. nova DSM 44481, and N. asteroides DSM 43757 Phenotypic properties that distinguish isolate strains from type strains of Nocardia species  Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was chosen as treatment for this patient after a tentative diagnosis of pulmonary nocardiosis as a result of finding a filamentous gram-positive bacillus in his sputum. However, the patient had adverse reactions, such as general fatigue, loss of appetite, and renal dysfunction. Therefore, imipenem therapy was started, and the effect was only marginal because the C-reactive protein value decreased from 7.6 to 2.4 mg\/dl 10 days after administration but returned to 7.6 mg\/dl in the next 16 days even with continuous treatment with imipenem. Since our susceptibility study indicated that both the N. arthritidis and the N. farcinica strains isolated from the same patient were susceptible to minocycline (MICs, 1 \u03bcg ml), minocycline therapy was started. The patient responded well to minocycline, and the nocardiosis resolved 6 months after the administration of minocycline. No recurrence of the infection has been noted for about 2 years. The drug susceptibility patterns of N. farcinica IFM 10034 and N. arthritidis IFM 10035 were also compared (Table \u200b(Table3).3). N. farcinica IFM 10034 was highly susceptible to ampicillin and gentamicin, but it was only slightly susceptible to erythromycin. N. arthritidis IFM 10035 was resistant to ampicillin, gentamicin, clindamycin, and erythromycin. Differences in drug susceptibilities were observed between the two strains; and these data indicate the importance of careful drug selection for the treatment of the concurrent nocardial infections, because each Nocardia species shows species-specific drug susceptibility patterns. Drug susceptibilities of two clinical isolates of N. arthritidis IFM 10035 and N. farcinica IFM 10034  N. beijingensis, a recently established species, was isolated from soil in China (35). A recent report (10) described the first case of human infection due to N. beijingensis, and it was proposed that members of the species N. beijingensis be categorized as an opportunistic infection group, regardless of their original isolation from soil. Phylogenetically, N. arthritidis is most closely related to the recently characterized species N. beijingensis. Most clinical manifestations due to N. beijingnsis isolates were found in the lungs of patients from Japan and Thailand (10), suggesting the high degree of association of N. beijingensis with pulmonary or systemic disease. N. arthritidis IFM 10035 was also an isolate from a patient with pulmonary nocardiosis, indicating that both Nocardia species can be classified into the members of a pathogenicity group that invade the lungs in a manner similar to that for N. farcinica and Nocardia pseudobrasiliensis. Although N. arthritidis IFM 10035 and N. beijingensis are phenotypically and pathologically closely related, both bacteria are differentiated by characteristics such as the decomposition of xanthine, nonutilization of rhamnose and sorbitol, and growth at 45\u00b0C. Nocardia species can usually be distinguished in most clinical laboratories by use of a combination of biochemical, chemical, and morphological features. However, most laboratories have difficulty with identification of the species of the N. asteroides group using these methods, necessitating the introduction of genotypic methods into several clinical laboratories. Such genotypic tests may show that concurrent infections (30) are more common than generally believed in immunocompromised patients.  Nocardia arthritidis (ar.thri\u2032ti.dis.

Up to one-third of patients with nocardiosis, however, are immnunocompetent. Nocardia are ubiquitous in the environment and can be found worldwide as saprophytic entities in fresh and salt water, soil, dust, and decaying vegetation. Cutaneous manifestation of nocardiosis can be classified into primary cutaneous nocardiosis and disseminated disease. Primary cutaneous nocardiosis results from direct inoculation of pathogenic Nocardia. Disseminated disease is more common and usually occurs in the setting of primary pulmonary infection and underlying immunosuppression. Primary cutaneous nocardiosis can be further divided into three major subtypes: lymphocutaneous disease, superficial cellulitis, and nocardial mycetoma. Cutaneous nocardiosis can result from traumatic injury to the skin that involves contamination with soil and resembles soft tissue infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus or streptococci; however, this form of nocardial disease usually follows an indolent course. We supposed that the organism might have gained access via a contaminated superficial abrasion on the patient's forearm, thus formimg superficial cellulitis in our case. Three cases of primary cutaneous nocardiosis caused by N. takedensis have been identified. The first case involved a 68-year-old woman in Taiwan who had chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus and presented with foot cellulitis. N. takedensis was isolated from a biopsy of foot tissue. The second case was a healthy 33-year-old man in Mexico who presented with hemithoracic actinomycetoma. The last case was a 68-year-old woman with a history of follicular lymphoma and myelodysplastic syndrome after allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation who presented with painful lymphangitic erythematous papules on the left arm after suffering an abrasion on the left dorsal hand. All patients were treated with oral TMP-SMX. The genus Nocardia consists of distinctive gram-positive variably acid-fast, strictly aerobic bacteria that form branched aerial and substrate filaments which, as they age, fragment into pleomorphic rod-shaped or coccoid elements. The colonies with abundant aerial filamentous growths have a chalky white or cotton-ball appearance on blood agar plates and may resemble Streptomyces species or, superficially, even some fungi. The organisms are rarely partially acid\u2013fast with routine Ziehl-Neelsen stain. Actinomyces may appear morphologically similar to these organisms, but unlike Nocardia, they are not acid\u2013fast and grow under anaerobic conditions. Most other fungal hyphal structures do not figure in the differential diagnosis of Nocardia as they have much thicker hyphal forms. Clinicians and pathologists should be aware that the Nocardia genus continues to undergo the addition of new species; more than 50 species have been identified to date. The species variability in general morphologic characteristics and acid fastness, which is caused by differences in cell wall mycolic acid composition and the type of stain used, makes identification and species differentiation challenging. Classical identification based on colony morphology or morphological characteristics of Nocardia does not allow for differentiation between the numerous species. The new molecular methods based on the 16S rRNA gene are crucial for Nocardia identification. The different species of Nocardia display variable in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, so management of nocardial infections must be individualized. TMP-SMX is active against most species; however, clinicians should note that N. otitidiscaviarum, N. nova, and N. farcinica have shown notable resistance and that up to 42% of Nocardia isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for antimicrobial susceptibility testing between 1995 and 2004 were resistant to TMP-SMX. Alternative antimicrobial agents with activity against Nocardia include amikacin, imipenem, meropenem, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, minocycline, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, linezolid, tigecyclin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Combination therapy with imipenem and cefotaxime, amikacin and TMP-SMX, imipenem and TMP-SMX, amikacin and cefotaxime, or amikacin and imipenem may provide enhanced efficacy. The suggested duration of therapy ranges from 6 weeks for minor infections to 1 year for severe systemic diseases. In our case, the minimum inhibitory concentration ceftriaxone, amikacin and TMP-SMX were checked. The bacterial strain was susceptible to ceftriaxone and TMP-SMX. In conclusion, the new molecular identification methods based on the 16S rRNA gene for Nocardia identification are crucial. Because there are no optimal recommendations for treatment of all Nocardia species, physicians should use empirical combination therapy that may include TMP-SMX, ceftriaxone, and imipenem until susceptibility results are available. The authors recommend that identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing be performed by a reference laboratory to help guide therapeutic decisions for all clinical Nocardia isolates."}]},{"title":"Nocardia takedensis: a newly recognized pathogen responsible for skin and soft tissue infections","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Nocardia takedensis cause?","id":"311-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"lymphangitis","answer_start":96,"id":1},{"text":"cutaneous infection","answer_start":834,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of N. takedensis?","id":"311-3-1-2","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":552,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are N. takedensis sensitive to?","id":"311-3-1-3","answers":[{"text":"trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid","answer_start":358,"id":1},{"text":"trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole","answer_start":358,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Nocardia takedensis normally exist?","id":"311-3-1-4","answers":[{"text":"soil in Japan","answer_start":53,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Nocardia takedensis was first isolated in 2005, from soil in Japan.

To date, there have been three reported cases (two ocular and one pulmonary) of N. amamiensis infection [2], [3]. Here we report a pulmonary infection in an immunocompromised patient. In 2014, a 43-year-old woman from Oaxaca, Mexico, sought care at the emergency department with recent onset shortness of breath; she had experienced fever, weight loss, and productive cough over the last 3 months. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report. Her medical history included primary glomerulonephritis treated with 32.5 mg per day of prednisone and tacrolimus for the previous 5 months. During the initial evaluation, she had diminished breath sounds over the right lung base and tachycardia. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest revealed multiple cavitary lesions in the right lower lung lobe. Laboratory studies revealed hemoglobin of 8.2 g\/dL and 13 800\/\u03bcL white blood cells. Empiric treatment with intravenous clindamycin and ceftriaxone was initiated. We performed a bronchoalveolar lavage, and the sample was inoculated in soy agar with 5% sheep blood plates and incubated under aerobic conditions at 35\u00b0C. After 6 days\u2019 incubation, we observed the growth of chalky irregular grey colonies in the culture media which were positive for the modified Kinyoun acid-fast staining. We performed conventional biochemical tests (Table 1) along with amplification and nucleotide sequencing of the partial 16S rRNA, as well as secA1 genes. The sequences were compared with those available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/). The interpretation was performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute\u2019s (CLSI) statement [4]. The nucleotide sequences showed 100 and 99.6% matches with N. amamiensis respectively. We also performed susceptibility testing for amoxicillin\/clavulanate, moxifloxacin, imipenem and amikacin according to the CLSI\u2019s statement [5] (Table 1). Microbiologic investigations and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; TMP\/SMX, trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole. On day 9 of admission, the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome that required mechanical ventilatory support. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where she spent 1 month with a fluctuating clinical course. Upon Nocardia spp. identification, ceftriaxone and clindamycin were discontinued, and she initiated therapy with imipenem\/cilastatin and trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole. Brain magnetic resonance imaging scan was negative for central nervous system dissemination, and prednisone was tapered down over the course of hospitalization. After weaning from mechanical ventilation, she was discharged from the ICU and completed 36 days of imipenem\/cilastatin and trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole. The patient was discharged from the hospital and sent home with trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis. No relapse episodes were documented after 20 months of follow-up. Nocardia spp. are branching, Gram-positive rods that occasionally cause infection in humans. Over two-thirds of the patients have depressed cell-mediated immunity [6], [7]. Nocardia spp. are found in the environment, and inhalation is the primary route of contagion. Pulmonary nocardiosis is thus the most frequent clinical presentation [8]. The central nervous system is the preferred extrapulmonary site of dissemination, and imaging should be performed of immunocompromised patients [5]. The genus Nocardia comprises more than 86 species and will continue to expand as DNA sequencing progresses. Each species may display different antibiotic susceptibility patterns and levels of pathogenicity [9]. Species-level identification is not always possible by biochemical tests, and gene sequencing may help clarify the proper treatment. N. amamiensis is a newly recognized cause of pulmonary infection. The clinical features resemble those of the rest of the Nocardia genus. However, to understand the epidemiology and susceptibility patterns of the different species of Nocardia, it is important for laboratories to identify them by promptly using DNA target sequencing."}]}]},{"species":"Nocardia beijingensis","docs":[{"title":"Spectrum and clinicomicrobiological profile of Nocardia keratitis caused by rare species of Nocardia identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Nocardia beijingensis is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"314-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Nocardiakeratitis","answer_start":564,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Nocardia beijingensis cause?","id":"314-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"Nocardiakeratitis","answer_start":564,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Nocardia beijingensis sensitive to?","id":"314-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"amikacin and tobramycin","answer_start":904,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"  Purpose:  To report the predisposing factors, clinical profile, and treatment outcome of patients with keratitis that was caused by a rare species of Nocardia.

Nocardia spp. are ubiquitous environmental saprophytes in soil, organic matter, and aquatic habitats, including waste-water systems. Human infection usually arises from direct inoculation of the skin or soft tissues or by inhalation. It is an opportunistic pathogen most commonly affecting immunocompromised patients, although approximately one-third are immunocompetent [1]. The patients at highest risk are those with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, solid organ transplantation, HIV infection, malignancy, and chronic glucocorticoid therapy [1]. Overall, the incidence of nocardiosis among patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome is relatively low (0.1-0.4%) compared with other opportunistic diseases. The patients with a low CD4 T-cell count (less than 100 cells\/mm) are considered at the highest risk, with increased morbidity and mortality rates. Conventional TMP\/SMX prophylaxis may reduce the rate of nocardial infection in transplant recipients and HIV-infected patients; however, cases have been reported in patients receiving such treatment or associated with poor adherence, as was reported by our patient [2]. Central nervous system (CNS) nocardiosis has a low prevalence but high morbidity and mortality [1,6]. Anagnostou et al. presented a review of 84 cases of CNS nocardiosis reported in the literature from January 2000 to December 2011; the most typical signs and symptoms of CNS nocardiosis were variable and included focal neurologic abnormalities (51%), headache (45%), fever (40%), altered mental status (36%), seizures (28%), visual changes (21%), nausea and vomiting (21%) [6]. Clinical manifestations usually result from local effects of granulomas or abscesses in the brain, mainly in the supratentorial region and, less commonly, the spinal cord or meninges [7]. Depending on the abscess phase, the lesion can be seen in a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging as a single or double ring enhancement [8]. Approximately 54% of cases reported of Nocardia brain abscess were solitary lesions, while 38% of cases had multiple lesions [9]. The MRI of our patient showed broad encephalic lesions with ring enhancement in the right frontal, occipital lobes, and mesencephalon. Clinically relevant isolates of Nocardia should be identified beyond the genus level because each species has its clinical spectrum of disease, sensitivity, and resistance profile to different antibiotics [10]. Mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization-time of flight {MALDI-TOF} MS) is considered a reliable methodology that allows the identification of Nocardia isolates, reporting in 95.9% identification at the species level. The definitive identification method, mainly for uncommon species, is based on sequencing genes such as 16S rRNA, secA1, hsp65, gyrA, and rpoB [11]. Nocardia beijingensis was first described in China in 2001, phenotypically characterized and 16S rRNA gene sequence reported and classified within the Nocardia abscessus complex [11,12]. There have been reports of Nocardia beijingensis infection in HIV-positive patients from the United States [13] and Thailand [7] including in immunocompetent patients from Japan and Colombia [8,9]. There are reports of central nervous system infections caused by Nocardia beijingensis, mainly in male patients between 45 and 71 years of age with various comorbidities such as HIV infection, kidney transplant, diabetes mellitus, and even immunocompetent patients [7-10,13-15]. In those reports, the CNS was the primary source in four cases [8,9,13,14]. In our patient, other foci of Nocardia infection were ruled out, as was the absence of respiratory symptoms and a normal chest x-ray as well as absence of cutaneous lesions, so that his presentation was limited to the CNS. The selection of antibiotics for empirical combination therapy should be based on Nocardia species. An option as a primary scheme would be TMP\/SMX plus imipenem, considering adding amikacin in cases with multi-organ involvement. As alternative schemes, the use of meropenem plus linezolid has been mentioned. Imipenem showed better activity with less minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in vitro [16]. Our susceptibility test reported resistance to imipenem that was consistent with the study reported in Taiwan of 151 unduplicated Nocardia isolates; of which, nine were Nocardia beijigensis isolates, five were susceptible, and four had intermediate sensitivity to imipenem with an MIC between 0.5 and 8 ug\/mL [17]. Another case report of an HIV-infected Hispanic patient with CNS infection by Nocardia beijigensis showed resistance to imipenem [13]. The Nocardia beijigensis isolates reported so far are susceptible to TMP\/SMX [10,13,17]. However, treatment failure has been observed when used alone, especially in disseminated and central nervous system nocardiosis. Empirical combination with TMP\/SMX, linezolid, or aminoglycosides is a reasonable decision since linezolid has excellent activity against all Nocardia species reported to date and has a CNS penetration of 60-70% [8,13,16,17]. The optimal duration of treatment for Nocardia infections is unclear and depends on the patient's clinical status and immune system."}]},{"title":"Disseminated Nocardia beijingensis Infection in an Immunocompetent Patient","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Nocardia beijingensis cause?","id":"314-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"disseminated infection","answer_start":368,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Nocardia beijingensis's requirement for oxygen?","id":"314-3-1-2","answers":[{"text":"aerobic","answer_start":23,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Nocardia beijingensis?","id":"314-3-1-3","answers":[{"text":"filamentous branching bacteria with fragmentation into bacillary or coccoid forms","answer_start":65,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Nocardia is a genus of aerobic, non-motile and non-spore-forming filamentous branching bacteria with fragmentation into bacillary or coccoid forms.

In 2001 Wang et al. isolated this strain of Nocardia from sewage and studied the 16S DNA\/RNA sequence to find the chemotaxonomic, physiological and morphological similarities to genus Nocardia. The first cases of human infections were from Japan and Thailand. Since then, human infections have been reported all over the world due to this pathogen. Similar to genus Nocardia in general, infections due to this pathogen are mostly seen in immunocompromised patients and immunocompetent hosts being infected is rare. This is the first reported case of Nocardia beijingensis infection in the USA outside the state of Florida, and the seventh case of reported infection due to Nocardia beijingensis in an immunocompetent patient in the world. The lungs are usually the primary site of infection with the central nervous system (CNS) being the most common site of dissemination. It can also cause skin and soft tissue infection, muscle abscess and ocular infection, mainly reported in immunocompromised patients. There have been very few cases of Nocardia beijingensis infection in immunocompetent patients reported in the medical literature. Table 1 gives a brief review of patient characteristics, presentation and duration of symptoms before a successful diagnosis was achieved in these reported cases to date. Most patients with pulmonary nocardiosis have underlying lung conditions such as COPD and asthma. Diagnosis is often delayed due to the need for tissue sampling. Nocardia is a slow-growing organism which may take up to 3 weeks to grow. Accurate identification using restriction enzyme analysis and 16S rRNA gene sequencing is required to identify the strain. Reported cases of Nocardia beijingensis in immunocompetent patients No randomized trial to determine the most effective therapy against Nocardia beijingensis has been conducted. Based on the reported cases, TMP\/SMX therapy has been shown to be successful. Amikacin, imipenem and third-generation cephalosporins have been used with success as well, although recently imipenem resistance was reported by Gonzalez et al..

Accurate and rapid identification of Nocardia spp. is critical to optimize empiric antimicrobial therapy. Routine identification of Nocardia to the species level is a time-consuming process. Furthermore, these phenotypic tests may be inconclusive and difficult to interpret, resulting in limitations in the identification of Nocardia species [1, 2]. Additionally, the genus Nocardia has undergone substantial taxonomic revisions with the advent of molecular methods, rendering interpretation of identification challenging compared to historic data [2]. Methods that do not rely upon differential growth characteristics including antibiotic profiles such as 16S rDNA sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) can provide more rapid and accurate identifications of challenging organisms such as Nocardia spp [3].  N. thailandica was first identified in 2004 from a soft tissue infection. In that report, the authors did not provide information on antimicrobial therapy [4]. The next report of N. thailandica was by Reddy et al., who isolated twenty Nocardia spp. from ocular infections; N. thailandica represented just one of the twenty isolated species [5]. While this report gave more thorough information on the susceptibilities of the isolate, the patient's treatment regimen was not delineated. Canterino et al. reported a 66-year-old patient on immunosuppressive therapy status post-lung transplant who had pulmonary nocardiosis [6]. Upon identification of N. thailandica via percutaneous lung biopsy, the patient was treated with meropenem for one month, followed by oral minocycline to complete six to twelve months of therapy. Following six weeks of antibiotic therapy, follow-up imaging revealed a good overall response to therapy. Bourbour et al. reported a 53-year-old, immunocompetent man with chronic bronchitis, who presented with persistent fever and cough and was found to have nodular infiltrates on chest X-ray [7]. A bronchoalveolar lavage sample grew Nocardia thailandica and the patient was treated with TMP\/SMX and linezolid for 6 months. The authors reported that the patient's symptoms resolved completely. Optimal therapy for Nocardia spp. has not been well established [1, 8]. Considerations for selecting therapy should be based on species of Nocardia identified, site, and severity of infection. Combination therapy against Nocardia spp. has been thought to provide enhanced activity and is recommended for initial treatment for most forms of nocardiosis. Single-drug therapy may be sufficient after species identification, and antimicrobial drug susceptibility information can be confirmed [8]. As no randomized controlled trials provide guidance on optimal treatment, this recommendation is largely based on clinical experience. Patients with CNS nocardiosis may have increased mortality; therefore, combination therapy is often strongly recommended [9]. Ceftriaxone, meropenem\/imipenem, sulfonamides, linezolid, and amikacin are often options for the treatment of nocardiosis. However, based on drug susceptibility testing at the species level, there is a wide range of variation in coverage [10, 11].  Table 1 reveals antibiotic susceptibility data of Nocardia thailandica from the literature and our case. Susceptibility profile of Nocardia thailandica based on the existing published literature. AMK: amikacin; AMC: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid; AZI: azithromycin; FEP: cefepime; CRO: ceftriaxone; CIP: ciprofloxacin; CLR: clarithromycin; DOX: doxycycline; GAT: gatifloxacin; IPM, imipenem; LZD: linezolid; MIN: minocycline; MXF: moxifloxacin; TOB: tobramycin; SXT: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. S: susceptible; I: intermediate; R: resistant; 1\/2 strains were susceptible and the other resistant. Of the four strains of N. thailandica with full susceptibility data reported, all were susceptible to ceftriaxone and carbapenems. Of the most common susceptible agents, ceftriaxone and TMP\/SMX have the most optimal blood-brain barrier penetration and may be ideal for the treatment of CNS nocardiosis [12]. Due to poor penetration into the CNS and an unfavorable toxicity profile with prolonged administration, amikacin would be a suboptimal option. Linezolid, despite good CNS penetration, has significant adverse effects associated with prolonged use, such as thrombocytopenia, peripheral neuropathy, and optic neuropathy, the latter two of which are irreversible. Imipenem also penetrates the CNS well; however, it has well-known toxicity of seizures limiting its use. Moxifloxacin reaches high CSF concentrations and is active against selected Nocardia spp.; however, it has extremely limited human data [10, 12]. Meropenem, while certainly an option for CNS nocardiosis, may prove to be overly broad and increase the risk of selecting resistant organisms. Additionally, the increased dosing frequency of meropenem would also prove to be a limitation of outpatient treatment as compared to the dosing regimen selected for our patient, once-daily dosing of ceftriaxone. In summary, ceftriaxone and TMP\/SMX would be potentially ideal agents for the treatment of CNS nocardiosis given their coverage for Nocardia thailandia and good penetration into the CNS."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Nocardia thailandica cause?","id":"315-1-4-1","answers":[{"text":"brain abscess","answer_start":39,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"This is the first documented case of a brain abscess due to N. thailandica which was successfully treated.

The patient presented complaining of upper respiratory symptoms including sinus pressure, headaches, and decreased hearing in the left ear for a month prior to admission. There was no history of fevers, chills, exposure to sick contacts, or recent travel. Nine months earlier, he was admitted and underwent heart transplant surgery, for which he received and was maintained on immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone, as well as prophylactic treatment with valganciclovir and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Four months after his cardiac transplant, the patient developed chronic cough. Chest X rays and computed tomography (CT) scanning performed at that time revealed bilateral patchy, ill-defined, dense nodular parenchymal opacities (Fig. 1A and \u200bandB).B). Sputum Gram stains revealed few hyphae, and cultures performed from a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid sample grew 1 CFU of Aspergillus fumigatus. A right upper lobe transbronchial biopsy specimen revealed mild chronic mucosal wall inflammation with no evidence of malignancy or granuloma, and the acid-fast bacillus (AFB) and Grocott-Gomori's methenamine silver (GMS) stains were negative. Routine bacterial, AFB, and mycology cultures from lavage samples were without growth, as were AFB cultures of the biopsy specimen. The patient was started on voriconazole and had subjective improvement after 2 weeks. (A, B) Bilateral patchy, ill-defined, dense nodular, parenchymal opacities in the lungs at 4 months after heart transplant. (C, D) Pulmonary embolism with large clot burden within the right pulmonary artery, multiple areas of consolidation with cavitation, evolving from larger denser areas and new left lower lobe consolidation at 8 months posttransplant. (E, F) Follow-up 6 weeks into therapy revealing nodular consolidative changes, some improved and others new and enlarged. Four months later, and while still on voriconazole, he presented with acute shortness of breath. A chest CT scan showed pulmonary embolism with a large clot burden within the right pulmonary artery and multiple areas of consolidation with cavitation, evolving from larger, denser areas of consolidation seen in the prior study (Fig. 1C and \u200bandD).D). In addition, a new left lower lobe consolidation was revealed. He was started on enoxaparin, and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed. A sputum Gram stain revealed Gram-negative bacilli later identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additionally, rhinovirus was detected in a BAL fluid specimen by multiplex PCR (Biofire FilmArray). A repeat right upper lobe transbronchial biopsy specimen confirmed the presence of focal chronic lymphocytic inflammation, again with no evidence of fungal elements or granulomas. AFB and mycology analyses of BAL fluid specimens were culture negative, and routine bacterial culture grew only <1+ normal flora. Voriconazole levels were performed, and the results were within the therapeutic range (voriconazole levels of 1.8 \u03bcg\/ml). However, because of concern over voriconazole failure and\/or superimposed bacterial infection, the patient was placed on ceftazidime (1 g every 8 h [q8h]), voriconazole (200 mg q8h), and caspofungin (50 mg q24h). On a return visit a month later, radiographic studies showed progression of airspace disease despite improvement in his pulmonary symptoms. At this time, caspofungin was stopped and the patient continued on voriconazole. However, the patient returned again 2 weeks after with symptoms of viral rhinosinusitis and worsening pulmonary infiltrates on imaging, which prompted his admission. He did not report fever, shortness of breath, or cough. His prior medical history was significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypersensitivity lung disease (HLD), cerebral vascular accident, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to duodenal angioectasia. He was a former smoker and denied any allergies, exposure to pets or animals, or recent travel history. His physical examination was unremarkable except for swollen and hyperemic nasal turbinates and poor dentition. A complete blood count was notable for total leukocytes of 9,000\/mm, 82% neutrophils, 3.0% lymphocytes, decreased hemoglobin of 11 g\/dl, and hematocrit of 33% but a normal platelet count of 463,000\/mm. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and glucose were within reference ranges. Shortly after admission, the patient underwent a percutaneous left lung biopsy and a biopsy specimen was obtained. An initial Gram stain revealed the presence of 1+ thin, branching, beaded Gram-positive rods (Fig. 2B). The routine microbiological cultures (blood agar, chocolate agar, and Sabouraud-dextrose agar at 35\u00b0C and 6% CO2) grew distinct, white\/beige, hard, rough-surfaced colonies, pitting into the agar (Fig. 2A), highly suggestive of Nocardia species. Growth was observed on Lowenstein-Jensen medium after 3 days (at 35\u00b0C), revealing colonies with the same characteristics. Modified acid-fast stain confirmed the presence of partially acid-fast branching rods. (A) Individual colonies were dome shaped, with a white\/beige, hard, rough (coral-like) surface (blood agar, 35\u00b0C). (B) Characteristic thin, branching, beaded Gram-positive rods (Gram stain, \u00d7100 magnification). Direct colony method identification through matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was attempted but failed to render a reliable identification. Subsequently, the isolate was grown on blood agar and subjected to an extraction protocol that followed the inactivated-Mycobacteria\/-Nocardia bead preparation method as suggested by the manufacturer (Bruker Daltonics, Inc., Billerica, MA). In brief, a 1-\u03bcl loopful of Nocardia colony biomass was collected in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing 300 \u03bcl of deionized water and 900 \u03bcl of absolute ethanol, which was then vortexed and incubated for 10 min at 100\u00b0C. The sample was then centrifuged at maximum speed for 2 min, followed by the addition of 500 \u03bcl of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade water, vortexing, and recentrifugation. Next, the supernatant was removed using a pipette, followed by the addition of 50 \u03bcl of deionized water, vortexing, and resuspension of the pellet. After a 60-min heat inactivation at 100\u00b0C, the tube was allowed to cool down, and 1,200 \u03bcl of precooled absolute ethanol was added. The specimen was centrifuged at maximum speed for 4 min, and ethanol was carefully removed by pipetting and allowing the pellet to air dry for 5 min. Later, 200 \u03bcl of 1-mm silica beads was added, with consequent resuspension of the pellet through vortexing with a combination of 30 \u03bcl of pure acetonitrile and 30 \u03bcl of 70% formic acid. After mixing by vortexing for 5 s and centrifuging at maximum speed for 2 min, 1 \u03bcl of the supernatant was placed on the MALDI target, allowed to dry, and then overlaid with 1 \u03bcl of matrix solution for subsequent analysis by MALDI-TOF MS using the MicroFlex LT mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Inc., Billerica, MA). Based on the spectral fingerprint of the isolate, this confirmed the identification (identification score of 1.651) as Nocardia asteroides, followed by this same species as the second (score of 1.507) and third (score of 1.303) best matches, using the mycobacterial Mycolib 1.03 and bacterial MALDI Biotyper database version 3.3.1.2 libraries (Bruker). However, this score was insufficient to identify the isolate to the species level (a score of 2.0 or better is recommended) or even definitively to the genus level (score of 1.7 or better). Because the score was below the cutoff recommended by the manufacturer for confident identification to the genus level and the next-closest (but poor) matches were also to Nocardia species (Nocardia testacea, score of 1.179, and Nocardia thailandica, score of 1.102), we concluded that this isolate was most likely a Nocardia species either not or poorly represented in the database, and so we decided to further characterize this isolate at the molecular taxonomic level. Sequencing for identification was performed using the Fast MicroSeq 500 16S rRNA bacterial identification kit and 3130xl genetic analyzer (Life Technologies). It was identified as N. thailandica (100% sequence identity) using the BLAST search tool based on the GenBank database, followed by this same species as second and third best matches with 100% sequence identity. Molecular taxonomic confirmation of the isolate was performed by SecA1 amino acid analysis based on secA1 gene sequencing. DNA was extracted from the clinical isolate using PrepMan ultra sample preparation reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Following the procedure of Conville et al. (2), a region of the secA1 gene corresponding to bases 444 to 913 of the secA1 gene sequence of Nocardia farcinica IFM 10152 (3) was amplified, using the following primers with tails containing M13 binding sites: 5\u2032 GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA GGA CAG YGA GTC GAT GGG YCG SGT GCA CCG 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG ACG CGG ACG ATG TAG TCC TTG TC 3\u2032. PCR was performed using 1 pmol of each primer, approximately 0.2 \u03bcg of extracted DNA, and the FailSafe enzyme kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI). The amplicon underwent cycle sequencing using primers M13-forward (5\u2032 GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA G 3\u2032) and M13 reverse (5\u2032 CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG AC 3\u2032) (ABI BigDye terminator version 3.1 cycle sequencing kit; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) with the protocol according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing analysis was performed on the ABI3500 genetic analyzer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Sequence analysis and alignment of a 468-bp region of the secA1 gene was performed. Amino acid sequences were deduced from the secA1 gene sequences using the six-frame translation tool of San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) Biology Workbench (La Jolla, CA). An in-house validation was performed on approximately 20 isolates of each of the available Nocardia species in the UT Health Science Center Mycobacteria\/Nocardia laboratory. The secA1 gene sequences of all the isolates in the validation were analyzed and compared to the Nocardia type strains using the cutoff values suggested by Conville et al. (2), and a database was created in-house for secA1 gene analysis. The amino acid sequences obtained were compared to the sequences in the in-house-validated secA1 database. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence, comprised of 156 amino acid residues, showed 99.36% similarity (1 amino acid change) to the type strain of N. thailandica. There are no current CLSI guidelines for interpretation of secA1 sequences. Thus, the percent similarity and amino acid mismatch corresponding to \u226599% identity to the type strain were used, as in the method of Conville et al. (2).  Sequencing of the 1,500 bp of the 16S rRNA gene was then performed as previously described by Edwards et al. (1), using the ABI 3500 genetic analyzer. The following primers were used: pA-F, AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG; pC-F, CTA CGG GAG GCA GCA GTG GG; pD-R, CAG CAG CCG CGG TAA TAC; pE-F, AAA CTC AAA GGA ATT GAC GG; and pH-R, AAG GAG GTG ATC CAG CCG CA. PCR was performed using primers pA-F and pH-R. Cycle sequencing was performed using primers pC-F, pD-R, and pE-F and the BigDye terminator version 3.1 cycle sequencing kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis of the full 16S rRNA gene using Ripseq software (Isentio A.S, Bergen, Norway) gave a 100% match (1422\/1422 bp) to the 16S rRNA gene of N. thailandica type strain IFM 10145 (GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AB126874\",\"term_id\":\"51315279\"}}AB126874). The growth and morphology of the organism, along with the sequencing data, were consistent with the published description of N. thailandica, with the organism exhibiting tan\/beige colony growth at 35\u00b0C and typical branched mycelium branching into bacteroid, rod-shaped, Gram-positive elements (4, 5). Susceptibility testing using the CLSI-recommended method of broth microdilution revealed that the organism was susceptible to amikacin, ceftriaxone, meropenem, tobramycin, imipenem, amoxicillin clavulanate, clarithromycin, cefepime, minocycline, linezolid, moxifloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and resistant to ciprofloxacin (6). The patient was treated initially with a combination of TMP-SMX (2 double-strength tablets twice a day [BID]) and meropenem (1 g q8h); however, after 1 week of therapy, he developed hyperkalemia, which required changing the TMP-SMX to minocycline (100 mg BID). Meropenem was continued for 1 month before discontinuation, and plans are to continue minocycline for 6 to 12 months. Follow-up imaging 6 weeks into therapy documented an overall good response to therapy despite minimal enlargement of the right and left upper lobe opacities, with significant interval reduction in the size of the left upper lobe and left lower lobe opacities (Fig. 1E and \u200bandFF). N. thailandica was described by Kageyama et al. for the first time in a clinical wound specimen from a Thai patient in 2004 (4). Microscopically, N. thailandica is characterized by staining Gram positive and partially acid fast (4). The organisms usually appear as branched mycelia, which fragment into bacteroid rod-shaped elements ranging in size from 0.4 by 0.8 to 0.6 by 1.6 \u03bcm (4, 5). The colonies are white and rough and grow rapidly (2 to 3 days) to later develop a gray, orange-to-tan appearance (4). The organism is aerobic, and growth occurs at 30 to 37\u00b0C but not at 45\u00b0C on Mueller-Hinton II (MHII) agar with 0.2% glucose (4), as well as on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. Isolates exhibit an aerial mycelium, which is long and visible in most media (4, 5). The organism utilizes glucose and mannose as carbon sources but not arabinose, galactose, inositol, maltose, rhamnose, sorbitol, xylose, or citrate, and it is urease positive (5). Because of its strong similarity to other Nocardia species (4, 5), routine methods of identification may fail to recognize this agent; like many Nocardia species, it is relatively nonreactive biochemically, and many new species have been described that are indistinguishable using conventional methods (4, 5). Other methods, such as gene sequencing and mass spectrometry, are necessary for reliable identification of all the currently recognized species. Nocardia thailandica is closely related to N. asteroides, N. neocaledoniensis, and N. caishijiensis based on DNA-DNA relatedness data (4) and can be distinguished from these based on its distinct phenotypic properties (4, 5). However, major phenotypic characteristics reveal a pattern identical to that of Nocardia asteroides, precluding its differentiation from the aforementioned related species (4, 5). In this case, MALDI-TOF analysis using a routine formic acid-acetonitrile method failed to accurately identify the isolate, rendering a nonreliable result, probably due to the nature of the Nocardia cell wall. However, tentative identification to the genus level was possible after preparing the samples using the inactivated-Mycobacteria bead preparation method (Bruker Daltonics, Inc., Billerica, MA) and the modified standard Mycobacteria and Nocardia protocol (Vitek MS; bioM\u00e9rieux, France) which allowed breaking the cell wall of the organism to subsequently expose the targetable proteins by bead-beating mechanical disruption. Failure to identify this organism could also have resulted from the absence of representative reference spectra for certain species or protein variability among strains, as could have been the scenario for this case. To date, this species has been isolated only from purulent secretion from an abscess of a Thai patient (4), as well as patients with choroiditis and keratitis (7) in Asia; however, no other environmental source has been described, nor has close-contact transmission been reported for this species. Nevertheless, like other Nocardia species, N. thailandica appears to be an environmental agent that may act as an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised hosts (5). Though infrequent, pulmonary nocardiosis is important to recognize and treat, as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality (5). The use of immunosuppressants, such as those used after hematopoietic stem cell transplants and solid organ transplantation (in this case), have been reported as major risk factors for nocardial infection (8). In addition, older age (9) and preexisting structural abnormalities of the lung (10) are also associated with a higher risk of mortality in pulmonary nocardiosis. Interestingly, pulmonary aspergillosis is also an independent and significant risk factor for overall mortality in pulmonary nocardiosis patients (9). Stereotypically, our patient had undergone a heart transplant 9 months prior, was on immunosuppressive treatment, had significant underlying compromise of his lung function due to COPD, and had recently been diagnosed and treated for pulmonary aspergillosis. Nocardia infections cause a vast spectrum of potentially treatable disease that ranges from localized cutaneous infections to severe pulmonary and central nervous system involvement in immunocompromised hosts (5). Isolates that phenotypically resemble N. asteroides are usually divided into six different drug susceptibility patterns (5). However, while correct identification to species level allows the prediction of likely antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, infrequently reported species may pose a challenge, prompting susceptibility testing of all isolates (5, 11, 12). Our isolate proved susceptible to the majority of antimicrobials tested for Nocardia species, with the exception of ciprofloxacin, contrasting with other reported N. thailandica isolates (7), which exhibited completely different patterns, thus suggesting important interspecies variability and\/or methodological differences. While there have been no randomized controlled trials to allow the recommendation of an optimal therapy for pulmonary nocardiosis, in general, the agents most commonly used include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amikacin, carbapenems, and third-generation cephalosporins (5, 13), which were used successfully in our patient. In conclusion, Nocardia species are primarily opportunist organisms, and infection occurs more frequently in patients with underlying immune suppression (14). To date, N. thailandica has only been reported from wound and eye infections in Japan and India (4, 7). Thus, this is the first reported case of N. thailandica in the United States and the first report of pulmonary infection, suggesting an increasing role of N. thailandica as an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients and the broadening of its disease spectrum. In addition, this case highlights the importance of using a combined approach in Nocardia identification, the ever-increasing utility of novel diagnostic platforms like MALDI-TOF MS for its identification, and the need for microbial databases for advanced diagnostic methods to be continually checked and updated to include rare, novel, geographically limited, and emerging pathogens.

About 1 to 179 new cases of Nocardia infections are reported in China each year since 2009, and Nocardia farcinica was the most commonly isolated species (39.9%) (4).

Species of Nocardia involved in human pathogenesis include Nocardia brasiliensis, Guinea pig nocardia and Picrax nocardia. Nocardiosis is a life-threatening disease (5) usually found in immunocompromised patients, or populations where it occurs secondary to other diseases. The lung is the most common site of nocardiosis, accounting for about 70\u201380% (6, 7). Disseminated infections caused by Nocardia usually affect immunocompromised patients (8), and typically originate in the lungs, then spread to the brain. However, an individual with normal immune function and disseminated nocardiosis which originated in the lungs and spread to the brain, causing brain abscess, has been reported (9). Nocardia bacteremia is an extremely severe form of disseminated nocardiosis, the mortality rate may account for approximately 60% (10). However, to the best of our knowledge, Nocardia vulneris always manifests as skin and\/or subcutaneous tissue infections, and though there are no previous reports on its role in disseminated infections, here, we present a case of disseminated Nocardia vulneris infection. Nocardia do not constitute as a part of the human normal flora; therefore, it can be diagnosed as nocardiosis when these organisms are isolated from sputum, alveolar lavage fluid, blood, pus, pleural fluid, subcutaneous tissues, or other samples. In the case reported here, the patient was undergoing immunosuppressant and steroid treatment for macroglobulinemia for 4 years. He was admitted to the hospital suffering from a 1-month history of repeated cough associated with sputum, repeated fever, and shortness of breath. In addition, the patient reported a 1-week history of limb muscle pain, interphalangeal joint pain, and headache. A blood culture was started upon admission, and the aerobic blood culture was positive after 35 h. Gram-positive red filamentous branching bacterial groups were found in the smear. Although visible in the phlegm or alveolar lavage fluid direct smear specimens, stained by wright-giemsa staining and weak acid-fast dye, it is also easily be concealed by other bacteria which grow rapidly, so microscopic examination of the smear is very important in early diagnosis. In addition, Nocardia grow slowly, usually taking 72 h to form small colonies, so medical personnel should extend the time of bacteria culture to avoid the problems of misdiagnosis. Of note, small microflora could be seen which came from the positive blood culture, and were transferred to the blood plate for 24 h. This may be the reason that nutrient solution in the blood cultures could neutralize the antibiotics or antibacterial factors which remained in the specimen and made bacteria grow quickly. Because it is time-consuming and difficult for the traditional microbial identification method to identify the species of Nocardia, it does not meet the needs of the accurate and rapid clinical identification of pathogenic bacteria. However, mass spectrometry, and other modern molecular biology technologies, especially PCR and gene sequencing, could provide a good foundation for rapid identification of Nocardia species. A recent report has shown that 91% of the Nocardia species could be accurately identified by the mass spectrometry system VITEK MS (11). In this case, the species identified by mass spectrometry and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was incorrect, possibly because the species Nocardia vulneris was not in the library of the mass spectrometry system Bruker (Bruker Company, Bruker MALDI Biotyper TOF, America) and VITEK MS (BioMerieux Company, BioMerieux VITEK MS, China), so the organism was identified as Nocardia brasiliensis by Bruker and VITEK MS. This report suggests that 16S rRNA gene sequencing method should be adopted, and the library of the mass spectrometry system should be upgraded frequently or combined with the results of gene sequencing. Sulfonamides have long been considered the first line of drug treatment in nocardiosis; however, a report regarding the antibiotic susceptibility of Nocardia showed that the resistance rate of Nocardia against sulfonamides is 57%, and the mortality rate is higher when it is used alone (12). For immunosuppressed patients or patients with disseminated infections, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole monotherapy has been changed to amikacin combined with imipenem or linezolid, which is for central nervous system infections or multidrug-resistant bacterial infections (13\u201315). In this case, as the results of the direct blood culture smear were received that pointed to suspected Nocardia infection, the patient was treated by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combined with meropenem for 3 days. Given that the patient still displayed a high fever, the treatment was changed to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combined with ceftriaxone for 2 days, but the patient's symptoms persisted. Following treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combined with linezolid for 1 day, which showed no efficacy, the MIC values of linezolid, amikacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were confirmed and the treatment was changed to the combination of linezolid, amikacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole due to the severity of the illness. Concomitantly, because the patient had extremely poor renal function, the clinical pharmacists reduced the dosage of amikacin to prevent further renal function damage; the patient's temperature showed a decreasing trend after treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combined with linezolid and amikacin for 1 day. After treatment for 15 days, the patient's infection symptoms had largely resolved. Thereafter, the patient was treated with an oral combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and minocycline for 6 months, without any relapse after treatment cessation. The successful treatment of this case fully demonstrates that the MIC value of the drug sensitivity test should be ascertained when there is a wide choice of drugs available. In addition, multidisciplinary cooperation may be warranted and can effectively significantly improve the success rate of treatment. Scott et al. reported a case in which retinitis caused by Nocardia veterana was successfully treated by a combination of linezolid, amikacin, and meropenem (16). For the cases which are diagnosed, patients should be treated for at least 12 months with antimicrobial therapy. Bacteriological examination and antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be performed regularly. In addition, according to the antimicrobial sensitivity testing, the treatment regimen should be adjusted with the appropriate monitoring, and follow-ups are required to determine whether the patient relapsed after cessation of the treatment."}]}]},{"species":"Nocardia asiatica","docs":[{"title":"Brain abscess caused by Nocardia asiatica","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Nocardia asiatica cause?","id":"317-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"brain abscess","answer_start":176,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are N. asiatica sensitive to?","id":"317-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole","answer_start":634,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Nocardia infection of the central nervous system leading to brain abscess is a rare condition but has a high mortality rate.

CNS nocardiosis most frequently manifests as brain abscesses, however, in rare cases as meningitis or spinal cord infections.[2] Nocardia brain abscess accounts for only 2% of all brain abscesses.[2,11] Their clinical course is typically gradual and insidious over months, or even years, making early diagnosis and identification difficult.[9] The lesions are usually supratentorial (57%) rather than infratentorial.[11] Multiple abscesses are reported in 38% of the patients with CNS nocardiosis.[11] The coalescence of multiple daughter abscesses results in the formation of multiloculated abscesses.[14] Nocardia brain abscess carries mortality rates of 55% and 20% in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients, respectively. These rates are higher than those associated with other bacterial brain abscesses (10%).[11] In case of multiple abscesses, the mortality rate rises to 66%.[11] The standard medical treatment for Nocardia brain abscesses is trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole.[11] Aspiration or surgical excision may be indicated for abscesses >2.5 cm. Craniotomy and excision of the entire abscess and capsule are more effective than aspiration and drainage, particularly when the abscess is resistant to antimicrobial agents.[11] Diagnosis is mainly based on bacteriological cultures; 82% of patients are diagnosed with cultures of aspirates from the site of infection, 31% based on the biopsy specimen, and 8.3% following cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture.[1] However, the slow growth of Nocardia species and contamination of the cultures by other, faster-growing bacteria frequently lead to a delayed diagnosis.[2,10] Moreover, the demonstration of Nocardia in a CSF culture is usually difficult because empirical therapy is typically initiated before the CSF is collected. Lumbar puncture is contraindicated in patients with brain abscess because of the risk of brain herniation. These features of Nocardia infection support the utility of 16S rRNA sequencing for the rapid identification of Nocardia species. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of Nocardia has become a valuable tool for accurate species-level identification. In fact, application of this method has resulted in the identification of new species of Nocardia.[4] Of these, N. asiatica was first described in 2004, following its isolation from patients in Japan and Thailand.[7] Since then, N. asiatica has been identified in patients with pulmonary infections, skin infections, and brain abscess; these cases have been documented both inside and outside of Asia.[5,6,8,12,15,16,17,18] However, to date, only four cases of N. asiatica brain abscess, including the present case, have been reported in the literature [Table 1].[5,15,18] In three of these patients, including our patient, the capsule was excised. The long-term survival of all patients was achieved by antibiotic treatment, mainly trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole.

The genus Nocardia is composed of 13 medically important species, of which N. asteroides, N. farcina, N. nova, and N. abscessus cause the majority of invasive infections (1). Nocardia asiatica was newly isolated by Kageyama et al. from three N. asteroides-like strains obtained in Japan and Thailand in 2004 (2). To date, only a few case reports have described N. asiatica infections, and details of the nocardiosis caused by this strain are unclear. Nocardia species can cause localized or systemic suppurative diseases in humans and animals. The lung is the major target organ involved in Nocardia infections because the main portal of entry is inhalation (3). The main risk factor for nocardiosis is immunosuppression, such as that induced by prolonged corticosteroid therapy, malignancy, organ transplantation, or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was identified as the first human oncogenic retrovirus 30 years ago (4). In southern Japan, the prevalence of HTLV-1 in the general population is more than 10%, making it the area with the highest HTLV-1 prevalence worldwide (5).

In this case, although Gram staining and Kinyoun's acid-fast staining from pleural effusions both showed negative findings, we identified N. asiatica using colonies cultured from pleural effusions by MALDI-TOF-MS. The genus Nocardia includes more than 80 species, of which at least 33 cause diseases in humans (7,8). Determination of the Nocardia species causing an infection is important because different species vary in their epidemiology, virulence, and antibiotic susceptibility. Traditional methods for the determination of Nocardia species include biochemical tests and susceptibility profiling, but the identification of Nocardia species in such tests is often difficult. To overcome these limitations, sequencing methods, such as 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (16S rRNA) gene sequencing, have been advocated for Nocardia species identification, but they remain unavailable in clinical practice. Recently, MALDI-TOF-MS, which can analyze the protein composition of a bacterial cell, has been identified as a rapid and accurate method for the identification of Nocardia species in clinical laboratories (9,10). N. asiatica is a rare Nocardia species that was newly identified in 2004. There are few reports describing N. asiatica infections, including respiratory infections such as pneumonia and mediastinal infections (11,12). We conducted a systematic review of relevant articles in the Medline database using the term \u201cNocardia asiatica.\u201d We identified a total of 24 articles, including 15 case reports of N. asiatica infections (Table 3). Non-English articles were excluded from this study. With the increasing popularity of MALDI-TOF-MS, N. asiatica may be detected as a causative pathogen more frequently, as in this case. Literature Review of N. asiatica Infections.

In general, several drug regimens based on TMP-SMX as a key drug are recommended as first-line therapy for some cases of severe pulmonary nocardiosis (13). Susceptibility tests for all clinically significant Nocardia isolates are recommended because antimicrobial susceptibility patterns vary among different studies, countries, and Nocardia species. Unfortunately, we were unable to perform a susceptibility test; therefore, based on our literature review, we empirically treated the patient with TMP-SMX, MINO, IMP\/CS, and AMPC\/CVA. Although we were unable to continue TMP-SMX in this patient due to renal dysfunction, treatment with MINO and AMPC\/CVA was successful. Determining the optimal treatment regimen for N. asiatica infections will require further study. One review showed that 64% of 1,050 patients with nocardiosis were immunocompromised (14). The most common causes of immunosuppression were glucocorticoid therapy, malignancy, organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and HIV infection. In the present case, the patient had bladder cancer (cTaN0M0, cStage 0a) and prostate cancer (cT4N1M1b, cStage IV). Although these cancers may have been responsible for the nocardiosis, both cancers were stable. Furthermore, he was only administered goserelin acetate, which is a hormonal drug, for prostate cancer and had never been treated with chemotherapy. Initially, we were unable to recognize his immunosuppressive status which induced empyema caused by Nocardia except for malignancy. Since the numbers of atypical lymphocytes were rapidly increased in his peripheral blood after admission, we were able to detect the presence of ATL during the treatment of empyema. ATL is a peripheral T-cell malignancy caused by HTLV-1, an oncogenic human RNA retrovirus (15). Southwestern Japan is one of the most endemic areas for its associated malignancy, along with the Caribbean basin, Central and South America, and Western Africa (16). The patient was born in Nagasaki Prefecture on the northwest side of Kyusyu, in southwestern Japan. The frequency of opportunistic infections among HTLV-1 carriers and ATL patients is 1.5% and 6.5%, respectively. The pathogenic microorganisms are diverse, including Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, Pneumocystis, and Cytomegalovirus (17). Although the mechanisms underlying immunosuppression in ATL patients remain obscure, a reduced CD4-positive T-cell function due to HTLV-1 infection has been proposed to be a causative mechanism (18,19). Aggressive chemotherapy may be required to kill HTLV-1-infected CD4-positive T cells, but this increases the risk of further immunosuppression and opportunistic infections. We were unable to administer treatment for ATL to this patient, since his ADL declined during the treatment of nocardiosis. In conclusion, we encountered a rare case of ATL that became apparent during the treatment of pulmonary abscess and empyema due to N. asiatica. Clinicians should consider the potential of N. asiatica to cause pulmonary infections, including empyema, and at the diagnosis of nocardiosis, they should investigate the possibility of disease-producing immunosuppression, including ATL, as in this case."}]}]},{"species":"Kocuria kristinae","docs":[{"title":"Kocuria kristinae pneumonia and bacteremia","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Kocuria kristinae is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"318-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-positive","answer_start":33,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Kocuria kristinae normally exist?","id":"318-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"skin","answer_start":84,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Kocuria kristinae cause?","id":"318-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"community-acquired pneumonia and bacteremia","answer_start":176,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Kocuria kristinae's requirement for oxygen?","id":"318-1-1-4","answers":[{"text":"aerobic","answer_start":25,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Kocuria kristinae is an aerobic gram-positive bacterium that is part of the normal skin flora and not a common cause of infection.

It was first described by Duan et al. [2], who reported KE in 1 out of 330 cases in their retrospective study. Clinical presentation can be delayed, ranging from 1 to 30 days from the inciting event [2, 4, 5]. Table \u200bTable11 summarizes all published cases of KE in the literature, to date. Kocuria has been identified on intravitreal needles and ocular surfaces despite sterilization of the conjunctival surface [6]. Post-intravitreal KE by culture-positive K. kristinae presenting 5 days after intravitreal bevacizumab was described by Alles et al. [5]. Our patient had trauma 2 weeks prior to the diagnosis of endophthalmitis. While there was no clinical sign of a penetrating wound, there may have been an occult open globe injury. Dave et al. [4] in 2018 described 8 eyes affected by KE. Similar to our patient, 5 of the 8 cases were post-traumatic in etiology, 3 of which were classified as K. kristinae. Summary of the published cases reporting KE In our internal review of over 250 endophthalmitis isolates at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute from 2014 to 2020, we were only able to identify this 1 case of KE. Phenotypic assays used for Kocuria may often misidentify it as coagulase-negative Staphylococci [7]. Most clinical microbiology laboratories have limited access to advanced molecular techniques for precise identification, especially given its similarities to Staphylococcus and Micrococcus species [8, 9]. In addition, Kocuria may have a variable phenotypic behavior in vitro, especially under stress conditions [8]. Isolates were identified using an automated ID system (Vitek2; BioMerieux, Raleigh, NC, USA). Advanced techniques would involve using polymerase chain reaction and 16S analyses to confirm bacteria and then sequencing and\/or polymerase chain reaction with Kocuria-specific primers. Despite reported resistance to furazolidone and bacitracin, Kocuria has a generally favorable susceptibility pattern and can be treated with antibiotics such as vancomycin, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and cefuroxime (Table \u200b(Table1)1) [2, 3, 4, 5]. The literature shows few Kocuria cases with resistance to amikacin and cefazolin [4]. Our clinical case was pansensitive to antimicrobials and thus had a good response to intravitreal antimicrobials at presentation. A lens-sparing PPV was effective in removing vision-obscuring vitreous opacities following resolution of KE. Dave and colleagues [4] described complete resolution of KE in 75% of the cases. However, final VA of 20\/100 or better was achieved only in 38% of patients. Our case improved from LP to 20\/50 in only 2 months, which is the best visual outcome reported in the literature to date following KE. In conclusion, differentiating Kocuria from other similar organisms can help guide treatment, as KE generally responds well to standard empiric antibiotics [10]. A clinical suspicion for KE should be present in cases of endophthalmitis occurring within 1 month from a clinical history suspicious for ocular trauma."}]},{"title":"Kocuria kristinae in catheter associated urinary tract infection: a case report","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Kocuria kristinae is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"318-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram positive","answer_start":23,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Kocuria kristinae normally exist?","id":"318-3-1-2","answers":[{"text":"skin and mucous membranes","answer_start":92,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Kocuria kristinae cause?","id":"318-3-1-3","answers":[{"text":"urinary tract infection","answer_start":403,"id":1},{"text":"catheter related urinary tract infection","answer_start":532,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Kocuria kristinae?","id":"318-3-1-4","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic infections","answer_start":254,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Kocuria kristinae?","id":"318-3-1-5","answers":[{"text":"coccus","answer_start":37,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Kocuria kristinae is a gram positive coccus of the family of Micrococcacae.

Kocuria kristinae, which frequently colonizes the skin, mucosa and human oropharynx and is generally isolated from a wide variety of animal sources and soil [1\u20133], can cause severe infections, mainly in hospital settings. They have been found to be responsible for causing endocarditis and central venous cateter-related bacteraemia in patients with ovarian cancer [2,3] and acute leukaemia [4] and in pregnant females [5]. Apart from bacteraemia, reports of cholecystitis in immunocompetent hosts, as well as dialysis related peritonitis [6\u20138] have also been documented. So far, no case of a urinary tract infection with Kocuria kristinae has been reported. Our patient was a healthy adult, except that he was implanted with a catheter, which can be correlated somewhere with the association between indwelling devices and K. kristinae. In the reported cases of K. kristinae infections so far, the organisms were reported to be susceptible to many commonly used antibiotics, which include penicillins, macrolides, clindamycin, trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin and fluoroquinolones [2,3,8]. A literature report on 219 strains of Kocuria and Micrococcus showed that a majority of strains were sensitive to doxycycline, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, amikacin, and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, but resistant to ampicillin and erythromycin [10]. In another case, K. kristinae was found to be sensitive to ceftazidime, ceftriaxon, cefotaxim, cefpodoxim proxetil, gentamycin, amikacin, netilmicin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, imipenem, ertapenem, ceftazidim with clavulanate and vancomycin, but to be resistant to amoxicillin. Although, till now, K. kristinae has been documented to be sensitive to many antibiotics, our isolate was found to be highly resistant to all the drugs by disk diffusion method. As our patient was admitted to Unani IPD and as he was on Unani syrups (Septran, etc), but was not getting any relief, antibiotic sensitivity was performed. Antibiotics can be tried in Unani patients, but our strain was resistant to all the drugs which were tested. Antibiotics were not started. Patient did not visit the hospital for follow up . Unfortunately, we have no idea of outcome of that patient. Generally, the infections which are caused by this species are very rare, but they could be recognized certainly by modern highly automated identification systems [5]. There are reports on erroneous identifications of coagulase-negative Staphylococci as Kocuria spp. by the VITEK 2 system due to its phenotypic variability [9]. Due to lack of facilities, we did not confirm our isolate of K. kristinae by genotyping. We believe that modern VITEK 2 compact automated system with a GP card which was covered by the corresponding database, was quite a reliable tool for identification of Kocuria kristinae in our patient [11]. Although, it was previously considered as a harmless microorganism, many reports have described the association of this organism with severe infections. Also the changing clinical spectrum of K. kristinae from immuno-compromised to immuno-competent patients and change in its antimicrobial susceptibility towards resistance to many drugs is a matter of concern and it should be tackled by making sincere efforts. Physicians should not underestimate importance of K. kristinae if it is isolated in lab in any clinical specimen. In near future, with more reports coming in, its clinical spectrum will become more clear."}]},{"title":"Antimicrobial treatment of Kocuria kristinae invasive infections: Systematic review","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of drugs are K. kristinae sensitive to?","id":"318-4-1-1","answers":[{"text":"vancomycin, linezolid, rifampicin, teicoplanin, tigecycline, cefotaxime, ampicillin\/sulbactam, minocycline and meropenem","answer_start":826,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Objective of this systematic review was to establish whether and what invasive infections in humans were caused by Kocuria kristinae, and to evaluate outcomes of administered antibiotic treatment.

This bacterial species alternates between short replication phases of 20-40 generations that strictly require infection of the host, normally causing death, interrupted by relatively long, mostly dormant phases as spores in the environment. Hence, the B. anthracis genome is highly homogeneous. This feature and the fact that strains from nearly all parts of the world have been analysed for canonical single nucleotide polymorphisms (canSNPs) and variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) has allowed the development of molecular epidemiological and molecular clock models to estimate the age of major diversifications in the evolution of B. anthracis and to trace the global spread of this pathogen, which was mostly promoted by movement of domestic cattle with settlers and by international trade of contaminated animal products. From a taxonomic and phylogenetic point of view, B. anthracis is a member of the Bacillus cereus group. The differentiation of B. anthracis from B. cereus sensu stricto, solely based on chromosomal markers, is difficult. However, differences in pathogenicity clearly differentiate B. anthracis from B. cereus and are marked by the strict presence of virulence genes located on the two virulence plasmids pXO1 and pXO2, which both are required by the bacterium to cause anthrax. Conversely, anthrax-like symptoms can also be caused by organisms with chromosomal features that are more closely related to B. cereus, but which carry these virulence genes on two plasmids that largely resemble the B. anthracis virulence plasmids.

Like all Bacillus species, B. anthracis is a Gram-positive spore-former that is commonly found in the soil. Unlike most other Bacillus species, respiratory, gastrointestinal, or cutaneous entry of B. anthracis spores into mammals can result in systemic infection and lethal disease. Spores are considered to be the predominant form of B. anthracis outside of a host, but upon infection, spores germinate to become vegetative cells that can replicate to high numbers in virtually all body tissues. Death of the host and contact of infected tissues with air results in a return to the spore form of the bacterium. As is true for all Bacillus species, B. anthracis spores are highly resistant to adverse environmental conditions, but it has been proposed that B. anthracis is more dependent than other Bacillus species on sporulation for species survival (Turnbull, 2002). Vegetative cells appear to survive poorly in simple environments including water and bulk soil (Lindeque and Turnbull, 1994; Saile and Koehler, 2006; Turnbull, 2002). Thus, the spore - vegetative cell \u2013 spore cycle is essential for the pathogenic lifestyle of this developmental bacterium. The evolution of B. anthracis and its relatedness to other Bacillus species is intriguing. B. anthracis is a member of the \u201cgroup 1 bacilli\u201d also known as the \u201cB. cereus group\u201d, which also includes B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, B. mycoides, B. pseudomycoides, and B. weihenstephanensis (Ash and Collins, 1992; Ash et al., 1991; Helgason et al., 2000; Helgason et al., 2004; Lechner et al., 1998; Rasko et al., 2005; Tourasse et al., 2006; Turnbull, 1999). The B. cereus group species exhibit remarkably similar cell structure, physiology, and natural genetic exchange systems but they are distinct with regard to pathogenicity. In large part, species-specific pathogenicity is associated with plasmid content. B. anthracis is distinguished by its virulence plasmids pXO1 (182 kb), which contains the structural genes for the anthrax toxin proteins, pagA (PA), lef (LF) and cya (EF), (Koehler, 2002) and pXO2 (96 kb), which carries the biosynthetic operon for capsule, capBCADE (Candela et al., 2005; Makino et al., 1989; Okinaka et al., 1999a). Although pXO1 and pXO2 are considered to be specific to B. anthracis, there are some reports of rare B. cereus strains harboring plasmids with similarity to these plasmids (Avashia et al., 2007; Hoffmaster et al., 2004; Klee et al., 2006; Rasko et al., 2007). Some of these unusual strains have been isolated from humans and animals that succumbed to an anthrax-like disease. Phenotypes conferred by plasmid genes have been the focus of many investigations comparing B. anthracis to related species. Nevertheless, not all unique attributes of B. anthracis are plasmid-associated. Plasmid-cured strains of the species exhibit some species-specific phenotypes despite the striking degree of sequence similarity and gene synteny associated with the chromosomes (Rasko et al., 2005)."}]}]},{"species":"Arcobacter cryaerophilus","docs":[{"title":"Arcobacter cryaerophilus Isolated From New Zealand Mussels Harbor a Putative Virulence Plasmid","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Arcobacter cryaerophilus normally exist?","id":"320-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"greenshell mussels","answer_start":534,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Arcobacter cryaerophilus cause?","id":"320-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"human gastroenteritis","answer_start":475,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" A wide range of Arcobacter species have been described from shellfish in various countries but their presence has not been investigated in Australasia, in which shellfish are a popular delicacy.

This facultative anaerobic Gram-positive rod is part of the urinary microbiota of healthy patients. It is responsible for UTIs, particularly in elderly men and young children. A. schaalii is an underestimated cause of UTIs because of its fastidious growth on usual media and difficulties associated with its identification using phenotypic methods. Indeed, this slow-growth bacterium requires blood-enriched media and an incubation time of 48 hours under anaerobic or 5% CO2 atmosphere. Furthermore, only matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) or molecular-based methods allow the accurate identification of this bacteria. MALDI-TOF using Microflex LT with the Biotyper database (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) is the most reliable technology for the routine identification of A. schaalii. The identification of this uropathogen is all the more important because it is resistant to trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole and second-generation quinolones that are widely used in the treatment of UTIs. Antimicrobial therapy using \u03b2-lactams prolonged for up to 2 weeks is the most efficient treatment and should be recommended. Microbiologists should assess the presence of A. schaalii in urine using appropriate culture and identification methods in the case of a direct examination that is positive for small coccoid rods, a negative nitrite urinary stick associated with leukocyturia, treatment failure with trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole or fluoroquinolones, or undocumented, repeated UTIs.

Pathogenic treponemes cause multi-stage infections like endemic syphilis, venereal syphilis, yaws and pinta. These infections have many similarities, but they can be differentiated based on epidemiological, clinical and geographical criteria [1\u20133]. Primarily, the pathogenic treponemes can be classified based on the clinical symptoms of the respective disease they cause. Treponema pallidum subsp. endemicum causes endemic syphilis; T. pallidum subsp. pallidum causes venereal syphilis; T. pallidum subsp. pertenue causes yaws; and T. pallidum subsp. carateum causes pinta. Out of these four high morbidity diseases, venereal syphilis is only transmitted by sexual contact; the other three diseases are transmitted by close personal contact [2]. It is estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) that there are 12 million new cases of syphilis annually and the aggregated cases of yaws, bejel, and pinta (the endemic treponematoses) are approximately 2.5 million globally, although good surveillance data is not available. The infections caused by T. pallidum are characterized by periods of active clinical disease interrupted by episodes of asymptomatic latent infection and may cause life-long infections in untreated individuals [4, 5]. Treponema pallidum is a Gram-negative, motile, spirochete human pathogen. Syphilis is a multistage infectious disease that can be communicated between sexual partners through active lesions or from an infected woman to her fetus during pregnancy [6, 7]. Syphilis has a worldwide distribution (e.g. Africa has a high incidence), affecting every country and continent except perhaps Antarctica [8\u201312]. The stages of syphilis have been divided on the basis of clinical findings that lead to treatment and follow-up. Syphilis chancres may go unnoticed primarily due to their well-documented painless nature and if they are present in those parts of the body that are difficult to visualize (e.g. cervix, throat or anus\/rectum) [13]. Furthermore, due to pleomorphic appearance and lack of physician familiarity with the expressions of syphilis, their lesions may be misdiagnosed. Secondary, syphilis may manifest itself through severe rashes that may go unobserved by the patient or may mimic an extensive condition [8]. T. pallidum is completely sensitive to penicillin treatment, despite the use of this antibiotic for seven decades in treating syphilis infections. Standard treatment of uncomplicated syphilis with parenteral Benzathine penicillin G is highly effective at all stages. Many antibiotics\u2019 resistance (e.g Macrolide and Clindamycin resistance) has been reported in several countries [6]. The ongoing high rate of syphilis worldwide, despite the availability of inexpensive and effective treatment, presents the most convincing argument for the need of developing new and potent vaccine against syphilis [14]. Despite the WHO\u2019s Initiative for the Global Elimination of Congenital Syphilis, an intensive syphilis-targeted public health control has been undertaken to reduce the incidence; however, it has not been achieved yet [14]. Specifically, the reasons for failure are multifactorial; some of the responsibility can be attributed to the difficulty in the diagnosis of syphilis and treatment, and lack of access or use of prenatal screening programs [15]. The advancement in the field of genomics and cost-effective sequencing technologies has transformed the human bacterial pathogens study and helped in the improvement of vaccine designing technologies. A new and emerging methodology to get deep insight of the genome of a species or genus is the pan-genomics approach, which was introduced by Tettelin and collaborators in 2005 working with Streptococcus agalactiae [16]. Pan-genome provides us with the complete and non-redundant collection of genes from a species or genus and is composed of three subsets (core genome, shared genome and singletons): the core genome, which is the collection of all the genes commonly shared between all the genomes used as dataset; the shared genome, which contains only the genes shared between two or more strains, which are not present in all strains of the dataset; and, the singletons, which are present only in one strain and are referred to as strain-specific genes. The first genome of T. pallidum subsp. pallidum (strain Nichols) was sequenced in 1998. The organism has a comparatively small genome and only 55% of T. pallidum\u2019s 1041 open reading frames are recognized to have a biological function, which indicates that it uses host biosynthesis to complete some of its metabolic needs [3]. The DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed homology between DNA of venereal syphilis spirochete and DNA of culturable treponemes (T. phagedenis and its biotypes Reiter and Kazan) was less than 5% identical, but was indistinguishable from DNA of the yaws spirochete T. pallidum [3, 17, 18]. This study led to the reclassification of the agents of endemic syphilis, venereal syphilis and yaws as T. pallidum subsp. endemicum, Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum and T. pallidum subsp. pertenue, respectively. Genomic sequencing has recognized these subspecies as clonal, but forming distinct genetic clusters [2, 3]. In this work, we perform a pan-genome approach to better understand the differences of Treponema pallidum infections in the broad spectrum and how genome plasticity is related to the symptom patterns. For pan-genomic comparative analyses, we used 53 T. pallidum strains. We present phylo-genomic correlations between all T. pallidum strains. Furthermore, we describe the \u201cpan-genome\u201d, which is the complete inventory of genes found in any member of the species; the \u201ccore genome\u201d, which is important for basic life processes; and the \u201csingletons\u201d, which are normally related to environmental fitness and adaptation to host. Finally, we provide insights into the specific subsets (singletons and the pan- and core genomes) of 53 genomes of T pallidum strains and correlate these subsets with the plasticity of pathogenicity islands and virulence genes."}]}]},{"species":"Treponema parvum","docs":[{"title":"Treponema parvum sp. nov., a small, glucoronic or galacturonic acid-dependent oral spirochaete from lesions of human periodontitis and acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Treponema parvum normally exist?","id":"328-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"European patients with periodontitis","answer_start":130,"id":1},{"text":"Chinese patients with either gingivitis or acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG)","answer_start":176,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Small oral spirochaetes with a strict dependence on either glucuronic acid (GluA) or galacturonic acid (GalA) were isolated from European patients with periodontitis and from Chinese patients with either gingivitis or acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG).

However, four isolates differed from T. pectinovorum by their small cell size, by a prominent beta-glucuronidase activity, by a distinct protein and antigen profile, by an inability to grow on pectin as sole source of carbohydrate and by a markedly enhanced growth rate when supplied with a second carbohydrate (L-arabinose, D-galactose, D-glucose, D-fructose, D-mannitol, D-mannose, pectin, D-ribose or D-xylose) in addition to the essential GluA\/GalA.

They are obligate aerobes which form a yellow colony when grown on solid media. Most strains grow at 37\u00b0C and all strains grow at 30\u00b0C. E. brevis are positive for catalase, oxidase, and phosphatase and produce indole [1, 2]. These organisms are widely distributed in soil, water, and plants but remain an unusual cause of infections in humans. E. brevis can also be found in the hospital environment, leading to rare cases of nosocomial infections [3\u20135]. Usually, E. brevis is susceptible to several classes of antibiotics including beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. However, treatment of infections caused by E. brevis can be complicated by the presence of a chromosome-encoded Ambler class B beta-lactamase, which confers decreased susceptibility to extended spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems [6]. A review of literature revealed only four reports of E. brevis infections. A series of eleven patients with E. brevis endophthalmitis after uncomplicated cataract surgery was reported from Germany [4]. The patients had undergone cataract extraction surgery, performed by the same surgeon, 1\u20136 days before presentation. All 11 subjects were found to have E. brevis growing from intraocular cultures. They were treated with intravitreal vancomycin and amikacin in addition to ophthalmologic interventions and had good clinical outcomes. Culture of the solutions used for irrigation, intraocular lenses, tap water, and surgical instruments did not grow the organism. A problem with the sterilization process was considered the possible cause of this outbreak.  E. brevis was implicated as a cause of cellulitis in an 83-year-old patient from Japan [7]. The patient presented with erythema, blisters, and purpura of her right foot. Skin biopsy showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis and culture grew E. brevis. The infection resolved after treatment with intravenous minocycline.  E. brevis has also been reported to cause ventriculostomy-associated infections [3]. A retrospective review of 28 cases of meningitis in patients with ventriculostomy from Taiwan showed one infection to be caused by E. brevis.

This nosocomial pathogen can cause several human infections, especially among immunocompromised patients. Here, we describe the whole genome sequence of a clinical W. falsenii strain isolated from a urine sample of a 35-year-old woman with a urinary tract infection in Tunisia. We investigated its phenotype and genotype. After bacterial identification by the MALDI-TOF method, the whole-genome sequencing of this strain was performed. This isolate was not susceptible to various antibiotics, including \u03b2-lactams, aminoglycosides, and quinolones. However, it remains susceptible to imipenem (MIC = 0.25 mg\/l), ertapenem (MIC = 0.75 mg\/l), and meropenem (MIC = 0.19 mg\/l). Interestingly, the E-TEST (MP\/MPI) showed a reduced MIC of meropenem +\/- EDTA (0.064 \u03bcg\/ml). Besides, the color change from yellow to red in the \u03b2 CARBA test only after 24 hours of incubation can be interpreted in two ways. On the one hand, as a likely low expression of the gene encoding metallo-\u03b2-lactamase. On the other hand, and more likely, it may be a false-positive result because, according to the test manufacturer's recommendations, the test should be read after 30 minutes. Perhaps, therefore, this gene is not expressed in the tested strain. Moreover, the whole-genome sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of a novel chromosomally located subclass B1 metallo-\u03b2-lactamase EBR-like enzyme, sharing 94.92% amino acid identity with a previously described carbapenemase produced by Empedobacter brevis, EBR-1. The results also showed the detection of other antibiotic resistance genes and the absence of plasmids. So far, this study is the first report on the detection of W. falsenii in Tunisia. These findings prove that W. falsenii could be a potential reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes, e.g., \u03b2-lactamases. Collaborative efforts and effective hygiene measures should be established to prevent the emergence of this species in our health care settings.

E. falsenii comb. nov. is a nonmotile Gram-negative rod that grows aerobically at 20, 30, and 37\u00b0C on standard medium, such as tryptic soy agar or blood agar. In the year 2012, the first isolation of Wautersiella falsenii from a urine sample of an infant with a complicated urinary tract infection was described (3). E. falsenii comb. nov. strain Wf282 was isolated from a cervical neck abscess sample from an 18-year-old female patient who was admitted to the otolaryngology service with acute otitis media. The nonfermenting Gram-negative rods were identified as E. falsenii using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS) (Bruker, Germany), with a score of 2.074 (probable species-level identification). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the Vitek 2 system, employing the panel AST-079 (Gram-negative susceptibility [GNS] card). The MIC results were interpreted using the CLSI breakpoints (4) for other non-Enterobacteriaceae, except for ampicillin, cephalothin, and cefoxitin, for which those for Enterobacteriaceae were used. E. falsenii comb. nov. strain Wf282 was resistant to ampicillin (\u226532 \u00b5g\/ml), ampicillin-sulbactam (\u226532 \u00b5g\/ml), cephalothin (\u226532 \u00b5g\/ml), meropenem (\u226516 \u00b5g\/ml), and colistin (8 \u00b5g\/ml); intermediate to piperacillin-tazobactam (64 \u00b5g\/ml), cefotaxime (16 \u00b5g\/ml), ceftazidime (16 \u00b5g\/ml), imipenem (8 \u00b5g\/ml), and ciprofloxacin (2 \u00b5g\/ml); and susceptible to cefepime (4 \u00b5g\/ml), amikacin (8 \u00b5g\/ml), gentamicin (2 \u00b5g\/ml), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (2 \u00b5g\/ml). Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed using Illumina MiSeq-I, using Nextera XT libraries for sample preparation. The reads were assembled with the Ray assembler (http:\/\/denovoassembler.sourceforge.net). A total of 1,076,192 high-quality paired-end reads were produced, with an average insertion size of 825 bp. De novo assembly was performed with the SPAdes assembler version 3.1.0 (5), using a preassembly approach with Velvet (6). Of the generated reads, 99.9% were mapped, resulting in a mean nucleotide coverage of 65\u00d7 (and a k-mer coverage of 29.9). The corrected reads showed an average length of 230 bp. The assembled contigs sum 3,738,626 base pairs, with an N50 contig size of 113,944 (max length, 279,129) and a G+C content of 32.24%. Since this isolate is resistant to many antibiotics, including meropenem and colistin, the future detailed analysis of the genome of this strain (Wf282) might lead us to find novel antibiotic resistance traits that may explain its phenotype, as well as its potential role as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes.

This Gram-negative bacillus is classified within the alphaproteobacteria in the family Bradyrhizobiaceae. Like Legionella spp., which are also amoeba-associated microorganisms, it grows well on BCYE agar but weakly or not at all on Columbia sheep blood agar. The genus Afipia currently includes 5 species (A. birgiae, A. broomeae, A. clevelandensis, A. felis, and A. massiliensis) and several genospecies, and many other probable new species have been detected in water and soil (15). Members of the genus are common in water, including hospital water supplies, and are suspected to be agents of hospital-acquired pneumonia (7), but A. birgiae is rarely isolated. The genome was pyrosequenced with a 454 GS FLX titanium platform (Roche, Branford, CT) (11) using paired-end and shotgun techniques. A total of 512,586 reads were assembled with Newbler software v2.6 (Roche). Scaffolding was improved using Opera software v1.1 (4), combined with GapFiller v1.10 (3) and manual curation. The draft genome of A. birgiae 34632 consists of 65 contigs containing 5,302,490 bp and an estimated size, including gaps, of 5,325,467 bp. The G+C content of this genome is 60.58%, which is similar to that of the other completed genome of Afipia (Afipia sp. strain 1NLS2, with 61% G+C). Using BLASTN, Aragorn (10), and RNAmmer (6), the genome was shown to encode 53 RNA genes, including 3 rRNAs in a single operon and 50 tRNAs. However, considering the large size of the genome, the gaps between contigs could have included other RNA operons. Potential coding sequences were predicted using Prodigal software (5). Assignment of protein functions was performed by searching against GenBank, Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), and Pfam databases using BLASTP (1, 12, 14). A total of 5,160 genes were identified, representing a coding capacity of 4,598,637 bp (86.4% of the sequenced genome). Among these genes, 169 (3.2%) were assigned as putative proteins, 1,975 (38.3%) were assigned as hypothetical proteins, and 309 (6%) encode proteins of unknown function. Moreover, 5,124 genes matched at least one sequence in the COG database (13) with BLASTP default parameters.

Established Afipia-containing phagosomes possess neither early endosomal marker proteins [early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1), Rab5, transferrin receptor, trytophane aspartate containing coat protein (TACO)] nor late endosomal or lysosomal proteins [cathepsin D, \u03b2-glucuronidase, vacuolar proton-pumping ATPase, rab7, mannose-6-phosphate receptor, vesicle-associated membrane protein 8, lysosome-associated membrane proteins LAMP-1 and LAMP-2]. Those bacteria that will be found in a nonendosomal compartment enter the macrophage via an EEA1-negative compartment, which remains negative for LAMP-1. The smaller subpopulation of afipiae whose phagosomes will be part of the endocytic system enters into an EEA1-positive compartment, which also subsequently acquires LAMP-1. Killing of Afipia or opsonization with immune antibodies leads to a strong increase in the percentage of A. felis-containing phagosomes that interact with the endocytic system.

Most cases of Cat-Scratch Disease are, however, caused by closely related Bartonella henselae (3, 4). A. felis is a facultative intracellular bacterium and can survive or multiply in amoebas (5), macrophages, and some epithelial and endothelial cells in vitro (3, 6). This fits nicely with the observation that Afipia was found both in macrophages and capillary walls when lymph node biopsies from Cat-Scratch Disease patients were studied (2). Very little is known about the intracellular compartmentalization of A. felis-containing phagosomes (ACPs), except that only a minor percentage acquires preloaded lysosomal ferritin in macrophages when compared with phagosomes containing latex beads (3, 7). Maintenance of this unfused compartment depends on bacterial viability (7). Normal phagosomes, however, mature stepwise into phagolysosomes (8\u201313), and their maturation contributes to killing and degradation of ingested microorganisms and to presentation of their antigens to T cells (14). Inhibition of phagolysosome formation is a feature that A. felis shares with several other intracellular pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia trachomatis, or the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, with each of these occupying a different endocytic or, in some cases, nonendocytic niche (reviewed in refs. 10, 11, and 14).

It is characterized by edema of the optic disc, acute unilateral vision loss, dyschromatopsia, and macular stellate exudates (macular star), which develop after 1 or 2 weeks. Single episodes are the most common; however, recurrent attacks may occur. The first description of this disease was given by Theodor Leber in 1916, calling it stellate maculopathy. Later, Gass termed this disease neuroretinitis since he was able to prove by fluorescein angiography that the site of the leakage was the optic disc. The etiology of neuroretinitis often remains unrecognized in children and adolescents. The possible causes can be infectious, noninfectious, or idiopathic. Infectious agents can be classified into the following categories: viruses (mumps, varicella, rubella, measles, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, and hepatitis B), bacteria (Bartonella henselae, tuberculosis, and Salmonella), fungi (histoplasmosis and actinomycosis), nematodes (toxocara), spirochetes (Lyme disease, leptospirosis, and syphilis), and protozoa (toxoplasmosis). Noninfectious causes include malignancies, diabetes mellitus, and systemic or vascular diseases. Bartonella henselae is an aerobic Gram-negative bacterium whose natural reservoir is domestic cats. It belongs to the family of Bartonellaceae, Bartonella genus, and is best known as the cause of cat scratch disease (CSD) and the single most common cause of neuroretinitis. The epidemiology of Bartonella neuroretinitis is still unknown, but the global incidence of CSD in children was roughly 9.4\/100,000\/y. Bartonella henselae infection in humans can manifest as either a local or systemic infection. Fever with isolated lymphadenopathy or prolonged fever or hepatosplenic disease most commonly occurs with a history of feline exposure (typical CSD). In addition to neuroretinitis, other ocular presentations may occur, including Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome, vitritis, panuveitis, papillitis, vitreal detachment, macular hole, retinal white spots, retinal vasoproliferative lesions, and branch retinal artery and venous occlusions. The most common systemic forms are summarized in Table 1. Clinical Presentations of B. henselae Infection The clinical picture of Barotonella neuroretinitis usually begins with flu-like symptoms followed by acute vision loss. Unilateral vision loss is most common, although cases with bilateral vision loss have been described. Unilateral vision loss can also be associated with bilateral and asymptomatic disc edema in the other eye (Table 2).

The disease became known as \u201ctrench fever,\u201d and it was subsequently shown to be caused by the louse-borne bacterium now known as Bartonella quintana (1). Interestingly, at that time many soldiers affected by trench fever were also reported to have cardiac involvement, and a complication called \u201cdisordered action of the heart\u201d was described (2, 3). Diseases caused by bacteria in the current genus Bartonella, which once plagued the soldiers of World War I as trench fever, remained somewhat obscure until appearing as opportunistic infections in AIDS patients and homeless patients in urban areas in the early 1990s. Now characterized as reemerging, bacteria in the genus Bartonella are fastidious, Gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogens with a unique intraerythrocytic lifestyle. Bartonellae usually exist in two specific habitats: the gut of the obligately bloodsucking arthropod vector, where they are exposed to toxic concentrations of heme, and the bloodstream of the mammalian host with deprivation of access to heme and iron (4). The ability of these bacteria to be transmitted by bloodsucking arthropods facilitates survival and dispersion while avoiding the host immune system. Over the past 20 years, there has been a rapid increase in the number of Bartonella species, with 45 species now designated and with some species containing more than one subspecies (Table 1). New species and subspecies are constantly being proposed, as evidenced by the description of Bartonella vinsonii subsp. yucatanensis as a distinct new taxon (5). Additionally, Bartonella isolates and candidate species from a wide range of animal reservoirs have been described but not yet assigned new species designations and will undoubtedly further expand this growing genus of bacteria. Bartonellae are zoonotic bacteria transmitted from host to host by a diverse range of hematogenous arthropod vectors, including fleas, lice, ticks, and sandflies (6). The association of Bartonella species with new vectors such as sheep keds has been recently reported (7). Likewise, the association of Bartonella species with vertebrate host reservoirs, including cats, rodents, and humans, has long been established, but a steadily expanding range of new animal reservoirs has been reported, including marine mammals (8), terrestrial herbivores such as camels (9), and wild carnivores, including lions, bears, and foxes (10). The emergence of Bartonella in a wide range of hosts and environments and the association of these bacteria with disease are mirrored by a steady increase in the number of articles about Bartonella which have been published in the last 2 decades compared to earlier time periods (Fig. 1A). Currently designated Bartonella species, their hosts, and associated human disease (A) Number of publications on Bartonella in PubMed. Source: https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=bartonella. (B) Increase in reported Bartonella endocarditis cases. (Adapted from reference 177 with permission.) The role of Bartonella species in causing endocarditis was first reported in 1993 when B. quintana was identified in a patient with HIV infection (11). Soon thereafter, B. quintana was also isolated from several homeless patients with chronic alcoholism, some of whom were immunocompetent and had been diagnosed as having blood-culture-negative endocarditis (BCNE) (12,\u201314). In those cases, specialized isolation techniques were used to isolate B. quintana from the patient's blood and\/or PCR was used to confirm the etiology. That same year, Bartonella henselae was also shown to be responsible for a case of \u201cculture-negative\u201d endocarditis (15) and also in a second immunocompetent patient with endocarditis who owned a cat from which he most likely acquired the bacterium (16). Since that time, the number of cases of endocarditis and blood-culture-negative endocarditis that have been attributed to B. quintana and B. henselae has steadily increased (Fig. 1B). While these two species represent the vast majority of endocarditis cases attributed to Bartonella species, several other species, including B. alsatica (17), B. elizabethae (18), B. koehlerae (19), B. mayotimonensis (20), and B. vinsonii subsp. arupensis and berkhoffii (21,\u201323), have been associated with endocarditis in humans. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the human-pathogenic Bartonella species, focusing on the two species, B. henselae and B. quintana, which are most commonly associated with endocarditis."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can B. henselae cause?","id":"338-2-3-1","answers":[{"text":"BCNE","answer_start":361,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"The genus Bartonella is a rapidly expanding group of ubiquitous bacteria that are found in a diverse array of animal reservoirs.

In particular, B. henselae and B. quintana are frequent causes of BCNE that often go undiagnosed due to technical challenges in diagnosing infections caused by Bartonella species. Despite this challenge, the number of reported cases of Bartonella endocarditis is rapidly rising, and it represents a significant cause of infective endocarditis that remains understudied. The role of the TAAs (BadA and Vomps) and the T4SSs of Bartonella in the interaction of this bacterium with the vascular endothelium has been well studied, and they certainly play critical roles in the establishment of endocarditis. Furthermore, the ability of Bartonella to form biofilms is likely to be a crucial step in infection of heart valves and therefore in causing endocarditis. Additionally, the role that biofilms play in colonization and transmission in the arthropod vectors responsible for transmission of Bartonella species and persistence in both the natural and incidental hosts should also be considered."}]},{"title":"Cat Scratch Disease","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Bartonella henselae cause?","id":"338-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Cat scratch disease","answer_start":1,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Cat scratch disease (Cat scratch fever) causes a febrile illness with subacute regional lymphadenopathy.

He clearly was bacteremic, and he clearly had very high fever. The infection may have prompted a relapse of the vasculitis and the associated neurologic manifestations of his ill-defined rheumatologic syndrome. Occupational exposure seems to have been the likely means of acquiring the infection. There is anecdotal evidence of an abundance of voles in the locales of Montana in which this man worked. Ample opportunity probably existed for ectoparasitic exposure (ticks, fleas, and biting flies), but none was documented. In a few parts of the United States where rodent populations have been studied, Bartonella spp. have been found to be prevalent among mice and rats. Kosoy et al. (12) detected Bartonella in roughly 50% of the rodent populations in the southeastern United States, and Hofmeister et al. (9) detected a novel Bartonella species in the blood of mice in Minnesota and Wisconsin in the course of studies on the reservoirs of tick-borne pathogens. The new Bartonella species was detected incidentally, along with Borrelia burgdorferi and Babesia microti, when PCR primers targeting Ehrlichia spp. resulted in the amplification of Bartonella-like 16S ribosomal DNA segments. These findings, as well as those of this case, suggest that Bartonella spp. may occasionally be transmitted by ticks. Prior to the current understanding of the epidemiology of cat scratch disease, Lucey et al. (14) reported two cases of bacteremia due to B. henselae in immunocompetent men who had sustained tick bites prior to their illnesses. In addition to the well-documented role of fleas in the transmission of B. henselae (6) and the classic examples of louse-borne trench fever due to B. quintana and oroya fever due to Bartonella bacilliformis acquired from sand flies, it is possible that more than one arthropod vector of Bartonella-associated diseases exists. The Bartonella strains isolated from mice by Hofmeister et al. (9) were most closely related to Bartonella grahamii (2) on the basis of 16S rRNA sequence analysis and were most closely related to B. vinsonii subsp. vinsonii on the basis of citrate synthase gene sequence analysis. Our DNA relatedness studies indicated that mouse isolate 95 0726 14a from the study of Hofmeister et al. and human strain OK 94-513 fulfilled the molecular definition of a species as strains with 70% or more DNA relatedness (at an optimal reassociation criterion) and a D of 5% or less within related sequences (16). On the basis of this definition, the human and mouse strains were easily differentiated from all Bartonella species other than B. vinsonii. The relatedness to B. vinsonii subsp. vinsonii and B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii was at the species level, except that D was almost always 5 to 7%. These data left us with the choice of creating a new species for these strains or creating a third subspecies for them within B. vinsonii. We chose the second alternative because of the similarity of relatedness of the new strains to that previously seen within existing B. vinsonii subspecies (11). We therefore now describe Bartonella vinsonii subsp. arupensis subsp. nov.  Bartonella vinsonii subsp. arupensis (a.rup.en.\u2032sis. N.L. fem.adj. arupensis, from Associated and Regional University Pathologists, Inc., the laboratory where the type strain was initially characterized).

Due to its niche within erythrocytes and its slow replication time, Bartonella species evade identification by routine blood culture methods [2,3]. B. quintana is predominantly transmitted by body lice feces, entering the bloodstream through microabrasions of the skin [2]. While originally identified among soldiers in the trenches of World War I, B. quintana has emerged among urban populations experiencing homelessness, leading to the designation of \u201curban trench fever\u201d [4,5]. B. quintana is a major cause of culture-negative endocarditis and is associated with chronic bacteremia that may last many months [6]. B. quintana has recently been reported in rural Northern Canada. The first published rural Canadian case of B. quintana endocarditis was acquired in Northern Manitoba in 2014 in a remote Cree community, 500 kilometers from the community where this pediatric patient lived [7]. In 2020, 2 additional cases of B. quintana endocarditis were diagnosed in individuals from a different Oji-Cree community, 75 kilometers from the one presented here [8]. In 2021, a fourth case of B. quintana endocarditis was described in a patient from rural Northern Alberta [9]. Our case represents the fifth published case of B. quintana endocarditis in rural Northern Canada, the first pediatric case of B. quintana in Canada and the first pediatric case of B. quintana endocarditis acquired in a high-income country [10]. In 2019, a case of urban B. quintana endocarditis was described in a man experiencing homelessness in a Canadian city [11]. This case, along with a review of 12 other North American cases of B. quintana endocarditis, occurred outside the hypothesized \u201cEurope\u2013African gradient\u201d [11,12]. This concept describes a latitudinal gradient between areas of high B. quintana prevalence in Africa and low prevalence in Northern Europe [11,12]. The increasing number of B. quintana endocarditis cases in Northern Canada defy the \u201cEurope\u2013African gradient\u201d and suggest that this gradient may be an economic one, rather a latitudinal one: Northern populations experiencing poverty may demonstrate similar rates of B. quintana to Southern populations. Pediculosis was not described in any of the rural Canadian cases of B. quintana endocarditis. While B. quintana has been detected in alternate vectors such as cat fleas, most studies suggest that B. quintana is a specialist adapted to the louse vector and human host. [2,13\u201315] A nonhuman reservoir and nonlouse vectors remain possible, although undescribed in the Canadian context. Due to its predominant link with body lice ectoparasitosis, B. quintana transmission occurs where there is inadequate access to suitable housing and running water, whether that be in historic wartime Europe, urban homeless encampments, or disadvantaged communities of Northern Canada [4,5,7\u20139]. The patient described here was housed and had not spent significant time in an urban center. As many indigenous communities in Canada are plagued by a housing and running water crisis, we suggest that living in a remote community in Northern Canada is a risk factor for B. quintana [16]. This case highlights the need for active B. quintana case finding and elucidation of specific risk factors for B. quintana acquisition in the Canadian North. We hypothesize that B. quintana\u2019s endemicity in rural Northern Canada is linked to inadequate access to running water and neglected pediculosis in certain remote communities."}]},{"title":"Bartonella (Rochalimaea) quintana infections","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Bartonella quintana cause?","id":"339-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"trench fever","answer_start":72,"id":1},{"text":"fever and bacteremia, endocarditis, bacillary angiomatosis, and chronic lymphadenopathy","answer_start":312,"id":2},{"text":"trench fever and bacteremia","answer_start":714,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Bartonella (formerly Rochalimaea) quintana is the etiological agent of trench fever, a disease extensively reported during the World Wars.

Human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients and\/or homeless people are the most vulnerable to infection. Poverty and louse infestation were the main epidemiological factors associated with B. quintana infections during wartime. Although poverty and chronic alcoholism have been associated with modern cases of trench fever and bacteremia due to B. quintana in Europe and the United States, vectors for B. quintana have not been clearly identified and B. quintana has not been isolated from modern-day lice. Microscopic bacillary angiomatosis lesions are characterized by tumor-like capillary lobules, with proliferating endothelial cells. In vitro experiments have shown that B. quintana survives within endothelial cells and stimulates cell proliferation. These observations, together with the finding that lesions may regress when antibiotic therapy is administered, strongly suggest that B. quintana itself stimulates angiogenesis. Bartonella infections are characterized by a high frequency of relapses after brief courses of antibiotic therapy. It is to be noted that in vitro, although Bartonella species are highly susceptible to antibiotics, only the aminoglycosides have proved to be bactericidal.

The treatment was changed to doxycycline (200 mg daily) for 6 weeks and ceftriaxone (2 g daily). He became apyretic, and the valve was replaced after 15 days of treatment. On follow-up in April 2005, he was fine and apparently cured. He was reinterviewed retrospectively and revealed that he had been in charge of feeding rabbits in August 2004 and that he had butchered a rabbit in June 2004. Bartonella quintana subsp. Oklahoma, B. henselae subsp. Houston (ATCC 49882), B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffi (URBVAIE25), B. vinsonii subsp. arupensis (ATCC 700727), and B. alsatica (CIP 105477 T) strains were used for immunofluorescence and Western blot assays (6). The serum showed an immunoglobulin G titer of 1:800 for B. alsatica and an immunoglobulin G titer of 1:400 for the other Bartonella isolates as determined using an immunofluorescence assay. We performed Western blotting using Bartonella sp. antigens (6), and after adsorption, only B. alsatica antigens retained all antibodies. The cardiac valve and the blood samples were inoculated into human endothelial cells in a shell vial assay and onto Columbia 5% sheep blood agar plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere (8). Detection of a Bartonella sp. in the shell vial by immunofluorescence was positive after 2 months of culture, and identification was confirmed by PCR-based methods. DNA was extracted from blood and valve specimens as well as from inoculated cells by use of a QIAamp tissue kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The DNA was used as a template in two previously described PCR assays targeting a portion of the Bartonella internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (4, 8) and the ftsZ gene (10) and in a new Bartonella genus Lightcycler assay using primers and a TaqMan probe targeting the ITS gene (forward primer, 5\u2032-GGGGCCGTAGCTCAGCTG-3\u2032; reverse primer, 5\u2032-TGAATATATCTTCTCTTCACAATTTC-3\u2032; probe, 6-carboxyfluorescein-CGATCCCGTCCGGCTCCACCA-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine). All three PCR results for the cardiac valve and the cell culture were positive, and amplification products of the expected size were obtained from this extract; however, there were no positive results either from the blood sample or from any concurrently processed negative-control materials (one of every two specimens). The sequences obtained shared 100% similarity with the corresponding ITS (GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AF312506\",\"term_id\":\"15277585\"}}AF312506) and ftsZ fragment (GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AF467763\",\"term_id\":\"23506252\"}}AF467763) of B. alsatica. This strain of Bartonella had never been cultivated or amplified in this laboratory before this experiment, and the reference strain of B. alsatica (CIP 105477 T) was cultured only after this amplification for the retrospective serological analysis. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded valve tissue specimens were cut to 3 \u03bcm in thickness and stained with hematoxylin-eosin-saffron. Microscopic examination of valve tissue samples showed typical histological features related to infective endocarditis, with vegetations, inflammatory infiltrates, and destruction of the prosthetic valve tissues. Warthin-Starry staining revealed multitudes of bacillary organisms organized in clusters (Fig. \u200b(Fig.11). Resected valve with Bartonella alsatica infection showing darkly stained bacilli consistent with Bartonella infections. Numerous clusters of argyrophilic bacteria are present in the fibrin deposits (Warthin-Starry staining; original magnification, \u00d71,000). B. alsatica is a recently identified agent that causes bacteremia in healthy wild rabbits in Alsace, France (2, 5). In several cases, Bartonella spp. specifically adapted to rodents have been found in patients with blood-culture-negative endocarditis (BCNE) (8). In this report we identified B. alsatica in a patient for the first time, by culture, PCR, and serology. The bacteria of the genus Bartonella are relatively host specific and cause chronic bacteremia (7). Two species are the primary human bacteremic agents: B. bacilliformis in South America and B. quintana, mainly associated with body lice, worldwide. The Bartonella spp. associated with other mammals could be incidental pathogens for patients. The most common is B. henselae, which causes cat scratch disease. A Bartonella sp. also causes BCNE (8). Sporadic cases have been associated with other Bartonella spp. such as B. koehlerae (1), B. vinsonii subsp. berkoffii (9), B. vinsonii subsp. arupensis (4), and B. elizabethae (3). The current serologic method using an immunofluorescence assay does not distinguish among species, and only Western blot analysis and cross-adsorption allow serological identification of the species (6). PCR and culture are critical when a Bartonella species is identified for the first time as a human pathogen, as in this case. The current case reinforces the hypothesis that any Bartonella may cause BCNE in patients with valve lesions and exposure to an infected animal. B. alsatica should be added to the lists of human pathogens and of etiologic agents of BCNE."}]}]},{"species":"Bartonella koehlerae","docs":[{"title":"Bartonella koehlerae, a new cat-associated agent of culture-negative human endocarditis","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Bartonella koehlerae cause?","id":"341-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"culture-negative endocarditis","answer_start":87,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Bartonella koehlerae is reported for the first time to be a human pathogen that causes culture-negative endocarditis. It is also shown that this species, isolated twice before from domestic cats, can be recovered as well from a stray cat population in Israel. This work follows a recent report of the same case in which the causative agent was misidentified as B. henselae, based on serology and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis (A. Schattner, O. Zimhony, B. Avidor, and M. Gilad, Lancet 361:1786, 2003). B. koehlerae was identified in the valvular tissue of an endocarditis patient by DNA sequencing of the PCR products of two Bartonella genes: the genes for citrate synthase (gltA) and riboflavin synthase (ribC). The commonly used PCR-RFLP analysis of the TaqI-digested gltA PCR product did not distinguish between B. koehlerae and B. quintana or between B. elizabethae and B. clarridgeiae. PmlI digestion of the gltA amplification product failed to differentiate between B. quintana, B. clarridgeiae, and B. elizabethae. RFLP analysis of the heat shock protein (htrA) gene by TaqI digestion misidentified B. koehlerae as B. henselae. However, RFLP analysis of the ribC PCR product, digested with TaqI, was able to distinguish between the human endocarditis-associated Bartonella species tested, B. henselae, B. quintana, B. elizabethae, and B. koehlerae, as well as between the cat-associated Bartonella species, B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae. Given the expanding number of Bartonella species emerging as human pathogens, it is suggested that PCR-RFLP analysis for the diagnosis of Bartonella infections target several genes and be coupled with DNA sequencing to avoid species identification."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can B. koehlerae cause?","id":"341-1-2-1","answers":[{"text":"culture-negative endocarditis","answer_start":86,"id":1},{"text":"infective endocarditis","answer_start":968,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"This report demonstrates for the first time the direct involvement of B. koehlerae in culture-negative endocarditis, and this case of endocarditis is the first one in which this new cat-associated species has been recognized as a human pathogen. Isolation of B. koehlerae from the blood of domestic cats has been reported previously, but only twice. The first report was from the United States, in which in a study of the prevalence of Bartonella species in domestic cats, two isolates were recovered from two kittens living in the same household (10). The second report was a recent one from France, where an isolate was recovered from the blood of a domestic kitten suspected of causing cat scratch-like disease in its owner (31). Nevertheless, the presence of B. koehlerae infection in this patient was not confirmed either by PCR or by serology. We report here on the amplification and sequencing of B. koehlerae DNA from the aortic valve tissue of a patient with infective endocarditis, which strongly implicates this bacterium as the causative agent of this disease, as has been repeatedly demonstrated in other cases of human endocarditis caused by B. quintana and B. hense lae (8, 12, 15, 16, 32), as well as in a single case caused by B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii (32). The prevalence of B. koehlerae and its route of transmission are still to be determined. We report here for the first time the isolation of these bacteria from a stray cat population, suggesting that it is not confined only to domestic cats, as reported previously. The fact that our patient did not own a cat but often fed street cats in his backyard supports the assumption that a B. koehlerae-infected stray cat may have been the source of his infection (34). We have isolated B. koehlerae from only 1 (2%) of 48 cats. It is not clear, though, whether this low rate of recovery was due to a low prevalence of this species or its more fastidious nature compared with those of B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae, or both (10). Rolain et al. (30) recently reported on the detection of B. koehlerae DNA in 3 (3.7%) of 81 cat fleas, collected from various locations in France. In addition, a recent report showed that a persistent (78-day), asymptomatic, B. koehlerae bacteremia can be experimentally established in domestic cats following intradermal inoculation of B. koehlerae (36). In view of these findings, it is likely that B. koehlerae, similar to B. henselae, persistently infects cats and that the cat flea is most likely responsible for its transmission from cat to cat. The PCR-RFLP patterns of the TaqI-digested gltA PCR products of the B. koehlerae strains amplified from the aortic valve specimen (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1B)1B) and from the feline isolate (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3),3), although identical, differed from the PCR-RFLP pattern previously reported by Droz et al. (10). However, in contrast to the report of Droz et al. (10), our sequence data are consistent with the sequence of the B. koehlerae type strain published in the GenBank database (accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AF176091\",\"term_id\":\"5739488\"}}AF176091). Furthermore, Droz et al. (10) reported that the gltA PCR product of B. koehlerae consists of two amplicons of approximately 400 and 550 bp, respectively, whereas our gltA amplification resulted in a single amplicon of approximately 400 bp, which is the expected size of the B. koehlerae amplification product on the basis of the published DNA sequence. The reason for these discrepancies is not clear, but it may be derived from their use of gltA PCR primers specific for Rickettsia prowazekii, which, from our experience, may result in nonspecific amplification. Our study shows that the molecular biology-based diagnosis of Bartonella endocarditis by the PCR-RFLP-based approach may lead to an incorrect species identification. gltA analysis by TaqI digestion, which was historically shown to accurately discriminate between Bartonella species (4, 27), was not able to distinguish between B. koehlerae and B. quintana (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1B)1B) or between B. elizabethae and B. clarridgeiae (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1B)1B) in our study. Although digestion of the gltA PCR product with the PmlI restriction enzyme successfully discriminated between B. koehlerae and B. henselae and between B. koehlerae and B. quintana, it could not differentiate between B. clarridgeiae and B. elizabethae (Fig. \u200b(Fig.4A).4A). However, the recently described RFLP assay with TacI-digested ribC amplification products (17) was successful in discriminating between the endocarditis-associated Bartonella species tested (B. henselae, B. quintana, B. elizabethae, and B. koehlerae) as well as between the cat-associated Bartonella pathogens, B. henselae, B. clarridgeiae, and B. koehlerae. Nevertheless, the emergence of new Bartonella species as pathogens in humans and in nonhuman mammals calls for prudence. Since DNA sequencing is not commonly practiced in most clinical microbiology laboratories, we suggest the use of the multigene PCR-RFLP approach as a preliminary diagnostic step for patients with suspected Bartonella endocarditis, followed by DNA sequencing for accurate species identification."}]},{"title":"Hallucinations, sensory neuropathy, and peripheral visual deficits in a young woman infected with Bartonella koehlerae","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Bartonella koehlerae cause?","id":"341-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"aortic valve endocarditis","answer_start":7135,"id":1},{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":7318,"id":2},{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":11687,"id":3},{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":12465,"id":4}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"An 18-year-old female was sequentially examined by a neurologist, psychiatrist, neuro-ophthalmologist, and infectious disease physician because of a 4-year history of slowly progressive neurological and neurocognitive abnormalities. Biopsy-proven celiac disease was diagnosed in December 2004, following complaints of frequent stomach cramps. Despite dietary control of gastrointestinal symptoms, she developed intermittent joint pain, primarily involving the ankles. During 2005, the patient reported reduced tactile sensation in her hands and by 2007 frequent severe headaches, back pain, generalized muscle spasms, and an inability to extend her fingers due to stiffness in her proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. In 2008, she was referred to a neurologist for evaluation of depression, anxiety, mood swings, dizziness, auditory and visual hallucinations, and a progressive decrease in peripheral vision. No abnormalities were observed on a noncontrast magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain or an electroencephalogram. The hallucinations were initially infrequent; however, by fall 2008, the hallucinations became frequent, more intense, and at times were accompanied by 1- to 2-min dissociative episodes. The patient's psychiatrist addressed her anxiety with cognitive behavioral therapy and prescribed oxcarbazepine (300 mg twice daily) and quetiapine fumarate (300 mg in the evening), which reduced hallucination frequency to less than once daily. In January 2009, at the request of the patient's parents, we performed PCR on aseptically obtained EDTA-anticoagulated blood and serum, inoculated EDTA blood into Bartonella-Alphaproteobacteria growth medium (BAPGM), and tested serum for immunofluorescent antibodies using cell culture-grown Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii genotypes I, II, and III and Bartonella henselae antigens, as previously described (2, 5, 6, 11). At the time of her original testing, our research laboratory did not perform Bartonella koehlerae immunofluorescent-antibody (IFA) testing, and we had not yet developed a B. koehlerae-specific PCR assay. Therefore, her first samples were not seroreactive (IFA titer, \u22651:64) to any of the Bartonella sp. test antigens, and no amplicons were obtained with 16S-23S intergenic spacer (ITS) Bartonella genus primers from blood, serum, or the 7-day BAPGM enrichment blood culture (Table 1). However, a PCR amplicon was obtained from the 14-day BAPGM enrichment culture, suggesting Bartonella sp. growth following incubation for 14 days. Efforts to determine the Bartonella species by sequencing the amplicon were unsuccessful; therefore, serology and BAPGM enrichment blood cultures were repeated in March and May 2009. Repeat testing generated no additional serological or molecular evidence to support previous or current infection with a Bartonella sp. Serological, BAPGM enrichment blood culture, and PCR\/DNA sequencing test results for an 18-year-old woman with hallucinations and peripheral visual deficits In March 2009, the patient was referred to a neuro-ophthalmologist because of decreased peripheral vision. The ophthalmologic examination was normal, with 20\/20 visual acuity and no eye pain or redness. By formal perimetry, peripheral vision was reduced to the central 5 degrees bilaterally. The patient was advised to avoid driving a car and to repeat perimetry testing in a few weeks; however, the patient was noncompliant and was not reexamined until 20 months later. In June 2009, her infectious-disease clinician initiated an 8-week course of doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) and rifampin (300 mg twice daily), due to ongoing symptoms and the January 2009 Bartonella genus PCR result in the 14-day enrichment culture. After starting antibiotics and while continuing cognitive behavioral therapy, oxcarbazepine, and quetiapine fumarate, the patient reported a further decrease (from daily to one episode every 2 weeks) in hallucination frequency. When the patient was reexamined at the conclusion of the antibiotic course, treatment duration was extended for an additional 6 weeks due to the patient's maladherence. Following completion of antibiotics, the patient regained the ability to extend her fingers and described improved tactile sensation. Her psychiatrist documented a further improvement, with her hallucinations changing from disturbing visual and auditory sensations, to nondisturbing episodes of hearing her name called, to simply a \u201cwhite noise.\u201d At the patient's request, the dose of oxcarbazepine was reduced. By November 2009, the Intracellular Pathogens Research Laboratory (IPRL) had developed a B. koehlerae immunofluorescent-antibody assay, using an isolate derived from a sick cat (2, 5). Retrospective IFA testing of frozen serum samples (January, March, and May 2009) and prospective testing of serum obtained in November 2009 and February and June 2010 consistently detected B. koehlerae antibodies (Table 1). During the same time period, B. koehlerae species-specific 16S-23S ITS PCR primers repeatedly amplified organism-specific DNA sequences from the blood or BAPGM enrichment cultures. Specifically, amplification of the B. koehlerae ITS region was performed using oligonucleotides Bkoehl-1s (5\u2032 CTT CTA AAA TAT CGC TTC TAA AAA TTG GCA TGC 3\u2032) and Bkoehl1125as (5\u2032 GCC TTT TTT GGT GAC AAG CAC TTT TCT TAA G 3\u2032) as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Amplification was performed in a 25-\u03bcl final volume reaction mixture containing 12.5 \u03bcl of Tak-Ex Premix (Fisher Scientific), 0.1 \u03bcl of 100 \u03bcM each forward and reverse primer (IDT DNA Technology), 7.3 \u03bcl of molecular-grade water, and 5 \u03bcl of DNA from each sample tested. With repeated PCR documentation of B. koehlerae bacteremia, the patient was treated with rifampin (300 mg twice daily) and azithromycin (250 mg\/day) for an additional 4 months. Following this treatment regimen, her hallucinations stopped completely, and normal peripheral vision was confirmed by visual field perimetry in November 2010. The quetiapine fumarate dosage was gradually decreased, and hallucinations and dissociative episodes have not returned. B. koehlerae antibodies were not detected in August and September 2010 and January and March 2011 (Table 1). With the exception of a single 7-day BAPGM enrichment culture PCR result (January 2011), for which the amplicon could not be successfully sequenced, Bartonella sp. DNA was not amplified from blood, serum, or enrichment blood cultures (n = 31 independent PCRs) following the 4-month treatment regimen. During the 9-month posttreatment follow-up period, the patient has experienced no hallucinations, peripheral vision has remained normal, and tactile sensation has improved substantially. Family members reported that the patient was much improved and had returned to her preinfection baseline, both neurologically and psychiatrically.  Bartonella koehlerae was initially characterized from blood culture isolates obtained from two flea-infested healthy cats from northern California in the early 1990s (7, 8). In 2004, the bacterium was first reported as a human pathogen in a patient from Israel with aortic valve endocarditis (1). Investigators subsequently isolated B. koehlerae from flea-infested (Ctenocephalides felis) stray cats in Israel (1). In 2010, we reported B. koehlerae bacteremia in eight patients with variable symptoms (5). The diagnostic evaluation of the patient in this case report benefitted from development of a B. koehlerae serological and, subsequently, species-specific PCR assay (5). When first tested using Bartonella genus ITS primers in January 2009, only the 14-day BAPGM enrichment blood culture was PCR positive. As multiple attempts to sequence this amplicon were not successful, Bartonella species bacteremia was suspected but not confirmed. Subsequent serological and Bartonella genus ITS PCR (genus primers) testing of BAPGM enrichment blood cultures spanning a 17-month time period was consistently negative, whereas retrospective and prospective IFA testing consistently identified B. koehlerae antibodies, until after the third course of antibiotics, when the patient also became seronegative. Of serodiagnostic importance, there was no cross-reactivity to B. henselae or B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii antigens. Similarly, B. koehlerae DNA was repeatedly amplified and sequenced using species-specific primers until after the third antibiotic course. Assuming that the patient was not reexposed, treatment with doxycycline and rifampin for 14 weeks in 2009 did not eliminate B. koehlerae bacteremia. Lack of patient compliance may have contributed to the initial treatment failure but was not a factor during administration of the subsequent treatment regimens. Following the third course of antibiotics, the patient experienced clinical resolution of symptoms and a decrease in B. koehlerae antibody titers to a seronegative status, and whole-blood, serum, and BAPGM cultures were PCR negative, with one exception (5 January 2011). It is possible that her infection may not have been eliminated or that the patient was reinfected by animal or arthropod contact. Her pet cat and dog were seronegative and BAPGM PCR negative. Follow-up serological and BAPGM enrichment culture testing in March 2011 was negative. In this study, all patient samples were processed in a biosafety cabinet with HEPA filtration, located in a limited access laboratory. To avoid DNA carryover, PCR sample preparation, DNA extraction, and PCR amplification and analysis were performed in three separate rooms with a unidirectional work flow. For PCR, Bartonella sp. negative controls were prepared using 5 \u03bcl of DNA from the blood of a healthy dog. As newly designed B. koehlerae species-specific PCR primers were used in this study, we purposely did not use a B. koehlerae positive control. To assess for potential contamination during processing of enrichment blood cultures, an uninoculated BAPGM culture flask was processed simultaneously and in an identical manner with each batch of patient blood and serum samples tested. For all components of the BAPGM blood culture enrichment platform (PCR from blood, serum, enrichment cultures, and subcultures), PCR negative controls remained negative throughout the course of the study. Based upon the results of this study, the B. koehlerae ITS species-specific primers were more sensitive than the Bartonella genus ITS primers. In order to successfully amplify Bartonella sp. DNA from as many patient samples as possible, the antisense primer used in the genus PCR was designed to amplify pathogenically relevant species, while avoiding nonspecific amplification of Mesorhizobium DNA (9). Thus, the design of this primer resulted in greater specificity but decreased sensitivity. The B. koehlerae species-specific antisense primer was designed to amplify only B. koehlerae, thus sensitivity was improved. As illustrated in the table, direct DNA extraction from blood and serum was repeatedly negative, whereas PCR from 7- or 14-day BAPGM enrichment cultures contained adequate bacterial numbers (ITS targets) to allow for successful amplification and DNA sequencing. Despite growth in the liquid-enrichment culture flasks, we were never able to obtain a B. koehlerae subculture isolate from this patient, which remains a technical problem with this genus of highly fastidious bacteria. Interestingly, there was no cross-reactivity to antigens of other Bartonella sp. (B. henselae) or subspecies (B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii genotypes I, II, and III). Fatigue, insomnia, joint pain, headache, memory loss, and muscle pain were among frequent symptoms in eight patients with B. koehlerae bacteremia, of which four patients reported decreased tactile sensation or numbness and three reported blurred vision (5). B. koehlerae antibodies were not detected in 30 healthy individuals, who were concurrently PCR negative for all components of the BAPGM platform (5). Following suspected needlestick transmission of Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii, a veterinarian reported frequent headaches, fatigue, and intermittent paresthesias in the left arm in focal, nondermatomal areas (11). Bartonella henselae infection was reported in a patient with distal axonal sensomotor polyneuropathy and Raynaud's phenomenon (13). Brachial plexus neuropathy was diagnosed in three patients with neuralgic amyotrophy (12, 13). Prospective studies are needed to evaluate B. koehlerae bacteremia in patients with unexplained fatigue, joint pain, sensory neuropathies, visual deficits, and hallucinations. With the advent of B. henselae serology, PCR, and improved enrichment culture techniques, case studies are suggesting an important and expanding role for Bartonella sp. infection in patients with memory loss, expressive aphasia, word substitution errors, and impaired repetition (3, 4, 10). In our patient, there was a decrease in hallucination frequency following the initial course of antibiotics and total resolution of the hallucinations and visual field deficits following the third course of antibiotics while on a stable dose of antipsychotic medication. We conclude that this constellation of symptoms should raise the index of clinical suspicion for Bartonella infection."}]}]},{"species":"Bartonella bacilliformis","docs":[{"title":"Bartonella henselae, B. quintana, and B. bacilliformis: historical pathogens of emerging significance","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Bartonella bacilliformis cause?","id":"342-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Carrion's disease","answer_start":442,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Bartonella species were virtually unrecognized as modern pathogens of humans until the last decade.

The patient had a cat and a dog in London but had spent the previous month in Portugal, where he had also had contact with a pig, a cow, and a cockerel. On admission he was afebrile. His peripheral white blood cell count was 10.4, hemoglobin was 13.6, C-reactive protein was 46, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 39. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a dilated left ventricle and a bicuspid aortic valve with thickened cusps and significant regurgitation. Three set of blood cultures collected on admission were negative, but antibodies reactive to chlamydial antigens were detected by immunofluorescence study. No antibiotic treatment was given. Eighteen days later, the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement with a homograft during which he was given vancomycin and gentamicin as peri-operative prophylaxis. A diagnosis of endocarditis was not considered, but the valve had to be changed for hemodynamic reasons. A large (7-mm) vegetation was apparent on the excised valve, but no microorganism could be microscopically observed after Gimenez staining and routine and cell cultures remained sterile. The genus Bartonella comprises 14 species that cause asymptomatic bacteremia in various mammals including humans. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison, the Bartonella genus has been classified in the alpha subgroup of the Proteobacteria. Bartonella quintana and Bartonella bacilliformis infect humans. B. bacilliformis has long been recognized as the agent of Carrion's disease, and B. quintana was described as the agent of trench fever over 70 years ago. Far more recently, Bartonella henselae has been identified as the agent of cat scratch disease and peliosis hepatitis, and along with a reemerging B. quintana, has also been implicated in bacillary angiomatosis. Bartonella clarridgeiae has now been demonstrated as an agent of cat scratch disease (5). Two of these species, B. henselae and B. quintana, together with the fifth pathogen, Bartonella elizabethae, have been reported to cause endocarditis in humans (8). We herein implicate a sixth Bartonella species, B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii, in human disease. We used molecular methods to detect its presence in an infected bicuspid aortic valve of a patient with endocarditis. Anti-Bartonella antibodies were detected in serum by immunofluorescence as previously described (7) at the following titers: B. henselae (200), B. quintana (400), and B. vinsonii subsp. vinsonii (100). Valvular material was used as template in a PCR. Genomic DNA was extracted using Qiagen columns (QIAamp tissue kit; QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). PCR was designed to specifically amplify a fragment of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region of Bartonella species (ITS1) using primers QHVE1 and QHVE3 (10). An amplification product was obtained, but when the nucleotide base sequence of this product was determined and compared to Bartonella ITS sequences deposited in GenBank, it was found not to match any of them. Thus, to identify the newly detected organism, valvular material was also incorporated as a template in a Bartonella-specific PCR targeting a fragment of the citrate synthase gene (gltA) and in a PCR targeting a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene as previously described (1). The success of the amplifications was confirmed under UV light following ethidium bromide staining. Sequencing reactions were performed using a DNA sequencing kit (dRhodamine Terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction with Amplitaq Polymerase FS) (PE Applied Biosystem, Warrington, United Kingdom) as described by the manufacturer. Sequence products were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels, and electrophoresis was performed with the ABI PRISM 377 DNA Sequencer (Perkin Elmer). The sequences of both strands were determined twice. A total of 929 bp and 1,458 bp were sequenced for the citrate synthase gene and 16S rDNA, respectively. Comparison with sequences deposited in GenBank showed >99.7% homology with 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and 100% homology with a 338-bp gltA fragment of B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii. This bacterium was never cultivated and PCR amplified in our laboratory, so PCR contamination was impossible. As previously described for other Bartonella spp., ITS1 contained the genes encoding isoleucine- and alanine-accepting tRNAs. The unique insertion sequence of 16S rRNA reported for isolate 93-CO1 (2) was also found in the 16S DNA sequence of the studied Bartonella. For Bartonella species, Birtles and Raoult were the first to show that the gltA-derived phylogeny was more useful than the phylogeny derived from 16S rDNA sequence comparison (1). This observation was confirmed in previously published articles (2, 6), as B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii and B. vinsonii subsp. vinsonii were not included in a monophyletic group when phylogenetic analysis was inferred from 16S rDNA sequences. However, when citrate synthase gene sequences were compared, the two subspecies of B. vinsonii formed a group (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1).1).  Phylogenetic analysis of bacteria included in the genus Bartonella inferred from the citrate synthase gene (gltA) sequence comparison. C1-phy, C4-phy, R-phy1, and R-phy2 were isolated from blood samples from Phyllotis sp. in Peru, C5-rat and C7-rat were isolated from blood samples from Rattus sp. in Peru, N40 was isolated from blood samples from Apodemus sylvaticus in the United Kingdom (1). The evolutionary distance values were determined by the method of Kimura, and the tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method. The numbers at the nodes are the proportions of 100 bootstrap resamplings that support the topology shown. The patient had no clinical features of endocarditis and was afebrile. The aortic vegetation found at surgery had not been detected on transthoracic echocardiography. Although the serum antibody titers against Bartonella were significant, the levels were markedly lower than those usually encountered in cases of Bartonella endocarditis (1:1,600 or more) (9). According to the Duke criteria for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, this case was diagnosed as a possible endocarditis (4) before the histological examination of the valve. We failed to culture Bartonella from the excised valve, possibly because of prophylactic antibiotics prescribed just before surgery, so PCR product sequencing was the only approach that could be used in identifying the agent of infection. Previously, Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii had been isolated only from blood samples from a healthy dog and a dog suffering valvular endocarditis (2, 6). Our patient had contact with many animals, including a dog, which may have been the source of his infection, but none of these animals were investigated. Another Bartonella species, B. elizabethae, was isolated only once from a patient with endocarditis, and no exposure to pets or other animals was noted (3). Nevertheless, this bacteria is phylogenetically closely related to other Bartonella spp. isolated from rodents. For the majority of Bartonella species, a nonhuman mammalian reservoir exists, with infections being transmitted among hosts by arthropods (8). Human infections by these species are therefore accidental. However, the exceptional species B. quintana and B. bacilliformis appear to use humans as their primary host (8).

B. grahamii (formerly known as Grahamella) has been found in small rodents, but was, to our knowledge, never implicated in human infections (3, 11). Ocular involvement in the course of Bartonella infections is being recognized with increasing frequency, with B. henselae being the most frequently encountered species (9, 18). In the past, ophthalmological manifestations such as Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome, papillitis, multifocal chorioretinitis, and, mainly, neuroretinitis have been associated with cat-scratch disease (CSD), especially in children and young adults (5, 18). In addition, various reports have described intraocular inflammation associated with highly positive antibody titers against B. henselae in patients who lacked the systemic symptoms and signs typical of generalized CSD (12, 24). The exact pathogenesis of ocular involvement in bartonellosis is still obscure. Although the presence of B. henselae DNA has been described in the retina of an AIDS patient, it is not known whether in immunocompetent patients the Bartonella species directly cause intraocular infection or whether ocular involvement represents a secondary (auto)immune reaction (29). We describe a patient with neuroretinitis and high levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) against B. henselae in serum. PCR and sequence analysis of the PCR product identified the presence of B. grahamii DNA in the patient's eye."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where does B. grahamii normally exist?","id":"345-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"rodents in North America and Europe","answer_start":1370,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"In the study described in this report we demonstrated the presence of B. grahamii DNA in the eye of an HIV-negative patient with neuroretinitis, which indicates the direct involvement of Bartonella species in neuroretinitis and further documents the possibility of B. grahamii infection in humans. Uveitis, an intraocular inflammatory disease, is an important cause of severe visual impairment and blindness and causes significant morbidity in the economically active young adult population (25). Infectious processes play an important role in the pathogenesis of uveitis; specifically, herpesviruses and T. gondii are common causative agents in immunocompetent as well as in immunocompromised patients (8). The recognition of an infectious etiology of uveitis is important because of the consequences of the treatment; while immunosuppressive medication is essential for the majority of patients with noninfectious uveitis, this treatment modality may induce a fulminant course of infection without specific antimicrobial treatment (21). The recently achieved ability to detect microbial DNA has led to the recognition of various infectious agents as causes of intraocular inflammatory disease (7, 8). The route of B. grahamii infection in our patient is unclear. Various animals have been recognized as reservoirs for Bartonella species. B. grahamii was isolated from rodents in North America and Europe (3, 11). Domestic cats are a major reservoir for B. henselae, and a recently described subspecies, B. clarridgeiae, was also found in cats (13, 14). B. vinsonii has been cultured from the blood of a dog with endocarditis (4). Furthermore, studies suggested that not only fleas but also the human body louse, the sand fly, and ticks are possible vectors in the transmission of Bartonella species (16). Our patient described here owned a dog but had a negative history of cat ownership or cat scratches and had never been bitten or been in contact with small rodents. The existence of nonfeline infectious sources may explain the occurrence of ocular bartonellosis in the absence of previous contact with cats. In previous studies, ocular bartonellosis was mainly associated with B. henselae infections; however, this association was predominantly based solely on serological grounds (9, 12, 18). The present case suggests that ocular bartonellosis might also be caused by other Bartonella species, and therefore, ocular bartonellosis may also be present in patients lacking the systemic symptoms of CSD. The presence of IgG against B. henselae in the serum of our patient, as determined by EIA, is probably due to cross-reactivity between B. henselae and B. grahamii. Cross-reactivity between different Bartonella species has been described earlier (28). The diagnosis of human bartonellosis may be extremely troublesome, since the typical clinical features are not always present and the interpretation of the results of serological tests is difficult, as cross-reactivity between different Bartonella species has been observed (2, 28). Therefore, the diagnosis of bartonellosis should preferably rely on the detection of the infectious agent or the DNA of the infectious agent in the affected tissue. As patients with intraocular inflammation do not have tissues that are easily available for biopsy, diagnostic vitrectomy and retinal biopsy are recommended for patients with severe cases that threaten visual acuity (29). However, these surgical procedures are invasive and have considerable complication rates (27). Analysis of aqueous humor collected by anterior chamber tap, which was reported to be a safe diagnostic procedure for patients with uveitis, had diagnostic value even for patients with inflammatory lesions located in the posterior segment of the eye, such as the lesions associated with toxoplasmosis (7, 8, 26). In the previous studies, PCR analysis of intraocular fluids was specifically recommended for patients with early infections (and for immunosuppressed patients), since PCR positivity was mainly found for samples collected within 2 weeks after the onset of the disease (7, 8). The Bartonella PCR is usually performed with pus aspirates and lymph nodes from patients in the acute stages of the disease (1). A study of CSD encephalitis also showed that a PCR for detection of B. henselae in CSF was predominantly positive early in the course of the disease (23). In our patient, 1 year after the onset of the disease, B. grahamii DNA was present in the eye. The pathogenesis of intraocular inflammatory disease in patients with bartonellosis is not clear. The direct involvement of B. henselae in uveitis was supported by the detection of B. henselae DNA in a retinal lesion of an AIDS patient. In immunocompetent patients, ocular disease usually develops after systemic involvement has subsided, suggesting that ocular involvement represents a late complication of the disease (9, 18). However, this assumption cannot be confirmed by previous studies, because serology was performed mainly by IFA and no specific IgM titers were determined for these patients (6, 9, 19, 30). The late manifestation of ocular involvement might be explained by the persistence of bacteria in the eye, which is shielded from the peripheral circulation by the blood-ocular barrier. This presumably occurred in our patient. An alternative hypothesis for the development of uveitis in a late stage of systemic bartonellosis may be that the bacteria have an indirect role, in that they induce a late (auto)immune reaction. The presence of B. grahamii DNA in our patient indicates that the direct microbial involvement may occur in HIV-negative patients. The late onset of intraocular inflammation in patients with systemic infections is a well-known phenomenon in uveitic disease; it is characteristic for herpetic retinopathies and toxoplasmic retinitis (25). In patients with bacterial infections such as syphilis, tuberculosis, leptospirosis, and borreliosis, the late involvement also occurs and is usually associated with the presence of bacteria or bacterial DNA in the eye (10, 15, 17, 22). We demonstrated B. grahamii DNA in the intraocular fluids of a patient with neuroretinitis who was subsequently treated and reacted well to antibiotic therapy and who would otherwise be treated with immunosuppressive medication. Therefore, we would include bartonellosis in the differential diagnosis of patients with intraocular inflammatory disease, especially in those patients with neuroretinitis. Depending on the clinical manifestations and outcomes of laboratory examinations, we recommend that intraocular fluids be tested for infectious agents before initiating immunosuppressive treatment as a result of the symptomatology, especially in those patients with an unexplained cause of intraocular inflammation and clinical features suggesting an infectious disease. Future studies are needed to establish the involvement of different Bartonella species in human ocular disease."}]}]},{"species":"Bartonella mayotimonensis","docs":[{"title":"Candidatus Bartonella mayotimonensis and endocarditis","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Bartonella mayotimonensis is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"346-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-negative","answer_start":42,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Bartonella mayotimonensis cause?","id":"346-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"culture-negative infective endocarditis","answer_start":91,"id":1},{"text":"culture-negative endocarditis","answer_start":346,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Bartonella species are small, fastidious, gram-negative, intracellular bacteria that cause culture-negative infective endocarditis.

Different Bartonella species have been isolated from a variety of mammals, and each species is highly adapted to its reservoir host (11,12). The domestic cat is the primary mammalian reservoir for B. henselae (13). Other Bartonella species have been found in mammalian hosts, including rats (B. elizabethae), dogs and coyotes (B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii), cats (B. koehlerae), humans (B. bacilliformis and B. quintana), moles (B. talpae), voles (B. vinsonii subsp. vinsonii), cows (B. bovis [weissii]), deer (B. schoenbuchensis), and rabbits (B. alsatica) (3\u20136,12,14,15).

Additional investigations are needed to determine the reservoir(s) and vector(s) for this novel bacterium. The immunofluorescent assay, the current serologic method for diagnosis of Bartonella infection, does not distinguish among Bartonella species. Only Western blot analysis and cross-adsorption enable serologic identification of species. PCR and culture are critical when a Bartonella species is identified for the first time as a human pathogen. Newly encountered Bartonella strains should be considered a new species if a 327-bp gltA fragment shares <96.0% sequence similarity with those of validated species, and if an 825-bp rpoB fragment shares <95.4% sequence similarity with those of validated species as reported in the current case (8).

This bacterium was isolated from the stool of a healthy Senegalese patient as part of a \u201cculturomics\u201d study aiming at cultivating all species in human feces, individually. Bacterial species definition is a matter of debate. This is notably due to the high cost, poor reproducibility and inter-laboratory comparability of the \u201cgold standard\u201d of DNA-DNA hybridization and G+C content determination [1]. In contrast, the development of PCR and sequencing methods, both of which are now widely available and cost-effective, has profoundly changed the way of classifying prokaryotes. Using 16S rRNA sequences with internationally-agreed upon cutoff values, despite variations among taxa, enabled the taxonomic classification or reclassification of hundreds of taxa [2]. More recently, high throughput genome sequencing and mass spectrometric analyses of bacteria have given unprecedented access to a wealth of genetic and proteomic information [3]. As a consequence, we propose to use a polyphasic approach [4] to describe new bacterial taxa that includes their genome sequence, MALDI-TOF spectrum and major phenotypic characteristics (habitat, Gram staining, culture and metabolic characteristics, and when applicable, pathogenicity). Here we present a summary classification and a set of features for A. senegalensis sp. nov. strain JC50 together with the description of the complete genomic sequencing and annotation. These characteristics support the creation of the A. senegalensis species. The genus Alistipes (Rautio et al. 2003) was created in 2003 [5] and is composed of strictly anaerobic Gram-negative rods that resemble the Bacteroides fragilis group in that most species are bile-resistant and indole-positive; however, they are only weakly saccharolytic and most species produce light brown pigment only on laked rabbit blood agar [6]. The genus Alistipes contains five species namely A. finegoldii, A. putredinis [5], A. indistinctus [7], A. onderdonkii and A. shahii [8]. The natural habitat of the genus Alistipes is unknown but most of the species have mostly been isolated from blood samples, appendiceal tissue samples, perirectal and brain abscess material [9,10]. Predisposing factors to Alistipes sp. bacteremia include malignant neoplasms, recent gastrointestinal or obstetric-gynecologic surgery, intestinal obstruction, and use of cytotoxic agents or corticosteroids [9]. A 16S rRNA phylogenetic analysis revealed that A. senegalensis is closely related to A. shahii. To the best of our knowledge, our report is the first to report the isolation of Alistipes sp. from the normal fecal flora. A stool sample was collected from a healthy 16-year-old male Senegalese volunteer patient living in Dielmo (rural villages in the Guinean-Sudanian zone in Senegal), who was included in a research protocol. The patient gave an informed and signed consent, and the agreement of the National Ethics Committee of Senegal and the local ethics committee of the IFR48 (Marseille, France) (agreement 09-022), were obtained. The fecal specimen was preserved at -80\u00b0C after collection and sent to Marseille. Strain JC50 (Table 1) was isolated in March 2011 by anaerobic cultivation on Schaedler agar with kanamycin and vancomycin (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). Evidence codes - IDA: Inferred from Direct Assay; TAS: Traceable Author Statement (i.e., a direct report exists in the literature); NAS: Non-traceable Author Statement (i.e., not directly observed for the living, isolated sample, but based on a generally accepted property for the species, or anecdotal evidence). These evidence codes are from the Gene Ontology project [18]. If the evidence is IDA, then the property was directly observed for a live isolate by one of the authors or an expert mentioned in the acknowledgements. The strain exhibited 97.0%, 16S rRNA nucleotide sequence similarity with A. shahii, the phylogenetically-closest validly published Alistipes species.(Figure 1). Although the level of sequence similarity of the 16S rRNA gene sequence is not uniform across taxa, this value was lower than the 98.7% 16S rRNA gene sequence threshold recommended by Stackebrandt and Ebers to delineate a new species without carrying out DNA-DNA hybridization [19].

The tree was inferred from the comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequence.

Numbers at the nodes are bootstrap values obtained by repeating 500 times the analysis to generate a majority consensus tree. Bacteroides splanchnicus was used as an outgroup. The scale bar represents a 2% nucleotide sequence divergence. Different growth temperatures (25, 30, 37, 45\u00b0C) were tested; no growth occurred at 25\u00b0C and 45\u00b0C, growth occurred between 30 and 37\u00b0C, and optimal growth was observed at 37\u00b0C. Colonies were 0.2 to 0.3 mm in diameter on blood-enriched Columbia agar and Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar. Growth of the strain was tested under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions using GENbag anaer and GENbag microaer systems, respectively (BioM\u00e9rieux), and in the presence of air, with or without 5% CO2 and in aerobic conditions. The optimal growth of the strain was obtained anaerobically, with weak growth being observed under microaerophilic conditions, and no growth observed under aerobic conditions. Gram staining showed Gram negative bacilli. A motility test was negative. Cells grown on agar are Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria (Figure 2) and have a mean diameter of 0.56 \u00b5m (Figure 3) by electron microscopy.

Strain JC50 exhibited a catalase activity but no oxidase activity. Using API Rapid ID 32A, a positive reaction was obtained for mannose fermentation, proline arylimidase, leucyl glycine arylamidase, alanine arylamidase. A weak reaction was obtained for indole production, \u03b1-galactosidase, \u03b2-galactosidase, \u03b2-glucuronidase, arginine arlyamidase and glycine arylamidase. A. senegalensis is susceptible to penicillin G, imipeneme, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin but resistant to metronidazole and vancomycin. Matrix-assisted laser-desorption\/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS protein analysis was carried out as previously described [20]. Briefly, a pipette tip was used to pick one isolated bacterial colony from a culture agar plate, and spread as a thin film on an MTP 384 MALDI-TOF target plate (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). Four distinct deposits were done for strain JC50 from four isolated colonies. Each smear was overlaid with 2\u00b5L of matrix solution (saturated solution of alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) in 50% acetonitrile, 2.5% tri-fluoracetic acid, and allowed to dry for five minutes. Measurements were performed with a Microflex spectrometer (Bruker). Spectra were recorded in the positive linear mode for the mass range of 2,000 to 20,000 Da (parameter settings: ion source 1 (ISI), 20kV; IS2, 18.5 kV; lens, 7 kV). A spectrum was obtained after 675 shots at a variable laser power. The time of acquisition was between 30 seconds and 1 minute per spot. The four JC50 spectra were imported into the MALDI Bio Typer software (version 2.0, Bruker) and analyzed by standard pattern matching (with default parameter settings) against the main spectra of 2,843 bacteria, including spectra from three validly published Alistipes species used as reference data, in the Bio Typer database. The method of identification included the m\/z from 3,000 to 15,000 Da. For every spectrum, 100 peaks at most were taken into account and compared with the spectra in database. A score enabled the presumptive identification, or discrimination, from the tested species: a score \u2265 2 with a validated species enabled the identification at the species level; a score \u2265 1.7 but < 2 enabled the identification at the genus level; and a score < 1.7 did not enable any identification. Spectra were compared with the Bruker database that contained spectra from the three validated Alistipes species. No significant score was obtained, thus suggesting that our isolate was not a member of a known species. We incremented our database with the spectrum from strain JC50 (Figure 4).

It\u2019s commonly believed that the major virulence factors of Aeromonas species are haemolysins including enterotoxins, invasins, aerolysin, adhesins, proteases, phospholipase and lipase [4, 6]. Aeromonas sobria bacteremia is reported to have the highest mortality rate in this genus (Aeromonas sobria - 56%, Aeromonas hydrophyila - 33%, Aeromonas cavies - 17%) [7]. Aeromonas sobria may act as opportunistic pathogen that can cause bacteremia, intestinal and other extraintestinal infection, and can be isolated from sea water, soil, fish and many other food. Such infections occurred predominantly in patients with chronic hepatic disease, gastroenteritis, malignancy and immunocompromised status [4]. Although gastroenteritis is the most common infection of Aeromonas species, peritonitis caused by Aeromonas species are not uncommon, especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis [8\u201310]. However, peritonitis episodes due to Aeromonas species have seldom been reported in PD patients [11\u201322] (Table 1). The most frequently isolated specie was A. hydrophila (10;71.4%), while A. sobria was reported owning higher virulence (1;7.1%). The pathogenic mechanism of Aeromonas peritonitis in patients undergoing PD could be associated with direct exposure to contaminated water. From the literature review (Table \u200b(Table1),1), we found that two of the cases may be possibility of water-related infection, however, such infection has rarely been proven. Another possible mechanism is transmural migration from the gastrointestinal tract to the blood. The outcomes of PD-related peritonitis caused by Aeromonas species are generally good; however, recurrent peritonitis can occur (21.4%). The reason of recurrence may be biofilm formation on the surfaces of catheter. Recently, Joana et al. [23] found that no major differences on microbial density of the catheter cultures were observed between the catheters removed due to infectious and non-infectious causes. However, microbial yields were higher on the cuffs of catheters removed due to infection, which indicated that microbial biofilm is universal in PD catheters with the subclinical menace. Cuffs colonization may significantly contribute to infection. In this sense, it would not be prudent to prophylactically remove the PD catheter in PD-related peritonitis patients. Cases of PD-related Peritonitis Caused by Aeromonas Species Aeromonas peritonitis has an abrupt onset in most patients. In this case, the patient presented fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and cloudy peritoneal effluent several hours after eating stinky tofu. Stinky tofu, a kind of traditional Chinese food, is usually considered unhygienic. The tofu have to be placed in water for a long time to increase the unique smell. Human body may get infected after eating stinky tofu contaminated by Aeromonas sobria. Aeromonas can produce enterotoxin and hemolysin, causing gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. Then the bacterial translocation plays a important role in the pathogenesis of PD-related peritonitis. Therefore, we speculated that the stinky tofu might be the source of infection. Aeromonas sobria grow rapidly in summer [9]. The patient we reported here got infected in summer, and the anemia, low albumin, and immunosuppressive status of the patient increased the risk of opportunistic infection. Moreover, hypokalemia caused by vomiting and diarrhea not only decrease intestinal peristalsis, but also increase intestinal permeability, both of which facilitate bacterial translocation [24]. The increased cellulose exudation and fibrin clot formation in the setting of inflammation made peritoneal catheter blocked [25]. In consequence, the patient had to remove the catheter and switch to hemodialysis. Therefore, the patients undergoing PD should pay more attention not to eat any contaminated food, and avoid constipation in order to prevent from opportunistic bacterial infection. Aeromonas species can produce \u03b2-lactamases which make most of them resistant to ampicillin, pencillin and first- or second-generation cephalosporins, while sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides [2, 4, 26\u201328], which is consistent with our drug sensitivity tests. However, our result indicated that Aeromonas sobria was resistant to cefotaxime which belongs to third-generation cephalosporins. Recent literature also suggests that Aeromonas species show an increasing trend of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins [2]. Amikacin and levofloxacin treatment were efficient in this case. The patient finally shifted to hemodialysis with the catheter removed. It\u2019s noteworthy that the third-generation cephalosporins which is well known as the empirical approach to the therapy of bacterial infection caused by Aeromonas sobria may be ineffective sometimes. In conclusion, Aeromonas species are rare causes of PD-related peritonitis. Which should not be ignored. Clinicians should be aware of monitoring the hygiene protocol and retraining patients, especially in such rare cases."}]}]},{"species":"Aeromonas veronii","docs":[{"title":"Lethal Aeromonas veronii Sepsis in the Course of Medicinal Leech Therapy","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Aeromonas veronii cause?","id":"351-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"pneumonia and sepsis","answer_start":329,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"A patient with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) underwent complex surgical tumor therapy, including the reconstruction of soft tissues using a radial forearm flap.

We assume that there is a causal relationship because the patient showed a clear constellation of infection with a massive increase in infection parameters, a classic inflammatory\/septic circulatory failure (see Table 1) and we were not able to detect any pathogen other than A. veronii in the laboratory samples of sputum and blood. Via RAPD typing, we were able to show that the germs from the leeches had been transferred to the patient. The aeromonads from the leeches from the container were genetically identical to those from the blood culture. The microbiome of wild H. verbana contains a large spectrum of pathogen species of various genera ranging from Morganella, Clostridia, Erysipelothrix, and Desulfovibrio to Fusobacteria and is dominated by two species, A. veronii and Mucinivorans hirudinis [10]. A. veronii is an obligate intestinal symbiont that is vertically inherited and assists the leech in blood digestion through the ability to \u03b2-hemolyze [22]. In the directions for the use of these leeches, tightly localized inflammation, associated sometimes with papular efflorescence at the bite sites and often with pruritus, is listed as a common risk (>1\/100), whereas marked local inflammation, e.g., cellulitis, erysipelas, phlegmon, or lymphangitis, is listed as rare (>1\/10,000), and systemic infections with sepsis, e.g., via secondary infection of the wound by different pathogens or by primary infection with A. hydrophila or A. veronii biovar sobria, are listed as very rare (<1\/10,000) [12]. Finally, inflammatory complications have led to the standardization and regulation of leech farming and to the approval of leeches in the United States as a medical device in 2004 [23] and in Germany as a ready-to-use drug in 2005. In this respect, by definition, only leeches in which the feeding blood is free of viral human pathogens and that have completed a minimum 32 week feeding-free quarantine may be shipped in Germany. Microbiological testing prior to shipment must ensure that no human pathogens (e.g., pathogens of the genera Clostridium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Listeria, and Pseudomonas and species of Enterobacteriaceae such as E. coli, or Klebsiella spp.) other than Aeromonas spp. are detectable on the skin or in the leech internal organs. Most gut symbionts of H. medicinalis are not culturable, necessitating the use of DNA-based methods for germ detection and differentiation [23]. Likewise, the transport medium must be free of the abovementioned pathogens [12]. Accordingly, we were only able to detect A. veronii in the tracheal secretions and blood culture of our patient. However, in the leeches themselves, we found other gram-negative bacteria such as Citrobacter werkmannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Comamonas testeroni, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. There are four other case reports of septic complications of leech therapy in the literature to date: in these cases, as in the present case, no antibiotic prophylaxis was received [20] or it was ineffective [24,25]. Evans et al. reported septic complication after infection with A. hydrophila and Enterobacter following the reestablishment of backflow from the hand after an occupational injury to the right hand. When leeches were applied, the patient received cephradine and metronidazole, which proved ineffective [24]. Levine et al. reported on a patient with venous insufficiency after replantation of the thumb and revascularization of fingers 2\u20134. General prophylaxis with ampicillin\u2013sulbactam was continued during leech therapy. After the arrival of findings with evidence of ampicillin\u2013sulbactam-resistant A. veronii biovar sobria, the antibiotic was changed to ciprofloxacin, and the patient\u2019s condition rapidly improved thereafter [25]. Maetz et al. reported on two patients with delayed breast reconstruction via a pedicled TRAM flap. In the first patient, the flap had to be repositioned because of venous congestion, and the patient received leech therapy for 4 days. She then developed a septic infection due to A. veronii and received IV antibiotics with 1.5 g vancomycin\/day and 6 g cefotaxime\/day for 10 days and 350 mg amikacin\/day for 2 days. The fever improved after 4 days of this antibiotic treatment. The other patient was also subjected to two-stage breast reconstruction with a pedicled TRAM flap. Because of venous congestion, she was treated with leeches during postoperative days 2\u20135. On day 8, necrosectomy had to be performed, and 4 g amoxicillin\/clavulanic acid\/day and 160 mg gentamicin\/day were initially given for 2 days to treat septic infection. After the arrival of the microbiology findings, with evidence of A. veronii and the corresponding resistogram, the administered antibiotics were changed to 6 g cefotaxime\/day for 10 days, followed by 400 mg ofloxacin p.o.\/day for 8 days. In this case, the fever again decreased after three days [20]. The flap success rates of leech therapy of 10 case series were documented in a recent meta-analysis by Mousavian et al. The courses of 298 patients could be evaluated, and the success rate for partial or complete salvage was 60.73%; 16.77% of flaps were lost, and the fate of another 22.5% of patients was unknown [8]. Inflammatory complications can develop within the first 24 h (as in our case) or up to a month later [9]. This is thought to be due to secondary spread from necrotic, locally immunocompromised areas [26]. In cases in which inflammatory complications developed, the rate of flap salvage was more than halved across all case series, such as from 88.3% to 37.4% (in this series, 94% Aeromonas spp., mostly A. hydrophila, were the causative pathogens) [13] or from 83% to 31.8% [19]. In our case, the flap showed signs of recovery at the time of the patient\u2019s death, but it was not yet possible to definitively predict whether it would heal. There are no guidelines on the use of leeches based on prospective randomized clinical trials (RCTs) nor evolving risk\u2013benefit profiles [27], but there are recommendations for use. For example, in Germany, the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) advocates that the need for concomitant AB therapy should be decided on an individual basis. Thus, 3rd gen. cephalosporins or gyrase inhibitors should be used [12]. The literature currently consists of reports and case series relating to a few hundred patients and systematic reviews of these cases [13]. The literature reports frequencies of inflammatory complications of 4.7% [3] of cases with AB prophylaxis and 2.4\u201320% in patients without appropriate antibiotics [28]. In such cases, the causative bacteria are mostly Aeromonas spp. (88%) [27]. Accordingly, the majority of SOPs derived from the current literature recommend antibiotic prophylaxis starting at the beginning of leech therapy and continuing for one week thereafter [10] but are still based in part on data obtained prior to the strict regulation of leech manufacturing and marketing in the United States (2004) and Germany (2005). Surveys of plastic surgeons indicate that most use AB prophylaxis, and many use effective prophylaxis. Whitaker et al. surveyed all 62 plastic surgery clinics in England and Ireland about leech therapy practices and received feedback from 50. Of these, 37 (74%) used antibiotic prophylaxis with augmentin (30%), metronidazole (5%), benzyl penicillin and\/or flucloxacillin (14%), ciprofloxacin (22%), and various (24%) [10]. A. veronii can carry different types of beta-lactamases and is always resistant to ampicillin. A variable number of strains are susceptible to ampicillin\u2013sulbactam, and resistance to carbapenems and ciprofloxacin is rare but increasing. Thus, resistance has been increasingly reported in the literature since 2000: Marden et al. reported seven cases from 2011 to 2014 involving limb replantation or flap surgery in which ciprofloxacin-resistant A. hydrophila strains were cultured [23]. A study by Wilmer et al. examined 21 Aeromonas isolates from 26 leech water samples and found that 15 (71.4%) were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, 13 (61.9%) were sensitive to gentamycin, and 21 (100%) were sensitive to sulfamethoxazole\u2013trimethoprim [29]. Whitaker examined three Aeromonas isolates and found that all were resistant to amoxicillin, two were resistant to augmentin, and all were sensitive to ciprofloxacin [30]. In our case, the resistogram was as expected from the literature: Pip\/Taz was used here when pathogens were detected and supplemented with meropenem the following day, but this was no longer sufficient. Pre-therapeutic resistance testing of leeches from the same lot used for therapy would help by facilitating the application of a targeted antibiotic and, thus, not encourage the breeding of further resistance [31]. This is not yet routinely performed in Germany but should be introduced, not least because of this report. To sum up our findings, infections must be considered as a potentially lethal risk in leech therapy. Leeches must be thoroughly rinsed before therapy, and the application site must be disinfected.

Both strains were positive for hemolysin by the plate assay, cytotoxin production at 1:10, and DNase and protease. They were resistant to human serum and negative for acriflavine agglutination, and only one of the strains was autoagglutination positive. Both strains were negative for cell-free hemolysin, hemagglutinins, pectinase, and chitinase.

S. wiggsiae was significantly associated with severe-early childhood caries in the presence and absence of S. mutans. Further S. wiggsiae was elevated in initial carious lesions in adolescents with fixed orthodontic appliances. S. wiggsiae detection was enriched on a low pH agar suggesting acid-tolerance. S. wiggsiae isolates were acid tolerant and produced acid from several sugars at low initial pH values, and were not arginine deiminase positive, characteristics consistent with potential cariogenicity. Cariogenicity of S. wiggsiae was tested in a rat animal model in parallel with S. mutans. While S. wiggsiae by itself showed minimal caries induction, when co-inoculated with S. mutans, there was significant cavity production.    Conclusion:  S. wiggsiae was associated with advanced and initial caries, is acid tolerant and produces acid to low pH at initial neutral and low pH conditions. In combination with S. mutans, S. wiggsiae was detected in caries in an animal model.

Methods and findings:  A prospective study was conducted between 2000 and 2005 to identify patients with leptospirosis presenting to Udon Thani Hospital in northeast Thailand, and to isolate the causative organisms from blood. A multilocus sequence typing scheme was developed to genotype these pathogenic Leptospira. Additional typing was performed for Leptospira isolated from human cases in other Thai provinces over the same period, and from rodents captured in the northeast during 2004. Sequence types (STs) were compared with those of Leptospira drawn from a reference collection. Twelve STs were identified among 101 isolates from patients in Udon Thani. One of these (ST34) accounted for 77 (76%) of isolates. ST34 was Leptospira interrogans, serovar Autumnalis. 86% of human Leptospira isolates from Udon Thani corresponded to ST34 in 2000\/2001, but this figure fell to 56% by 2005 as the outbreak waned (p = 0.01). ST34 represented 17\/24 (71%) of human isolates from other Thai provinces, and 7\/8 (88%) rodent isolates. By contrast, 59 STs were found among 76 reference strains, indicating a much more diverse population genetic structure; ST34 was not identified in this collection.

The vast variations in clinical presentations hinder the early accurate diagnosis, hence laboratory confirmation is critically needed to support the manifested signs and symptoms for initiating the treatment. In the present study, 92\/165 patients with clinical manifestations suggesting leptospirosis were confirmed through MAT and\/or PCR. The mean age of the leptospirosis confirmed patients was 42.23 \u00b1 18.07, which is in agreement with several other studies that ranged between 38.9\u201345 years [23\u201327]. About two thirds of the patients (n = 60; 65%) were males as observed in most studies [24\u201326, 28, 29]. Although leptospirosis can affect all age groups and both genders, active involvement in outdoor activities increases its incidence in adults and males. More than half (54.3%) of the patients had a history of contact with rats indicating that exposure to rats increases their risk of getting the disease [30]. Secondly, we found outdoor activities as the major risk factor which is in agreement with our earlier finding and also elsewhere [30\u201333]. While it is true that flood increases the number of leptospirosis cases, in the present study, only one out of the 92 confirmed cases reported floodwater exposure. Hence, we were not able to associate flood with leptospirosis for this current study. Fever, respiratory problems, headache, myalgia, chills and rigors were observed in most confirmed leptospirosis patients which agree with several other studies reported earlier [5, 23\u201329, 34, 35]. However, in addition to the traditional symptoms mentioned above, we observed gastrointestinal problems such as vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea in as many as 58.7% of confirmed leptospirosis cases. Another major challenge with the febrile illness is the co-infections with one or more pathogens which further complicates the diagnosis and thereby the clinical management. In the present study, we found seven leptospirosis patients to be co-infected with dengue and one with scrub typhus. Leptospirosis co-infection with dengue or scrub typhus is commonly seen in neighbouring countries such as Thailand and India [36\u201343]. Dengue is highly endemic in Malaysia with a minimum of 100,000 cases and more than 200 mortalities every year [44]. A recent study by Suppiah et al. (2017) reported 11\/268 (4.1%) dengue cases to be co-infected with leptospirosis [45]. Although leptospirosis is endemic in Malaysia, the lack of clinical awareness and the evaluation of co-infection with dengue is often neglected, hence delays the appropriate management. It is difficult to differentiate between leptospirosis, dengue and scrub typhus solely based on clinical manifestations due to the overlapping signs and symptoms [46]. Thus, it is important to perform differential diagnosis among the three diseases not only based on the signs and symptoms but also through laboratory confirmation for effective management of the patients. Molecular characterization based on 16S rDNA sequencing identified three Leptospira species (L. interrogans, L. kirschneri, and L. wolffii) to cause human leptospirosis in Central Malaysia. All three species have been previously isolated and identified from humans, animals or the environment in Malaysia. L. kirschneri and L. interrogans, the most common and widely distributed Leptospira species from rodents and small mammals [13,30, 47\u201351] were identified as the main human-infecting Leptospira species in Malaysia based on our study. L. wolffii, an intermediate species was detected in the blood of two patients. This species was initially isolated and described in human leptospirosis in Thailand [52] and has also been isolated from animals [53]. In Malaysia, earlier reports described the isolation of L. wolffii from soils and waters in residential areas of patients with leptospirosis [54], market and recreational areas [55]. This also further illustrates the contribution of Leptospira from the \u201cintermediate\u201d cluster as causes of human leptospirosis. We found a significant difference in the prevalence of Leptospira species identified in both states (Table 3), L. kirschneri was commonly found in Selangor, while L. interrogans largely predominated in Perak. However, reasons for the regional species domination is not clear and needs further research. MLST is a gold standard typing method and useful for investigation of the evolutionary relationship between closely-related bacteria [56]. However, this method requires a high bacterial load (~5x10 leptospires\/ml). Consequently, success rates for obtaining partial and full profiles in clinical specimens were between 5% and 21% [57, 58]. An extended MLST based on nested PCR for typing of clinical samples was recently established by Weiss et al., and showed an improvement in obtaining full allelic profiles with 23% success rate [19]. Our present study utilized this extended MLST and from 63 samples tested, only one and eight Leptospira DNA from patients had full and partial allelic profiles respectively. The most frequently amplified loci were the glmU and pntA, which was also observed elsewhere [56]. The assignment of a new ST (ST 265) for the one sample that exhibited complete MLST profile implies that the locally distributed Leptospira strain is genetically distinct from those circulating internationally and in other geographic regions. These findings suggest the need to isolate the human-infecting strains in Malaysia to be included in the MAT panel to improve the diagnostic sensitivity. As reported by Mgode et al., the inclusion of local circulating serovars in the MAT panel could improve leptospirosis diagnosis [59]. In another study performed in Thailand, the leptospires serovars mostly found in patients were also the dominant serovars circulating in livestock [60]. In the present study, although similar species were identified among human and rodents [13], no link could be established at ST level. Based on the organized MLST allele pattern in Table 4, only ST 58 L. interrogans identified in human leptospirosis from Indonesia (neighbouring country) showed alleles for glmU, pntA, sucA and caiB similar to ST 265 L. interrogans observed in human samples in Malaysia. These data show that although similar species could be isolated from human and rodents, they are genetically different. Furthermore, Leptospira could be shed by other mammals like dogs, bats, livestock; hence, the reservoirs discovery deserves further research [61\u201365]. Our study has several strengths and limitations. We have identified L. interrogans, L. kirschneri and L. wolffii as the human-infecting Leptospira species in Malaysia. However, to conclude whether the same strain that is present in the rodent kidneys or in the environment is causing infection in human, it is crucial to identify the genotype to establish the epidemiological linkage. Although the MLST could be revealed for the Leptospira species isolated from rodents in our earlier study [13], the fact that no strains could be isolated from human samples or the DNA extracted from the blood samples was too little for performing PCR for all the seven alleles limits the epidemiological linkage understanding. Another major limitation of the study was the non-inclusion of urine samples to detect the late phase of illness as PCR is positive in blood only in the early phase and MAT in the immune phase (serum). The combination of both PCR and MAT for detection of leptospires in blood, serum and urine in both phases will be more robust and improve the diagnosis sensitivity. Hence, we recommend to perform a nationwide study to isolate and characterize the human-infecting strains from patients (blood and urine), continuous surveillance of animals (livestock, cats, dogs, bats) and the environment, as it is crucial to identify the genotype for determining the risk factors and effective management. In summary, L. interrogans, L. kirschneri, and L. wolffii were identified as human-infecting species in Malaysia. ST 265 L. interrogans could be the major circulating genotype as 4\/9 strains showed similar alleles for glmU, pntA and mreA, while others could be distinct STs. More studies on identifying the locally circulating Leptospira species from patients, animals and the environment are recommended to leverage our knowledge of the local epidemiology, for improving the diagnosis panel, hence assuring the effective management of the illness."}]}]},{"species":"Leptospira kirschneri","docs":[{"title":"Leptospira interrogans and Leptospira kirschneri are the dominant Leptospira species causing human leptospirosis in Central Malaysia","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Leptospira kirschneri cause?","id":"355-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"human leptospirosis","answer_start":1470,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Leptospirosis, commonly known as rat-urine disease, is a global but endemic zoonotic disease in the tropics.

Leptospirosis co-infection with dengue or scrub typhus is commonly seen in neighbouring countries such as Thailand and India [36\u201343]. Dengue is highly endemic in Malaysia with a minimum of 100,000 cases and more than 200 mortalities every year [44]. A recent study by Suppiah et al. (2017) reported 11\/268 (4.1%) dengue cases to be co-infected with leptospirosis [45]. Although leptospirosis is endemic in Malaysia, the lack of clinical awareness and the evaluation of co-infection with dengue is often neglected, hence delays the appropriate management. It is difficult to differentiate between leptospirosis, dengue and scrub typhus solely based on clinical manifestations due to the overlapping signs and symptoms [46]. Thus, it is important to perform differential diagnosis among the three diseases not only based on the signs and symptoms but also through laboratory confirmation for effective management of the patients. Molecular characterization based on 16S rDNA sequencing identified three Leptospira species (L. interrogans, L. kirschneri, and L. wolffii) to cause human leptospirosis in Central Malaysia. All three species have been previously isolated and identified from humans, animals or the environment in Malaysia. L. kirschneri and L. interrogans, the most common and widely distributed Leptospira species from rodents and small mammals [13,30, 47\u201351] were identified as the main human-infecting Leptospira species in Malaysia based on our study. L. wolffii, an intermediate species was detected in the blood of two patients. This species was initially isolated and described in human leptospirosis in Thailand [52] and has also been isolated from animals [53]. In Malaysia, earlier reports described the isolation of L. wolffii from soils and waters in residential areas of patients with leptospirosis [54], market and recreational areas [55]. This also further illustrates the contribution of Leptospira from the \u201cintermediate\u201d cluster as causes of human leptospirosis. We found a significant difference in the prevalence of Leptospira species identified in both states (Table 3), L. kirschneri was commonly found in Selangor, while L. interrogans largely predominated in Perak. However, reasons for the regional species domination is not clear and needs further research. MLST is a gold standard typing method and useful for investigation of the evolutionary relationship between closely-related bacteria [56]. However, this method requires a high bacterial load (~5x10 leptospires\/ml). Consequently, success rates for obtaining partial and full profiles in clinical specimens were between 5% and 21% [57, 58]. An extended MLST based on nested PCR for typing of clinical samples was recently established by Weiss et al., and showed an improvement in obtaining full allelic profiles with 23% success rate [19]. Our present study utilized this extended MLST and from 63 samples tested, only one and eight Leptospira DNA from patients had full and partial allelic profiles respectively. The most frequently amplified loci were the glmU and pntA, which was also observed elsewhere [56]. The assignment of a new ST (ST 265) for the one sample that exhibited complete MLST profile implies that the locally distributed Leptospira strain is genetically distinct from those circulating internationally and in other geographic regions. These findings suggest the need to isolate the human-infecting strains in Malaysia to be included in the MAT panel to improve the diagnostic sensitivity. As reported by Mgode et al., the inclusion of local circulating serovars in the MAT panel could improve leptospirosis diagnosis [59]. In another study performed in Thailand, the leptospires serovars mostly found in patients were also the dominant serovars circulating in livestock [60]. In the present study, although similar species were identified among human and rodents [13], no link could be established at ST level. Based on the organized MLST allele pattern in Table 4, only ST 58 L. interrogans identified in human leptospirosis from Indonesia (neighbouring country) showed alleles for glmU, pntA, sucA and caiB similar to ST 265 L. interrogans observed in human samples in Malaysia. These data show that although similar species could be isolated from human and rodents, they are genetically different. Furthermore, Leptospira could be shed by other mammals like dogs, bats, livestock; hence, the reservoirs discovery deserves further research [61\u201365]. Our study has several strengths and limitations. We have identified L. interrogans, L. kirschneri and L. wolffii as the human-infecting Leptospira species in Malaysia. However, to conclude whether the same strain that is present in the rodent kidneys or in the environment is causing infection in human, it is crucial to identify the genotype to establish the epidemiological linkage. Although the MLST could be revealed for the Leptospira species isolated from rodents in our earlier study [13], the fact that no strains could be isolated from human samples or the DNA extracted from the blood samples was too little for performing PCR for all the seven alleles limits the epidemiological linkage understanding. Another major limitation of the study was the non-inclusion of urine samples to detect the late phase of illness as PCR is positive in blood only in the early phase and MAT in the immune phase (serum). The combination of both PCR and MAT for detection of leptospires in blood, serum and urine in both phases will be more robust and improve the diagnosis sensitivity. Hence, we recommend to perform a nationwide study to isolate and characterize the human-infecting strains from patients (blood and urine), continuous surveillance of animals (livestock, cats, dogs, bats) and the environment, as it is crucial to identify the genotype for determining the risk factors and effective management. In summary, L. interrogans, L. kirschneri, and L. wolffii were identified as human-infecting species in Malaysia. ST 265 L. interrogans could be the major circulating genotype as 4\/9 strains showed similar alleles for glmU, pntA and mreA, while others could be distinct STs. More studies on identifying the locally circulating Leptospira species from patients, animals and the environment are recommended to leverage our knowledge of the local epidemiology, for improving the diagnosis panel, hence assuring the effective management of the illness."}]}]},{"species":"Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae","docs":[{"title":"Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"357-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-positive","answer_start":89,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae normally exist?","id":"357-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"environment, including marine locations","answer_start":492,"id":1},{"text":"a wide variety of wild and domestic animals, birds and fish","answer_start":568,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae cause?","id":"357-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"a localised cutaneous lesion form, erysipeloid, a generalised cutaneous form and a septicaemic form often associated with endocarditis","answer_start":276,"id":1},{"text":"Swine erysipelas","answer_start":629,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae?","id":"357-1-1-4","answers":[{"text":"bacillus","answer_start":103,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is a facultative, non-spore-forming, non-acid-fast, small, Gram-positive bacillus. The organism was first established as a human pathogen late in the nineteenth century. Three forms of human disease have been recognised since then. These include a localised cutaneous lesion form, erysipeloid, a generalised cutaneous form and a septicaemic form often associated with endocarditis. The organism is ubiquitous and able to persist for a long period of time in the environment, including marine locations. It is a pathogen or a commensal in a wide variety of wild and domestic animals, birds and fish. Swine erysipelas caused by E. rhusiopathiae is the disease of greatest prevalence and economic importance. Diseases in other animals include erysipelas of farmed turkeys, chickens, ducks and emus, and polyarthritis in sheep and lambs. Infection due to E. rhusiopathiae in humans is occupationally related, principally occurring as a result of contact with contaminated animals, their products or wastes, or soil. Erysipeloid is the most common form of infections in humans. While it has been suggested that the incidence of human infection could be declining due to technological advances in animal industries, infection still occurs in specific environments. Additionally, infection by the organism is possibly under-diagnosed due to the resemblance it bears to other infections, and problems encountered in isolation and identification. Various virulence factors have been suggested as being involved in the pathogenicity of E. rhusiopathiae. The presence of a hyaluronidase and neuraminidase has been recognised, and it was shown that neuraminidase plays a significant role in bacterial attachment and subsequent invasion into host cells. The role of hyaluronidase in the disease process is controversial. The presence of a heat labile capsule has been reported as important in virulence. Control of animal disease by sound husbandry, herd management, good sanitation and immunization procedures is recommended.

Human infection can result from a bite or scratch from an infected or colonized rat or consumption of contaminated food or water.1 Children, pet owners, pet shop and animal research laboratory workers are more susceptible to infection.

A third syndrome is Haverhill fever, caused by ingestion of S. moniliformis-contaminated food [1]. Case reports describe exposures among people living in poverty, laboratory technicians, and pet store workers. The affected demographics have broadened, as rats have become more popular pets. S. moniliformis colonizes the nasopharynx of 50\u2013100% of healthy wild, lab, and pet rats, and is also excreted in the urine [2]. It is also found in mice, guinea pigs, gerbils, and squirrels. After a bite or scratch, the wound should be immediately cleaned with soap and warm water, and tetanus prophylaxis administered, if warranted. The efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis for rat bite is unknown. Some authors suggest administration of amoxicillin\/clavulanate at a dosage of 500 mg p.o. every 8 h for 3 days. S. moniliformis is a pleomorphic (straight, fusiform, or with lateral bulbar swellings), filamentous, Gram-negative, nonmotile, and non-acid-fast rod [1]. However, on Gram stains it can appear as either Gram-negative or Gram-positive rods. Rat bite fever typically begins with a bite or other exposure, followed by abrupt onset of systemic illness, including intermittent relapsing fever, arthritis, and rash 3 days to 3 weeks later. A maculopapular, petechial, or purpuric rash develops in approximately 75% of those affected in the first symptomatic week [1, 2]. Over half of those affected develop migratory polyarthralgias, with involvement of both large and small joints of the extremities [1]. If untreated, the mortality rate approaches 10% [2]. Endocarditis is a well-described complication, but only 26 cases of native valve endocarditis have been reported to date [3]. We found no reports involving pregnant patients. Our patient\u2019s presentation was notably atypical in multiple respects. First, the hyperemesis she experienced was likely wrongly attributed to pregnancy and contributed to delayed diagnosis. Second, she denied a history of rash or arthralgias. Third, eroded intra-oral hardware made fastidious Streptococcal spp. or other oral flora equally likely pathogens. Fourth, the diagnosis of the primary infectious agent in this case was further complicated by the positive Bartonella IgG titers. Bartonella IgG titers between 1:64 and 1:256 represent possible active or recent Bartonella infection; our patient\u2019s IgG titers were 1:256. IgM titers > 1:20 strongly suggest current infection; our patients IgM titers were negative. Furthermore, she had no characteristic cutaneous lesions or lymphadenopathy, and there was no Bartonella signal detected on the PCR. Taken together, the above essentially rule out Bartonella endocarditis. Another confounder was the identification of Propionibacterium spp. on the mitral valve specimen. Propionibacterium spp. are a very rare cause of infectious endocarditis, and almost always cause prosthetic valve endocarditis. Here, they were most likely a contaminant. Finally, she suffered septic emboli to the right popliteal artery, spleen, and kidneys - a rare complication of rat bite fever endocarditis [4]. Diagnosis of S. moniliformis is difficult, requiring a high index of suspicion. It is fastidious, requiring microaerophilic conditions (5\u201310% CO2 or anaerobic conditions supplemented with 20% normal rabbit serum) [2]. Furthermore, growth is inhibited by 0.05% sodium polyanethol sulfonate (an anticoagulant routinely added to most aerobic blood culture bottles) [1]. When blood cultures remain negative after prolonged incubation, PCR can be used diagnostically. 16sRNA gene sequencing has been used successfully on heart valves, bone, and synovial fluid, but this method is specific only to the Streptobacillus genus and not the species [5]. PCR is effective even after antibiotic treatment has been initiated, even if the blood culture is sterile, as the DNA remains detectable in the infected valve. In this case, blood and valve cultures were persistently negative, despite repeated anaerobic and aerobic sub culturing on various agars and broths including Chocolate, Charcoal Yeast Extract, Columbia, and serum supplemented media. The initial mitral valve specimen was collected surgically 4 days after initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy, likely contributing to the difficulty in culturing the specimen. Broad range bacterial PCR and sequencing of a segment of 16 s rRNA gene matched to Streptobacillus sp. (genus level) and most closely related to Streptobacillus moniliformis (species level). Speciation of 16 s rRNA gene sometimes can be difficult and erroneous. The patient was counseled about the risks associated with rats especially pertaining to bites. Recommended treatment of S. moniliformis endocarditis is dual therapy with high-dose penicillin G for 4 weeks in combination with streptomycin or gentamicin for 2 weeks [1, 2]. Ceftriaxone (2gIV daily for 6 weeks) has also been effective [3]. In this case, treatment was limited by the patient\u2019s pregnancy until she underwent dilation and evacuation. Aminoglycosides are pregnancy class D, given several reports of congenital deafness; they are known to cross the placenta. A literature review was performed by a professional medical librarian using the search strategy presented in the supplemental file. This revealed only two cases, but neither involved endocarditis [6, 7]. One involved a 22 year old woman who developed Streptobacillus moniliformis amnionitis [6], and the other involved polymicrobial chorioamnionitis with Aerococcus christensenii, Gemella spp., Snethia spp., Parvimonas micra, and Streptobacillus moniliformis in a pregnant woman [7]. Our report is limited by the usual features of a single case report, and that more and different samples were not available for duplicate and triplicate laboratory testing. Despite these limitations, it includes the key laboratory and management detail useful for providers who may encounter this in the future, and it appears to be a first reported case based on a thorough literature review described in the supplemental material. This case highlights the diagnostic and management challenges of an infrequent cause culture negative endocarditis that was further complicated by pregnancy, thromboembolic phenomenon, and a patient\u2019s undaunted love of her pets."}]}]},{"species":"Staphylococcus simiae","docs":[{"title":"Staphylococcus simiae sp. nov., isolated from South American squirrel monkeys","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Staphylococcus simiae normally exist?","id":"360-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gastrointestinal tracts of South American squirrel monkeys","answer_start":117,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Staphylococcus simiae sensitive to?","id":"360-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"novobiocin","answer_start":48,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Staphylococcus simiae resistant to?","id":"360-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"polymyxin B","answer_start":743,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Eight coagulase-negative, oxidase-negative and novobiocin-susceptible staphylococcal strains were isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of South American squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus L.). These strains were differentiated from known staphylococcal species on the basis of 16S rRNA gene and hsp60 gene sequencing, and from the most closely related species by using DNA-DNA hybridization, ribotyping, whole-cell protein profiles and biotyping. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences confirmed that these strains are members of the Staphylococcus aureus species group (99% similarity) but are biochemically similar to Staphylococcus piscifermentans, from which they can be phenotypically distinguished by resistance to polymyxin B, acid production from D-mannitol, the inability to hydrolyse aesculin and DNA and the absence of alpha-glucosidase. On the basis of these analyses, a novel species of the genus Staphylococcus is described, for which the name Staphylococcus simiae sp. nov. is proposed, with CCM 7213(T) (=LMG 22723(T)) as the type strain.
