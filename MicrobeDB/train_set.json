They produce a distinctive yellow to orange pigment on blood agar [3-4]. The most frequent isolates of Chryseobacterium species include Chryseobacterium indologenes, C. meningosepticum, and C. gleum. C. indologenes was formerly known as flavobacterium indologenes. Bacteremia due to C. indologenes was first described in Taiwan by Hsue et al. [5]. It is found naturally in soil, water, plants, and food products. It is not normally found in the human microflora [4, 6]. In the hospital setting, C. indologenes may be found in water systems and on wet surfaces which serve as a potential reservoir of infection. It resists chlorination and can survive in municipal water supplies [7]. Nosocomial infections due to C. indologenes have been linked to the use of indwelling devices during a hospital stay. Additionally, the colonization of patients through contaminated medical devices involving fluids such as respirators, endotracheal tubes, mist tents, humidifiers, incubator for newborns, ice chests, and syringes has been reported [3, 7-8]. Most common related infections include bacteremia, pneumonia, meningitis, pyomyositis, keratitis, and also indwelling device-associated infections such as urinary tract, surgical, and burn wound infections [2]. The clinical significance of C. indologenes has not yet been established as it has not been frequently recovered from clinical specimens. Most strains of C. indologenes do not grow on MacConkey agar, but grow well on blood agar after 24 h incubation at 37\u00b0C [3-4].  This bacteria produces a biofilm on foreign materials (i.e., indwelling devices) and protease activity that may play an important role in the virulence of invasive infections [4, 9]. C. indologenes was first reported in 1993 by Bhagawati et al. in a patient presenting with ventilator-associated pneumonia [10]. Later, more cases presenting as bacteremia, pneumonia, meningitis, pyomyositis, keratitis, and also contaminated surgically implanted devices have been reported [1, 6, 8, 11]. Appropriate choice of antimicrobial agents is challenging due to the unpredictability and multiple drug resistance of this microorganism to antibiotics [3].

The increase in clinical usage of colistin and tigecycline against emerging carbapenem-resistant pathogens has been associated with significant problems in the critical care setting [3, 9]. Alon et al. (2018) presented a cohort of seven patients who presented bacteremia with C. indologenes in which most common characteristics of these patients were immunocompromised state with multiple comorbidities that have undergone a surgical procedure. They also reported similar resistance sensitivity patterns to previous reports in the literature. The most potent agents reported against C. indologenes are quinolones (gatifloxacin and levofloxacin) and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (>95% susceptibility). Ciprofloxacin, cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, and rifampin showed significant susceptibility. Furthermore, as per the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program (1997-2001), vancomycin, chloramphenicol, linezolid, and glycopeptides are not appropriate choices for treating infections due to this organism [8, 10]. In most cases, duration of therapy for bacteremia ranges from 7 to 14 days. Our patient responded successfully to the regimen received; therefore, the decision was made to provide a 10-day course of antibiotics. Although our patient has his permacath catheter removed some researchers have reported eradication of bacteria without removal of indwelling catheters [9]. Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation was initially attempted but due to multiple episodes of CLABSI, this procedure had been deferred until stable resolution of his bacteremia. Suggested mortality rate associated to infections with C. indologenes is around 17% [6]."}]},{"title":"Rare case of meningitis due to an emerging pathogen Chryseobacterium indologenes","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Chryseobacterium indologenes is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"1-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":57,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Chryseobacterium indologenes cause?","id":"1-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"a variety of infections like nosocomial pneumonia, bacteremia and wound infections usually in immunosuppressed patients and those with indwelling devices","answer_start":137,"id":1},{"text":"meningitis","answer_start":422,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Chryseobacterium indologenes sensitive to?","id":"1-2-1-3","answers":[{"text":"trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole combination","answer_start":603,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Chryseobacterium indologenes normally exist?","id":"1-2-1-4","answers":[{"text":"widely distributed in nature","answer_start":80,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Chryseobacterium indologenes is a non-glucose fermenting Gram-negative bacteria widely distributed in nature.

It is oxidase and catalase positive, produces the pigment flexirubin and hydrolyses gelatin and esculin. In 1993, Bonten et al. first isolated a strain of C. indologenes from the tracheal aspirate of a patient with ventilator-associated pneumonia but the pathogenic role was unclear. Later its invasive nature in humans and significance as a true pathogen was identified in Taiwan. Since then, it has been found to cause a wide range of infections including nosocomial pneumonia, intraabdominal infection, wound infection, primary bacteremia, intravascular catheter\u2013related bacteremia and cellulitis. Some of the major risk factors identified with infection are immunocompromised status, indwelling devices like tracheostomy tubes and patients with diabetes. C. indologenes is intrinsically resistant to carbapenems and cephalosporins due to the production of molecular class A \u03b2-lactamase and class B carbapenem-hydrolyzing \u03b2-lactamase. Its presence in the inaminate objects in the hospital, ability to infect immunocompromised patients and intrinsic resistance to antibiotics could prove to be the decisive factor for the unfavourable outcomes in the hospitalized patients.

C. indologenes is a non-motile, catalase-positive, indole-positive, oxidase-positive, non-glucose fermenting Gram-negative bacteria widely distributed in nature and is responsible for nosocomial infections. Although not a normal component of human microbiota, its presence in the hospital environment (wet surfaces and water sources) poses a significant risk. The predisposing factors for infection include immunocompromised status, malignancy, neutropenia, diabetes, organ transplant, steroid use, malnutrition and indwelling devices like respirators, endotracheal tracheostomy tubes, mist tents humidifiers and so on. The organism\u2019s ability to produce protease and biofilms on indwelling devices play an important role in invasive infections. Most cases with C. indologenes infections are catheter-related bacteremia and nosocomial pneumonia, with very few studies reporting it to be the causative agent for meningitis. Resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, clindamycin and teicoplanin makes the infections caused by Chryseobacterium spp. difficult to treat. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme showed that the most active antimicrobial were the quinolones, especially the newer agents (levofloxacin, garenoxacin and gatifloxacin). The isolate in our study was found to be resistant to levofloxacin with minimum inhibitory concentration \u2a7e8. However, it was found to be susceptible to trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole and minocycline similar to what was seen by Chou et al. Initially, in our case the organism was thought to be an environmental contaminant as subsequent cultures did not yield this organism but instead growth of Acinetobacter spp. was seen in repeated CSF samples. When Chryseobacterium spp. was isolated from the patient in subsequent cultures, it was believed to be the pathogen responsible for causing meningitis in this patient. This is important because if treatment was directed against C. indologenes from the beginning, then the patient could have improved faster reducing the days of hospitalization. Trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole combination was started and the EVD was replaced. There is no clear rule that indwelling catheters should be removed or not with studies citing it to be a necessity while others proving that all catheters need not be removed. The CSF samples collected from the patient later did not yield any bacterial growth and the patient was successfully treated."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Chryseobacterium indologenes cause?","id":"1-2-4-1","answers":[{"text":"meningitis","answer_start":15,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"C. indologenes meningitis can occur in patients having indwelling devices and prolonged hospitalization but it can be successfully treated by giving appropriate antibiotics based on the antibiotic susceptibility pattern."}]},{"title":"A Case of Healthcare Associated Pneumonia Caused by Chryseobacterium indologenes in an Immunocompetent Patient","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Chryseobacterium indologenes is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"1-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":73,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Chryseobacterium indologenes normally exist?","id":"1-3-1-2","answers":[{"text":"plants, soil, foodstuffs, and water","answer_start":128,"id":1},{"text":"hospital environment","answer_start":181,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Chryseobacterium indologenes's requirement for oxygen?","id":"1-3-1-3","answers":[{"text":"aerobic","answer_start":87,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Chryseobacterium indologenes?","id":"1-3-1-4","answers":[{"text":"bacilli","answer_start":95,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Chryseobacterium indologenes is nonmotile, oxidase, and indole positive Gram-negative aerobic bacilli which is widely found in plants, soil, foodstuffs, and water.

Immune suppression, comorbidities, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and extreme age are other important risk factors for Chryseobacterium infections [13]. C. indologenes has not been frequently recovered from clinical specimens but infections have been associated with a high mortality rate [14]. Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern is not well defined because it is a rare pathogen isolated from clinical specimens. Production of class A b-lactamase and class B carbapenem-hydrolyzing b-lactamase molecules causes intrinsic carbapenem and cephalosporin resistance. It is usually susceptible to levofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and piperacillin-tazobactam. Ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and ceftazidime have also high activity against C. indologenes. Therefore, it is usually resistant to aminoglycosides, other b-lactams, chloramphenicol, linezolid, and glycopeptides [6, 15\u201317]. SENTRY Program [2] during the 5-year period 1997 to 2001 revealed that Chryseobacterium species constitute only 0.03% of all bacterial isolates. All strains came from hospitalized patients. C. meningosepticum was the most frequently isolated microorganism followed by C. indologenes. Lower respiratory tract (52%) and blood (46%) were the major sites microorganism isolated. One-half of the isolates from the respiratory tract were C. indologenes and 42.3% were C. meningosepticum. The highest frequency of Chryseobacterium spp. infection occurred among the patients over 65 years old. The largest case series including 91 pneumonia and 22 bacteremia patients is reported by Chen et al. [11] from Taiwan. Mechanical ventilation, use of corticosteroids, malignancy, chronic renal disease, hypertensive cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and tracheostomy were the most frequent underlying medical conditions in patients. Almost 40% of patients had history of previous carbapenem, quinolone, or broad-spectrum cephalosporin use. They also reported a correlation between C. indologenes isolation and increasing consumption of colistin or tigecycline. Mortality was 35% for pneumonia and 64% for bacteremia. The vast majority of reports of C. indologenes infections have been published as case reports. Immunosuppression, older age, prolonged antibiotic use, and trauma were the most common clinical features reported in the majority of case reports [6, 12, 15, 16, 18\u201321].

Methods:  With 215 C indologenes isolates between January 1, 2004 and September 30, 2011, at a medical center, we analyzed the relationship between the prevalence of C indologenes infections and total prescription of colistin and tigecycline, clinical manifestation, antibiotic susceptibility, and outcomes.    Results:  Colistin and tigecycline were introduced into clinical use at this medical center since August 2006. The increasing numbers of patients with C indologenes pneumonia and bacteremia correlated to increased consumption of colistin (p = 0.018) or tigecycline (p = 0.049). Among patients with bacteremia and pneumonia, the in-hospital mortality rate was 63.6% and 35.2% (p = 0.015), respectively. Administration of appropriate antibiotics showed significant benefit in 14-day survival in patients with C indologenes bloodstream infection (p = 0.040). In bacteremic patients, old cardiovascular accident (p = 0.036) and cancer (p = 0.014) were the most common comorbidity. The most common co-infection pathogen in patients with C indologenes pneumonia was Acinetobacter baumannii (36\/91, 39.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23\/91, 25.3%), carbapenem-resistant A baumannii (22\/91, 24.2%), and Klebseilla pneumoniae (13\/91, 14.3%). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the 215 isolates showed that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was the most active agent (susceptibility rate: 87.4%), followed by cefoperazone-sulbactam (48.0%).    Conclusion:  The present study showed a trend of increasing prevalence of C indologenes infection after introduction of colistin and tigecycline usage. The bacteremia group had higher mortality rate than the pneumonia group. Increasing resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, and newer fluoroquinolone were noticed in our analysis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was a potential antimicrobial agent in vitro for C indologenes. To avoid collateral damage, we emphasize the importance of antibiotic stewardship program.

For patients with deep-seated thoracic infections, 2 to 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics are advised, followed by oral penicillins for six to twelve months [4]. An extensive review of the literature since 1939 revealed 24 well-described cases of endocarditis due to Actinomyces including six cases of Actinomyces species [5\u20139], two of Actinomyces bovis [10, 11], four of Actinomyces viscosus [12\u201315], two cases of Actinomyces meyeri [16, 17], three of Actinomyces israelii [18\u201320], two of Actinomyces neuii [21, 22], and one of each of Actinomyces septicus [23], Actinomyces muris [24], Actinomyces pyogenes [25], Actinomyces funkei [26], and Actinomyces odontolyticus [27] (Table 1). Almost half of these patients were noted to have predisposing cardiac pathology. One recent report described a case of eustachian valve endocarditis caused by Actinomyces turicensis [28]. Four of the 20 patients who received therapy died from pulmonary edema and acute respiratory failure. Three patients underwent aortic valve replacement surgery and survived. Most of the patients received a beta-lactam antibiotic (mainly penicillin), but few received other classes of antibiotics (glycopeptide, sulfonamide, aminoglycoside, and chloramphenicol). In 15 patients, duration of antibiotic therapy was stated and ranged from 24 days to 13 months (mean 21.4 weeks, median 16 weeks). Case reports of endocarditis caused by Actinomyces species. UK: unknown, PCN: penicillin, CTX: ceftriaxone, Amp: ampicillin, Gent: gentamicin, Vanc: vancomycin, Ert: ertapenem, and \u2217valve replacement surgery. To our knowledge, this is the first case of Actinomyces naeslundii endocarditis reported in the literature to date and the second of prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by Actinomyces [22]. Grundmann et al. described a case of Actinomyces neuii prosthetic valve endocarditis also managed successfully with medical treatment alone (6-week intravenous regimen of penicillin followed by oral amoxicillin for 11 months) [22]. Similar to the treatment of other serious Actinomyces infections, endocarditis requires several weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy, followed by six to twelve months of oral therapy. High doses of penicillin, for a prolonged period of time, remain the therapy of choice [29]."}]}]},{"species":"Corynebacterium amycolatum","docs":[{"title":"Corynebacterium amycolatum: An Unexpected Pathogen in the Ear","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can C.amycolatum cause?","id":"3-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"pyogenic ear infections","answer_start":1227,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Non-diphtheritic Corynebacteria are now being increasingly recognised as the causative agents of various infections.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on its role in ear infections. Here, we present 12 cases of ear infection with C.amycolatum. A high index of suspicion is necessary for identification of these gram positive bacilli as they resemble other Corynebacterium species on gram stain.

These organisms are frequently resistant to ceftriaxone and imipenem. In our study, among the 12 isolates, eight isolates were resistant to ceftriaxone and four to imipenem and two were intermediately susceptible to ceftriaxone although all the 12 strains were uniformly susceptible to vancomycin. All the isolates were negative for toxA and toxB genes by PCR. Genomic sequencing of two isolates confirmed them as C.amycolatum. C.amycolatum is a relatively rare cause of pyogenic ear infections.

Other Corynebacterium species like C.amycolatum, C.aurimucosum, C.glucuronolyticum, C.jeikeium, C.pseudodiphtheriticum, C.striatum, C.tuberculostearicum and C.urealyticum are isolated in the laboratory [3]. Corynebacteria are part of the normal skin flora, therefore it becomes difficult to distinguish between infection, colonization, and contamination when these organisms are isolated from purulent ear specimens. Attribution of a causal role is strengthened when polymorphonuclear leukocytes are observed in the clinical specimen along with gram positive bacilli, especially in the absence of any other pathogen [4]. In our study, all the 12 cases had the presence of polymorphonuclear cells with gram positive bacilli. Moreover, all the cases had heavy growth of the organism which is also suggestive of its role in the infection. Corynebacterium amycolatum is a gram positive bacilli arranged in palisades. As other non-pathogenic corynebacteria resemble C.amycolatum, the microbiological diagnosis is frequently missed, if care is not taken to identify the isolate. Esteban et al., have reported that 82% of the isolates which were previously identified as Corynebacterium xerosis actually turned out to be C.amycolatum when retested [4]. C.amycolatum is associated with septicaemia, endocarditis, meningitis, septic arthritis and urinary tract infections [2]. C.amycolatum is most commonly isolated from wound swabs (61.5%), urine (14.3%), drain swabs (7.1%) [5]. However, a causative role for this organism in otitis media still remains obscure. In a study by Aalbaek et al., C.amycolatum was found to be associated with canine otitis externa [6]. We have detected 12 cases of C.amycolatum in individuals with ear infection. These patients were either immunocompromised or have had previous surgical interventions. PCR and genomic sequencing identified the organism as C.amycolatum. Out of these patients seven had pure growth of C.amycolatum while the rest had growth of other organisms. In absence of any other organism, C.amycolatum is most likely to be the causative agent of the infection. Though the outcome was not known in most of the patients, one patient showed persistence of infection as evidenced by isolation of the same agent 3 months later. C.amycolatum is frequently resistant to many antimicrobials. C.amycolatum causing endocarditis was found to be resistant to multiple antibiotics [7]. There are reports stating that the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics led to an increase of sepsis due to the species C.jeikeium and C.amycolatum [8]. In a study done on surgical site infections it was seen that 11.2% of the infections were caused by C.amycolatum. All the corynebacteria were multidrug resistant, and 51.8% of isolates were sensitive to only gatifloxacin and vancomycin [9]. In another study by Reddy et al., it was demonstrated that these organisms were resistant to penicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin but susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline [2]. In the 12 cases, we found resistance to ceftriaxone in 66.7% and to imipenem in 33.3% cases. Hence, it is important that an antimicrobial susceptibility testing be performed on each isolate to determine the treatment modality in case of infection with these organisms."}]}]},{"species":"Moraxella lacunata","docs":[{"title":"Eculizumab-Associated Moraxella lacunata Bacteremia and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome in a Toddler with Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Moraxella lacunata is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"4-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":36,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Moraxella lacunata?","id":"4-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"coccobacillus","answer_start":50,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Moraxella lacunata cause?","id":"4-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"conjunctivitis and upper respiratory tract infections","answer_start":96,"id":1},{"text":"bloodstream infection","answer_start":477,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Moraxella lacunata, a low-virulence Gram-negative coccobacillus, is classically associated with conjunctivitis and upper respiratory tract infections; systemic infections such as sepsis have rarely been reported, especially in children.

Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is characterized by dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway with excess production of the terminal complement complex C5b-9, leading to endothelial cell injury and thrombotic microangiopathy.7 Eculizumab, a humanized chimeric anti-C5 monoclonal IgG-kappa immunoglobulin with a hybrid IgG2 and IgG4 Fc component, significantly reduces complement activation.8 It has been shown to significantly reduce mortality and morbidity in aHUS.9 Eculizumab is currently indicated in the United States for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, aHUS, adults with generalized myasthenia gravis who are anti-acetylcholine receptor positive, and adults with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder who are anti-aquaphorin-4 antibody positive.

The bacterium infrequently causes invasive or systemic disease, with just over 20 cases in adults reported in the medical literature. Of 5 children previously reported with invasive Moraxella lacunata infections, 4 had bacteremia and in 1 the organism was recovered from a patellar osteolytic lesion.3-6,15 Of the 4 children with bacteremia, 2 had cardiac anomalies and developed infective endocarditis, 1 was previously well but developed meningitis, and the fourth was healthy but developed acute glomerulonephritis (Table 1). One child with infective endocarditis developed aortic valve vegetation while the other had mitral valve insufficiency. Like the toddler described in this report, the infant with meningitis and the 12-year-old with acute glomerulonephritis recovered without complications. Several of the adults with invasive Moraxella lacunata infections were immunocompromised, but none were among children until this report.13,16 Eculizumab binds with high affinity and specificity to C5, inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b. It thus blocks the terminal complement cascade, without affecting the generation of C3b which is needed for opsonophagocytosis and shaping adaptive immune responses.6,7 C5a is needed for upregulation of phagocytosis.17 C5b binds to damaged or foreign surfaces which leads to the joining of C5b to C6-C9, thereby forming the membrane attack complex whose function is to form transmembrane channels that disrupt the cell membranes of target cells leading to their lysis and death. Inhibition of C5 cleavage thus protects the kidney in aHUS but at the cost of diminished capacity to protect against invading bacteria. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that the presence of eculizumab in the blood of vaccinated adults resulted in inhibition of killing of meningococci despite the deposition of serotype-specific IgG and C3b on the surfaces of bacteria.17,18 Moraxella lacunata bacteremia, independent of eculizumab use, was noted to be associated with transient decreased concentrations of C3 and CH50 in a previously healthy 12-year-old boy with acute glomerulonephritis.6 The increased risk of invasive meningococcal infections resulted in the recommendation for universal immunization against these bacteria for eculizumab recipients. However, a survey of 10 selected jurisdictions in the United States between 2008 and 2016 identified 16 invasive meningococcal infections (including 6 with meningitis) among those treated with eculizumab, most of whom were immunized. The youngest was 16 years old, and the median age was 30 years. Non-groupable Neisseria meningitidis accounted for 11 (73%) of 15 that could be further characterized.10 Other reports described serious infections caused by other species of Neisseria (eg, Neisseria cineria), gonocococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Aspergillus niger, and Cryptococcus neoformans.11 Eculizumab recipients are therefore at risk for infection with a myriad of pathogens. Amoxicillin prophylaxis for 2 weeks is recommended for those who receive eculizumab \u2a7d2 weeks from meningococcal vaccine administration, although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has suggested antimicrobial prophylaxis for the duration of eculizumab therapy.10,12 The efficacy and safety of this approach has not been studied. Limited data suggest that eculizumab-treated individuals on antibiotic prophylaxis fared better than those not on antibiotics in terms of longer duration to their first episode of invasive meningococcal disease and no associated mortality. However, intermediate penicillin susceptibility and even resistance was considerably more common among those taking penicillin or amoxicillin prophylaxis.10,12 We did not resume antimicrobial prophylaxis on this child, and she remained free of invasive bacterial infections for >2 years now."},{"qas":[{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Moraxella lacunata?","id":"4-1-4-1","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":316,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Moraxella lacunata cause?","id":"4-1-4-2","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia and SIRS","answer_start":445,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Eculizumab recipients are at higher of invasive infections by a broad spectrum of bacteria, including some of low virulence.

Further studies to evaluate the source of her persistent bacteremia were performed; an echocardiogram showed a small pericardial effusion with no evidence of endocarditis, and bilateral knee arthrocentesis revealed M. lacunata growth from left knee synovial fluid (Table \u200b(Table2)2) .

M. lacunata is a gram-negative rod of usually low virulence that has most commonly been associated with eye infections and, occasionally, upper respiratory tract infections. We report a case of noniatrogenic M. lacunata bacteremia and septic knee arthritis in a patient with biopsy-proven WHO class III-IV lupus nephritis. Although there have been prior cases of septic arthritis associated with organisms of the Moraxella genus, this is the second case of invasive M. lacunata infection secondary to septic arthritis to be reported worldwide. The first reported case of septic arthritis associated with M. lacunata occurred in a 78-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus infection (11). A review of prior reports suggests a possible association between Moraxella infection and renally compromised hosts; at the time of infection, one patient was undergoing hemodialysis (2), another had nephrotic syndrome (3), and another had diabetic nephropathy (8). Similarly, our patient had lupus nephritis requiring hemodialysis when she was diagnosed with M. lacunata septic arthritis. Chronic renal failure and hemodialysis impair the normal response of the immune system through several mechanisms: by impairing granulocyte locomotion, phagocytosis, and intracellular killing; by depressing cell-mediated immunity; and by activating the alternate complement pathway during hemodialysis (1, 7, 9). In addition to renal compromise, other comorbidities associated with M. lacunata invasive infection include steroid use, preexisting infection with human immunodeficiency virus, and the presence of prosthetic valves (1, 8). However, there have been reports of M. lacunata endocarditis in immunocompetent hosts with native heart valves as well, suggesting that, independent of the immune status of the host, M. lacunata may be a more invasive pathogen than previously recognized (4, 5, 6). Further, it appears that Moraxella species may have a predilection for bone and joint involvement. Moraxella species including Kingella kingae (previously known as M. kingii) and M. osloensis have been isolated from nonimmunocompromised patients and children with osteoarticular infections (2, 10, 13). Prior studies with respiratory tissues have shown M. catarrhalis invasion to be dependent on a trigger-like uptake mechanism involving macropinocytosis, leading to lamellipodium formation and engulfment of the invading organism into macropinosomes (12). However, it is unclear at this time whether a similar mechanism may be involved in Moraxella's propensity for bone and joint invasion. While the roles of the immune status of the host and the presence of renal failure in facilitating invasion necessitate further study, the case reported herein and the literature review suggest that M. lacunata, traditionally viewed as an ophthalmic and respiratory tract pathogen, should not be overlooked in its potential for bone, joint, and endocardial invasion."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whether M. lacunata is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"4-2-3-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-negative","answer_start":2935,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can M. lacunata cause?","id":"4-2-3-2","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia and septic knee arthritis","answer_start":3138,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of M. lacunata?","id":"4-2-3-3","answers":[{"text":"rod","answer_start":2949,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"On 5 December 2008, a 24-year-old woman with lupus nephritis presented at her routine nephrology appointment with a 1-week history of increasing edema, arthralgia, and intermittent fevers.

A nationwide surveillance study of uncomplicated UTI reported that S. saprophyticus (5.2%) was the second most common uropathogen in the total population, and significantly more common in premenopausal females [5]. Similarly, another study reported that the most common uropathogens were E. coli (53.3%) and S. saprophyticus (2.5%) among 4,734 females with uncomplicated UTI in multi-community centers [6]. A Korean study of 24,277 urinary specimen strains from 1996 to 2008 showed that the most common pathogen was E. coli (23.8%), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (11.0%), Enterococcus faecium (10.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.0%), coagulase negative staphylococci (7.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (3.3%), S. saprophyticus (0.1%) [4]. Contrary to previous foreign studies, the isolation of S. saprophyticus was much less frequent from UTI patients in Korea. Because S. saprophyticus is a pathogen of uncomplicated UTI in young women, the isolation rate of the S. saprophyticus may be lower in admitted patients. Therefore, relatively few patients with S. saprophyticus UTI may be included because reports on surveillance for UTI pathogens were performed at tertiary hospitals in Korea [2,3,4]. In a case series of patients with S. saprophyticus bacteremia, there have been no reports of S. saprophyticus bacteremia originating from UTI in Korea to date, and most bacteremias were associated with tunneled-central venous catheters in patients with immune suppression, such as hematologic malignancies [3]. As shown in Table 1 [7,8,9,10,11], three patients had S. saprophyticus bacteremia from UTIs combined with nephrolithiasis, and four patients were healthy young females with a history of intense sexual activity prior to admission. Two patients had pregnancy as a clinical setting. All of these patients were successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics. We speculate why S. saprophyticus bacteremia was rare, although UTI caused by S. saprophyticus was common. First, S. saprophyticus did not produce coagulase, unlike other staphylococci such as S. aureus. Coagulase converts fibrinogen to fibrin and reacts with prothrombin in blood. This reaction results in blood clotting, coating the bacterial cell surface with fibrin and enabling the staphylococci to resist phagocytosis. In this sense, it is proposed that S. saprophyticus has lower virulence than S. aureus, especially in blood. Second, S. saprophyticus did not possess a potassium acquisition system such as ATPase, which is necessary for bacterial growth [12]. A potassium-plentiful environment such as urine enables S. saprophyticus growth without a potassium-import system [12], whereas S. saprophyticus has difficulty of bacterial growth in environments of relatively low potassium concentration such as blood. Third, S. saprophyticus has cell wall-anchoring adhesins to the urinary tract epithelium as a virulence factor, but do not possess the extracellular matrix-binding proteins that are found in S. aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis and enable S. aureus or S. epidermidis to anchor to the peptidoglycan of extracellular matrix [12]. In this report, the patient had an obstructing stone on her left renal pelvis with hydroureteronephrosis. We postulated that urinary tract obstruction by a renal stone enabled S. saprophyticus to reach the renal pelvis easily, and aggravated the tissue invasiveness of bacteria from the urinary tract. Although S. saprophyticus bacteremia from UTI was rare, obstructive nephrolithiasis seems to be a predisposing factor for bacteremia from UTI [9]. Pregnancy can also play a role in functional obstruction and impedance of the descending flow of urine [13]. This case is the first report of S. saprophyticus bacteremia from UTI in Korea. We suggest that S. saprophyticus UTI may result in bacteremia in patients with nephrolithiasis or any cause of obstruction. Thus, S. saprophyticus may cause invasive infection and should be considered when this microbe is isolated from blood cultures in patients with UTI, especially in patients with urinary tract obstruction due to urinary stones or pregnancy."}]},{"title":"Staphylococcus Saprophyticus","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Staphylococcus saprophyticus is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"6-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-positive","answer_start":35,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does S. saprophyticus normally exist?","id":"6-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"perineum, rectum, urethra, cervix, and gastrointestinal tract","answer_start":1046,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Staphylococcus saprophyticus cause?","id":"6-2-1-3","answers":[{"text":"uncomplicated urinary tract infections","answer_start":117,"id":1},{"text":"acute pyelonephritis, urethritis, epididymitis, and prostatitis","answer_start":272,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Staphylococcus saprophyticus?","id":"6-2-1-4","answers":[{"text":"non-hemolytic coccus","answer_start":70,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a Gram-positive, coagulase-negative, non-hemolytic coccus that is a common cause of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), particularly in young sexually active females.

A complicated infection typically involves a patient that is immunocompromised, elderly, male, pregnant, diabetic, and\/or with urologic abnormalities such as indwelling catheters or kidney disease.   S. saprophyticus can be differentiated from another coagulase-negative staphylococcus by its resistance to Novobiocin. Like other uropathogens, S. saprophyticus utilizes urease to produce ammonia. However, unlike many of these organisms, it cannot reduce nitrate.   S. saprophyticus is part of the normal human flora that colonizes the perineum, rectum, urethra, cervix, and gastrointestinal tract.

Common human isolates are Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus caprae, Staphylococcus saccharolyticus, Staphylococcus pasteuri, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus lugdunensis [1].  S. simulans commonly affects cows, sheep, goats, and horses. Human infections are rare, and the literature has commonly reported soft tissue infection, osteomyelitis, bacteremia, urinary tract infection, prosthetic joint infection, and native valve endocarditis [1\u20138] (Table 1). A case of pneumonia was reported by de Jesus et al. which revealed S. simulans in blood culture and CoNS in sputum culture [2]. de Jesus et al. also reported a case of acute respiratory failure, ARDS with blood culture growing S. simulans [2]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of pleural empyema caused by S. simulans. In our patient, there was no history of contact with animals. Mode of acquisition of infection in our patient remained unclear.  S. simulans tends to cause more severe infection because of a biofilm layer which helps in adherence and colonization of smooth surfaces, especially prosthetic devices, shunts, and catheters [8]. S. simulans has also been shown to share virulence factors with S. aureus in infectious animal isolates, including staphylococcal enterotoxins, tissue necrosis cytotoxin Panton\u2013Valentine leukocidin, and the methicillin-resistance gene, mecA [5]. The encapsulated forms of S. simulans (i.e., slime layer or biofilm) have an antiphagocytic effect on human polymorphonuclear leucocytes as compared to unencapsulated forms of the pathogen [8]. Sequencing of the tuf gene has been shown to be the most accurate for the species identification of CoNS [9]. The critical event in the establishing the pathogenicity includes formation of multilayered biofilm, especially in foreign body-associated infections caused by CoNS. Members of the genus Staphylococcus produce various proteinaceous and nonproteinaceous adhesins, to mediate attachment to host surfaces, such as plasma extracellular and matrix proteins or even host cells [10, 11]. There are limited data available about how CoNS which are usually common pathogens in veterinary medicine are gaining pathogenicity in human hosts. There are some shared virulence factors with Staphylococcus aureus which are documented in Table 2 [5, 12\u201314]. Of note, mecA-positive CoNS are capable to horizontally transfer their genes inside the staphylococcal genus with the prospective to contribute increase in new methicillin-resistant strains [12]. The challenging problem even after CoNS isolation and identification is the assessment of their clinical relevance. The major diagnostic question remains as to whether the CoNS isolate represents a contamination of the specimen, physiological colonization of the skin or mucus membranes, or a clinically significant infection. In our case, the absence of other microbiological data and the confidence in the sterile process of procuring the sample from pleural fluid warranted consideration of S. simulans in the pleural fluid as pathogenic. Important considerations include isolation of a strain in pure culture from the site of infection and repeated isolation of the same strain over the course of infection [11, 15]. While treating the pleural infections, clinicians need to be cognizant of the choice of antimicrobial therapy and relevant pharmacokinetics. Major factors that inhibit the penetration of antibiotics is the large-sized effusions\/empyema, thickness of pleura, and the nature of antibiotic itself; acute inflammation is proven to be a supporting factor due to vasodilation [16, 17]. Teixeira et al. demonstrated that penicillin has the best penetration for the treatment of pleural pathologies, followed by metronidazole; gentamicin was found to have poor penetration and considered a poor choice for treatment of empyemas [16].  S. simulans is known to demonstrate resistance to multiple antibiotics including vancomycin [2]. In our case, the organism was resistant to ampicillin\/sulbactam, cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, oxacillin, and tetracycline, but it was susceptible to vancomycin in vitro. The use of vancomycin in pleural infections has long been debated due to its suboptimal penetration; however, in our case, the multidrug-resistant nature of the isolate required its use. It is debatable in retrospect if continuation of a broader antimicrobial coverage would have changed the outcome for the patient, considering poor biochemical and clinical response with the chosen antibiotic regimen. Source control for septic patients remains the cornerstone of treatment along with optimal antimicrobial coverage. The MIST-2 study reiterated the fact where use of t-PA and DNase combination therapy in patients with pleural infection improved drainage of pleural empyema, resulting in reduction in hospital stay and need for thoracic surgery intervention [18]."}]},{"title":"Vertebral osteomyelitis and native valve endocarditis due to Staphylococcus simulans: a case report","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Staphylococcus simulans normally exist?","id":"7-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"human skin","answer_start":83,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Staphylococcus simulans cause?","id":"7-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"vertebral osteomyelitis and endocarditis","answer_start":254,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Staphylococcus simulans is a common animal pathogen that occasionally can colonize human skin.

Anecdotal reports have associated S. simulans with bacteremia, native valve endocarditis, post-surgical pubic osteomyelitis, prosthetic joint infection and urinary tract infection [7-11]. The scarcity of reported human infections caused by S. simulans is probably due to the infrequent colonization of human skin by this microorganism as well as the failure of many microbiology laboratories to routinely identify coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level. Unlike other coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. simulans together with S. lugdunensis are more virulent and tend to cause infections that resemble those caused by S. aureus [12,13]. Indeed, our patient presented with high fever and native valve endocarditis. There was no history of mitral valve predisposition to endocarditis (for example, mitral valve prolapse). This case is supportive of the observation that infections due to S. simulans are reminiscent of those caused by S. aureus rather than those caused by most coagulase-negative staphylococci. The portal of entry of S. simulans in this patient remains speculative. Given his profession (butcher), colonization by S. simulans may have taken place while working with cattle or sheep.

The predominant sources, routes of infection, and clinical manifestations of human infections greatly vary according to the geographic area considered. Moreover, clinical suspicion of tularemia is often tricky because of the lack of specificity of the clinical manifestations. Because F. tularensis isolation is tedious and detection of its DNA usually requires removal of infected tissues, serological techniques are most often used for diagnostic confirmation. However, these techniques are varied and poorly standardized. The microagglutination test (MAT), the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and ELISA tests are currently the most frequently used techniques. These home-made and commercial tests are mainly used for tularemia diagnosis but also seroprevalence studies. ELISA tests detect specific antibodies within two weeks of disease evaluation, compared to 2\u20133 weeks for MAT and IFA. However, more false-positive results are usually reported with ELISA. The long-term persistence of anti-F. tularensis antibodies in patients with past tularemia infection hampers the diagnostic specificity of all these tests. Also, cross-reacting antibodies have been described (especially with Brucella and Yersinia species), although usually at a low level. The immunoblotting technique can highlight these serological cross-reactions.

F. tularensis subsp. tularensis (type A) is mainly restricted to North America, although a few strains have been isolated in Slovakia and Austria (Gurycov\u00e1, 1998). F. tularensis subsp. holarctica (type B) is spread throughout the Northern hemisphere but has recently been isolated in Australia (Aravena-Rom\u00e1n et al., 2015). Modern classification schemes based on whole-genome sequencing have defined clades and sub-clades (Vogler et al., 2009). Type A strains include four main clades: A1a and A1b (mainly in the central and eastern USA), and A2a and A2b (mainly in the western USA). Type B strains include four main clades: B.4 (mainly North America, but also Scandinavia), B.6 (Western Europe and North America), B.12 (Eastern Europe and Asia), and B.16 (mainly Japan, but also in Turkey, China, and Australia). F. tularensis is classified as a category A potential biothreat agent by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control, USA) (Oyston et al., 2004; Maurin, 2015). A1b strains are considered the most virulent (Kugeler et al., 2009). Human tularemia cases usually occur through contact with wild animals (especially hares and small rodents), arthropod bites (mainly Ixodidae ticks, and mosquitoes in Sweden and Finland), and the contaminated hydro-telluric environment (Sj\u00f6stedt, 2007; Maurin and Gyuranecz, 2016). Infection may occur through the skin (e.g., contact with animals and arthropod bites), the conjunctiva (e.g., finger-to-eye contamination), the oral route (e.g., ingestion of contaminated food or water), or the respiratory tract (e.g., inhalation of a contaminated aerosol). After a short incubation period (3\u20135 days on average, up to 2 weeks), patients usually suffer from flu-like symptoms. Depending on the route of infection, the disease may then evolve to one of the six classical clinical forms (Evans et al., 1985; Maurin and Gyuranecz, 2016). These include the ulceroglandular and glandular forms (regional lymphadenopathy with or without a skin inoculation lesion, respectively), the oculoglandular form (a conjunctivitis with cervical or pretragial lymphadenopathy), the oropharyngeal form (a pharyngitis with cervical lymphadenopathy), the pneumonic form (acute or subacute pneumonia), and the typhoidal form (severe sepsis with confusion). Many complications may occur in tularemia patients, the most common being lymph node suppuration (up to 30% of patients with regional lymphadenopathy), and less frequently meningitis and meningoencephalitis, heart infection, bone, and soft tissue infections, etc. (Evans et al., 1985; Khoury et al., 2005; Ata et al., 2013; Maurin and Gyuranecz, 2016; Rawal et al., 2017). The global death rate of tularemia is currently low (<1% in Eurasia, 2\u20133% in North America), but it may be much higher when A1b strains are involved (24% in (Kugeler et al., 2009)). Tularemia diagnosis is often delayed due to late consultation of patients who suffer from mild symptoms and late clinical suspicion of tularemia by physicians because of poor specificity of clinical symptoms (P\u00e9rez-Castrill\u00f3n et al., 2001; T\u00e4rnvik and Berglund, 2003; Maurin et al., 2011; Gozel et al., 2014). The isolation of F. tularensis from clinical samples is tedious and usually obtained in less than 10% of patients (Helvaci et al., 2000; P\u00e9rez-Castrill\u00f3n et al., 2001; T\u00e4rnvik and Chu, 2007; Hepburn and Simpson, 2008; Larssen et al., 2011; Maurin et al., 2011). The bacterium may be isolated from blood cultures in patients with F. tularensis bacteremia or less frequently from other clinical samples, including skin ulcers, conjunctival or pharyngeal exudates, lymph node biopsies or suppurations, sputum samples, and cerebrospinal fluid. PCR-based methods are useful in localized forms of tularemia when exudates or tissue samples can be obtained. PCR tests may allow confirmation of tularemia at an early stage of the disease (e.g., acute pneumonia, oculoglandular or oropharyngeal forms) or late diagnostic confirmation (e.g., by testing surgically-removed suppurated lymph nodes) (T\u00e4rnvik and Chu, 2007; Hepburn and Simpson, 2008; Maurin and Gyuranecz, 2016). Due to limitations of the culture and PCR methods, tularemia diagnosis primarily relies on serological tests (T\u00e4rnvik and Chu, 2007; Hepburn and Simpson, 2008; Maurin and Gyuranecz, 2016). The purpose of the present review is to summarize the literature concerning the development and use of tularemia serological methods and to point out the shortcomings and possible improvements in this field."}]}]},{"species":"Yersinia pestis","docs":[{"title":"Yersinia pestis and plague: an updated view on evolution, virulence determinants, immune subversion, vaccination, and diagnostics","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Yersinia pestis cause?","id":"9-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Plague","answer_start":0,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Plague is a vector-borne disease caused by Yersinia pestis.

The etiological agent of plague is the Gram-negative bacterium Yersinia pestis [2], discovered by the Institut Pasteur, bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin during a plague outbreak in Hong Kong in 1894 [3]. Plague has impacted the history of humankind through several pandemics that have initially spread from Central Asia to Africa and Europe, and plague has reached every continent during the last 150 years [4]. In the 21st century, plague is present in Asia, Africa and America [5], and recent outbreaks in Uganda [6], China [7], Democratic Republic of Congo [8], and Madagascar [9, 10] remind that plague is still a major public health concern. Y. pestis is highly similar on a genomic level to the enteric pathogen Y. pseudotuberculosis; however, a series of gene gain and gene loss events have led to the appearance of markedly different mechanisms of disease as well as niche preference and lifestyle [11]. Y. pestis displays a quite unique set of virulence factors that allow successful infection of fleas and subversion of immune responses in mammalian hosts, leading to rapid host death in the absence of adequate treatment. In this article, we review recent advances in plague research, particularly in the fields of evolution, virulence determinants, and subversion of mammalian immune responses, as well as an overview of the critical aspects of vaccination and pneumonic plague diagnosis.

Its persistence in the environment relies on the subtle balance between Y. pestis-contaminated soils, burrowing and nonburrowing mammals exhibiting variable degrees of plague susceptibility, and their associated fleas. Transmission from one host to another relies mainly on infected flea bites, inducing typical painful, enlarged lymph nodes referred to as buboes, followed by septicemic dissemination of the pathogen. In contrast, droplet inhalation after close contact with infected mammals induces primary pneumonic plague. Finally, the rarely reported consumption of contaminated raw meat causes pharyngeal and gastrointestinal plague. Point-of-care diagnosis, early antibiotic treatment, and confinement measures contribute to outbreak control despite residual mortality. Mandatory primary prevention relies on the active surveillance of established plague foci and ectoparasite control. Plague is acknowledged to have infected human populations for at least 5,000 years in Eurasia. Y. pestis genomes recovered from affected archaeological sites have suggested clonal evolution from a common ancestor shared with the closely related enteric pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and have indicated that ymt gene acquisition during the Bronze Age conferred Y. pestis with ectoparasite transmissibility while maintaining its enteric transmissibility. Three historic pandemics, starting in 541 AD and continuing until today, have been described. At present, the third pandemic has become largely quiescent, with hundreds of human cases being reported mainly in a few impoverished African countries, where zoonotic plague is mostly transmitted to people by rodent-associated flea bites."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Yersinia pestis cause?","id":"9-2-2-1","answers":[{"text":"plague","answer_start":0,"id":1},{"text":"five principal forms of plague, including bubonic, septicemic, pneumonic, meningeal, and pharyngeal plague","answer_start":937,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Plague, caused by the bacterial pathogen Yersinia pestis, has been recognized by doctors and populations as a unique nosological entity for centuries because it is the sole disease characterized by swollen lymph nodes referred to as buboes to cause deadly epidemics. Historical sources in Europe have led to the delineation of three plague pandemics. The first pandemic, known as the Justinian Plague, devastated the Mediterranean Basin from 541 to 750\/767 CE (1) and invaded northern Europe as far as Germany and England (2). The second pandemic, lasting from 1346 to the 18th century, including the so-called \u201cBlack Death\u201d period of 1346 to 1353 (3), killed an estimated one-third of the European population (4). The third pandemic probably began in 1772 in the Chinese province of Yunnan (5, 6) and spread worldwide on the eve of the 20th century following human movement via steamship and railroad (7). Y. pestis infection may cause five principal forms of plague, including bubonic, septicemic, pneumonic, meningeal, and pharyngeal plague (8). In addition, Y. pestis may cause skin ulceration at its portal of entry, reported as carbuncles and ulcers, along with pustules, spots, petechiae, bruising, and gangrene (9). The plague etiology was resolved in 1894 in Hong Kong by the Swiss-French physician Alexandre Yersin, who was affiliated with the Pasteur Institute and who also contributed to resolving part of the cycle of transmission of Y. pestis involving the rat (Rattus rattus) and its ectoparasites (Xenopsylla cheopis) (10). Obtaining a comprehensive overview of various sources of infection and various routes of transmission of Y. pestis in populations is critical for preventing and surveying plague. Cumulative field observations in plague foci combined with the critical review of data issuing from paleomicrobiological, anthropological, and historical studies continue to shed new light on questions related to the reservoirs, sources, transmission, and vectors of Y. pestis and to provide new avenues for addressing these questions. Here, we critically review data reported in the English literature and some non-English publications to provide a comprehensive view of the various cycles of plague transmission as a basis for determining the appropriate medical management of plague in the countries in which it remains a zoonotic disease and a public health concern."},{"qas":[{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Yersinia pestis?","id":"9-2-3-1","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic human pathogens","answer_start":53,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Y. pestis is among the oldest reported and deadliest opportunistic human pathogens. During the Neolithic period at least, plague raged across Eurasia, causing outbreaks and possibly leading to a temporary decline in centenarian cultures. Approximately 3,800 years ago, Y. pestis acquired the ymt gene, enabling it to become a more efficient flea-borne bacterium. The Justinian Plague (541 to 750\/767) remains controversial as to its demographic, political, and social consequences, unlike the second pandemic (1346 to 18th century), which killed at least 30% of the European population, made a profound impression on the collective imagination, and led to a deep restructuring of medieval society. The mortality rates resulting from the current third pandemic (1772 to present) have been incredibly low (except at its beginning) due to the first treatments and the use of antibiotics, which made it possible to reduce the mortality rate from 50 to 100% in the absence of treatment to approximately 10 to 25%. The most recent study indicates that Y. pestis is a telluric bacterium that exists in a free state, an L-form, or inside amoeba, and soil could serve as a reservoir. More than 200 mammals (mainly rodents) have been found to be infected by plague, probably orally, resulting from digging in soil. Human contamination from wild sources may occur from flea and tick bites, transcutaneous contact, aerosol inhalation, or oral ingestion (raw meat consumption). The most recent evidence indicates that interhuman transmission may be due mainly to human ectoparasites, such as body lice and fleas (aerosol transmission appears to be very low). The current data indicate that the epidemiology of plague is extremely complex because it is intrinsically linked to a given environment and time. For example, rats and fleas were found to be effective vectors in 1898 in India, but this scheme cannot be applied to effective reservoirs and vectors in ancient and modern plague outbreaks. The plague in the United States seems to be linked mainly to squirrels or chipmunks. In North Africa and the Middle East, outbreaks are linked to the consumption of raw or poorly cooked meat from camels or goats, and Tibetan cases are linked to sheep and marmot skinning. In regions where plague is endemic, efforts have been made to prevent human cases by performing \u201csentinel\u201d animal surveys and vaccination. In addition, to support the appropriate management of patients and provide a rapid and accurate microbiological diagnosis, we recommend evaluation in point-of-care laboratories, some of which are currently operating in a few remote regions in Africa. In addition to the direct diagnosis of disease in humans, the direct detection of Y. pestis at the point of care among potential sources and vectors could facilitate our understanding of how plague epidemics are sustained."}]}]},{"species":"Pasteurella multocida","docs":[{"title":"Pasteurella multocida line infection: a case report and review of literature","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Pasteurella multocida cause?","id":"10-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":365,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"There are as many as 300,000 visits to the emergency department in the USA with animal bites every year.

Infection can result in a number of complications including necrotising fasciitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis and less commonly septic shock, endocarditis and meningitis. The bacteria have several potential virulence factors including capsular lipopolysaccharide, a cytotoxin, hemagglutin, adhesins and iron acquisition proteins [3]. More severe disease has been documented in infants, pregnant women, patients on steroids, people living with HIV and immunocompromised patients [4]. In general, the organism is very sensitive to penicillin though some \u03b2-lactamase-producing isolates have been reported and empiric treatment is recommended with \u03b2\u2013lactam\/\u03b2\u2013lactamase combinations such as ampicillin\/sulbactam or amoxicillin\/clavulanic [5]. Alternatives that have shown good activity against P multocida include second and third generation cephalosporins, tetracyclines, co-trimoxazole and fluoroquinolones. Infection of prosthetic material with P. multocida following animal bites or licks is rare but has been described for prosthetic joints, aortic endografts and peritoneal catheters [6\u20138]. One retrospective study in France identified six P. multocida cases among 4686 prosthetic joint infections. All patients underwent surgery with prosthesis retention in three. Long-term antibiotics were used for all patients (range 6\u201318 months) without relapse at least 3 years after end of treatment [6]. The authors reviewed the literature identifying an additional 26 cases of P. multocida prosthetic joint infection. About half of these were treated with prosthesis retention (with or without debridement) with only four requiring subsequent prosthesis removal and staged replacement. An earlier study described aortic endovascular graft infection following rabbit bite and reviewed another two cases of endograft infection. The authors concluded in these cases that operative management is optimal with removal of infected material [7]. Perhaps most relevant to our case is a study of P. multocida peritonitis associated with peritoneal dialysis catheters [8]. The study reviewed seven local cases and 30 previously published reports with the authors concluding that although most patients were treated with catheter retention (89%), relapse occurred in only one patient. Despite significant heterogeneity in treatment the authors suggested that a 14-day course of intraperitoneal antibiotics was most likely adequate. They recommended use of penicillin or ampicillin-based regimens for non-\u03b2-lactamase producing isolates. Alternatives included third generation cephalosporins, ceftazidime and oral fluoroquinolones. One of three patients treated with intraperitoneal aminoglycosides had recurrence of infection thus the authors recommend against monotherapy with aminoglycosides. In our patient, the infection route was via direct inoculation and line replacement was performed for punctured tubing. Bacteraemia ensued but was successfully treated without relapse, despite line retention, with a 14-day course of susceptible antibiotics intravenously and with catheter locks. Our case suggests that in cases of P. multocida infection with bacteremia, individuals can be considered for a trial of treatment with IV antibiotics, catheter locks and line retention. This is supported by the literature of successful treatment with prosthesis retention for prosthetic joint infections and peritoneal catheter associated infections. Given the discussed evidence for treatment failure of intraperitoneal aminoglycosides, the authors recommend catheter lock with either ampicillin or a cephalosporin such as ceftazidime depending on isolate sensitivities. In the case of purulent line infection, we believe it would be prudent to advocate for line replacement as recommended in Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines [2]. To our knowledge this is the first description of a line associated Pasteurella multocida infection and provides management guidance for clinicians managing similar infections. Clearly recommendations are limited by the paucity of evidence; however, we believe that such infections are likely more common than reported in the literature and clinicians will benefit from our experience."}]},{"title":"Pasteurella multocida: Genotypes and Genomics","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Pasteurella multocida is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"10-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":866,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Pasteurella multocida cause?","id":"10-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"chronic pulmonary infection","answer_start":3364,"id":1},{"text":"urinary tract infection","answer_start":3570,"id":2},{"text":"bacteremic meningitis","answer_start":3607,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Pasteurella multocida?","id":"10-2-1-3","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":572,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Pasteurella multocida's requirement for oxygen?","id":"10-2-1-4","answers":[{"text":"facultatively anaerobic","answer_start":841,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Pasteurella multocida?","id":"10-2-1-5","answers":[{"text":"coccobacillus","answer_start":880,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Pasteurella multocida normally exist?","id":"10-2-1-6","answers":[{"text":"normal oropharyngeal microbiota of many animals","answer_start":485,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"The genus Pasteurella was named in honor of the famous French microbiologist and chemist Louis Pasteur, who first isolated this bacterium in the 1880s as the causative agent of \u201cchol\u00e9ra des poules\u201d (fowl cholera) (1). Since that time, Pasteurella species have been linked as causative agents of many infectious diseases in a wide range of animals as well as in humans (reviewed in references 2 and 3). Like most Pasteurella species, Pasteurella multocida is often found as part of the normal oropharyngeal microbiota of many animals and birds but can also be a primary or opportunistic pathogen of the upper and lower respiratory tracts (described in reference 4). Three subspecies of P. multocida were formally recognized in 1985, P. multocida subsp. multocida, subsp. gallicida, and subsp. septica (5). P. multocida is a small, nonmotile, facultatively anaerobic, Gram-negative coccobacillus, measuring approximately 0.3 to 1.0 \u03bcm in width and 1.0 to 2.0 \u03bcm in length (described in references 4 and 6). Typical bipolar staining with methylene blue can be seen in smears taken from wounds or tissues. P. multocida strains can be cultured on rich medium, such as tryptic soy agar, chocolate agar, or brain heart infusion agar, supplemented with 5 to 10% fetal calf serum or horse or sheep blood, under aerobic conditions at 37\u00b0C; they are oxidase and catalase positive; and they can ferment many carbohydrates, such as fructose, glucose, mannose, and galactose, to produce acid but not gas (described in references 4 and 7). Biochemical tests can be used for preliminary differentiation of P. multocida subspecies, where P. multocida subsp. multocida isolates are generally dulcitol negative and sorbitol positive, P. multocida subsp. gallicida isolates are generally dulcitol positive and sorbitol negative, and P. multocida subsp. septica isolates are generally dulcitol negative and sorbitol negative (8). Molecular techniques such as ribotyping based on sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence PCR (REP-PCR), and\/or multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analyses can more easily and accurately differentiate subspecies of P. multocida (9). For example, using ribotyping, a putative novel subspecies, designated P. multocida subsp. tigris, was identified from a human infection resulting from a tiger bite wound (10). More recently, MLST analysis further differentiated isolates from wild chimpanzees that displayed conflicting fermentation patterns such that they could not be assigned to P. multocida subsp. gallicida or subsp. septica; the MLST analysis revealed that the isolates were more closely related to P. multocida subsp. gallicida (11). P. multocida is capable of infecting a wide spectrum of domestic and wild mammals, birds, and reptiles as well as humans (reviewed in reference 3). The most common P. multocida-associated diseases of economic importance to global animal husbandry are fowl cholera in avian species, hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) and bovine respiratory disease in ruminant species, progressive atrophic rhinitis and pneumonic pasteurellosis in swine, and snuffles in rabbits (described in reference 2). In humans, opportunistic infections resulting from bite or scratch wounds are relatively common, especially in elderly and immunocompromised individuals (described in reference 2), although chronic pulmonary infection in humans can result from exposure to mucous secretions from animals or pets with respiratory colonization or infection (reviewed in reference 3). In addition, clinical cases of urinary tract infection (12, 13) and bacteremic meningitis have been reported (14). Human deaths due to P. multocida infection are uncommon, with reports in the United States ranging from 2 to 25 between 1993 and 2006 (reviewed in reference 3) and even fewer more recently (15). Despite more than 135 years of study, P. multocida remains an enigmatic pathogenic bacterium. Until recently, only incremental progress had been made toward understanding the molecular basis of P. multocida pathogenesis and host disease predilection. However, whole-genome sequences of a number of P. multocida strains have now become available, which enables the application of new approaches to study the underlying genetic mechanisms associated with virulence, fitness, and host specificity of P. multocida (16,\u201323). In this review, we provide a summary of the molecular insights into the genotypes, fitness, and pathogenesis of P. multocida that have been gained from recent whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and comparative analysis studies. We also note areas where gaps in our knowledge remain."}]}]},{"species":"Peptostreptococcus anaerobius","docs":[{"title":"Gram-positive anaerobic cocci","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of drugs are P. anaerobius resistant to?","id":"11-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactam","answer_start":1948,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) are a heterogeneous group of organisms defined by their morphological appearance and their inability to grow in the presence of oxygen; most clinical isolates are identified to species in the genus Peptostreptococcus. GPAC are part of the normal flora of all mucocutaneous surfaces and are often isolated from infections such as deep organ abscesses, obstetric and gynecological sepsis, and intraoral infections. They have been little studied for several reasons, which include an inadequate classification, difficulties with laboratory identification, and the mixed nature of the infections from which they are usually isolated. Nucleic acid studies indicate that the classification is in need of radical revision at the genus level. Several species of Peptostreptococcus have recently been described, but others still await formal recognition. Identification has been based on carbohydrate fermentation tests, but most GPAC are asaccharolytic and use the products of protein degradation for their metabolism; the introduction of commercially available preformed enzyme kits affords a physiologically more appropriate method of identification, which is simple and relatively rapid and can be used in routine diagnostic laboratories. Recent reports have documented the isolation in pure culture of several species, notably Peptostreptococcus magnus, from serious infections. Studies of P. magnus have elucidated several virulence factors which correlate with the site of infection, and reveal some similarities to Staphylococcus aureus. P. micros is a strongly proteolytic species; it is increasingly recognized as an important pathogen in intraoral infections, particularly periodontitis, and mixed anaerobic deep-organ abscesses. Comparison of antibiotic susceptibility patterns reveals major differences between species. Penicillins are the antibiotics of choice, although some strains of P. anaerobius show broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactam resistance."}]}]},{"species":"Xanthomonas fragariae","docs":[{"title":"Transcriptome analysis of Xanthomonas fragariae in strawberry leaves","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Xanthomonas fragariae cause?","id":"12-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"angular leaf spot on strawberry","answer_start":69,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Xanthomonas fragariae is a quarantine bacterial pathogen that causes angular leaf spot on strawberry.

Moreover, the pathogen survives poorly on leaf surfaces, and a significant decrease in the population density in the first 3 days after inoculation was found. This drop in the population can indicate that this pathogen uses a strategy of avoidance to escape environmental stresses and enters the plant leaves to survive. The population gradually rebuilds during later phases of infection, reaching the preparatory stage of the bacteria before the exudation phase at ca. 14 days post inoculation. During disease development, symptoms start from single small spots of water-soaked lesions bounded by leaf vines. With time, the number of angular spots increases, and as observed by electron microscopy techniques, bacterial cells suspended in copious amounts of EPS colonize mesophyll air spaces. In the next steps, plasmolysis of mesophyll cells and disruption of organelles occur, and bacteria ooze from stomates. In our study, we analysed Xf mRNA in planta with RNA-seq 15 days after inoculation, when well-developed water soaking symptoms were observed but strawberry tissue was not necrotized yet. We could assume that the bacterial cell stages and gene expression of the cells that were located in the water-soaked leaf parts and on the border of healthy and already diseased plant tissue were different. The bacterial population may be localized in the intercellular spaces and partially move into the vascular tissue; however, a large part is in degraded tissue. The obtained results of transcriptome analysis are thus an average expression of cells in different steps of interaction with plant tissue. In all experimental combinations, the highest abundance of transcripts was observed for the genes coding membrane proteins OmpA and OmpW, groL (encoding molecular chaperone GroEL), and one gene of a hypothetical protein. The high number of transcripts of the gene coding OmpA can be caused by the fact that it is the most abundant outer membrane (OM) protein in many bacterial species, e.g., OmpA in Escherichia coli is present at 100,000 copies per cell. Although this protein is also found to play a role in the pathogenesis of, e.g., Xanthomonas albilineans, its expression was lower in planta than in Wilbrink\u2019s medium, similar to the groL gene behaviour. Chaperone GroEL is involved in protein folding and cell proliferation\/survival. OmpW is involved in the transport of small hydrophilic molecules across the bacterial outer membrane. Studies in Salmonella typhimurium suggest that this porin may have a role in the protection of bacteria against various forms of environmental stress by operating as an efflux channel for toxic compounds, and in the case of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, OmpW is suspected to be involved in protecting biofilms. The T6SS system is widespread in Gram-negative bacteria and can deliver toxic effector proteins into eukaryotic cells or competing bacteria; it can also participate in uptake of metal ions, such as iron, manganese, and zinc. T6SS effector translocation apparatuses are very similar to an inverted bacteriophage-puncturing device composed of at least 13 proteins identified as core components. In our study, three genes coding for the elements of this translocation apparatus and many coding for T6SS effectors were upregulated in planta, which suggests their importance in relation to host plants; however, the potential role of this system in the pathogenic relation of Xf is unknown. Among the upregulated genes in planta, seven out of 25 eggNOG\/COG categories were over-represented. Although the in planta Xf gene expression was analysed 15 days after strawberry leaf inoculation, the groups of upregulated Xf genes are congruent with those of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) in an in vitro system with rice leaf extract during the first 60 min after contact with the medium. However, taking into account the low virulence of Xf and problems with maintaining a high population in early contact with plants, it is difficult to compare what time since inoculation can be equivalent to the first minutes of contact in the case of Xoo. In Xoo, the most over-represented categories among the differentially expressed genes were inorganic ion transport and metabolism (P) and cell motility (N). Uptake of inorganic ions, such as iron, seems to be crucial for plant pathogenic bacteria that need to compete with their host to obtain nutrients. The key regulator HrpG is a repressor of chemotaxis and flagella biosynthesis-related genes and consequent bacterial motility, which was confirmed in a study on Xoo. In the case of our study, motility, chemotaxis and flagella synthesis genes were all significantly upregulated together with high upregulation of hrpG and other hrp genes, which again can represent the average gene expression of Xf cells in the leaves. Pili are involved in twitching motility and may be involved in the adhesion of Xanthomonas species. The genes coding for the synthesis of pili are downregulated in Xf present in water-soaked lesions, possibly because the process of attachment to the host had already passed. Conversely, the genes for flagella synthesis were upregulated. For X. axonopodis pv. citri, it has been demonstrated that flagella and flagella-dependent motility are important not only for adherence to biotic and abiotic surfaces but also for maturing of the biofilm, symptom development and extension and dispersion of the biofilms, indicating that maturation and extension of the biofilm in the lesions still takes place. The upregulation of chemotaxis and flagella genes may also indicate a preparation for a release and dispersal of the pathogen via moisture from the lesions. Looking at the expression of genes known as important for pathogenicity, out of 12 genes of xanthan synthesis, only four gumBCDE were upregulated, the next four genes in the operon showed no change in expression, and the last four genes were downregulated. In xanthan biosynthesis, the upregulated gumBCE genes are responsible for polymerization and\/or export of the polymer, while the others are mostly responsible for the synthesis, so it seems that at this stage of plant infection, synthesis of xanthan was not relatively intensive. Out of the rpf gene cluster, which is known to be involved in the regulation of pathogenicity factors, an increase in expression was observed only for the rpfA gene. Mutation of this gene resulted in reduced levels of extracellular enzymes and EPS in Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc). Additionally, a possible connection between rpfA and iron metabolism was suggested. Simultaneously, no change or decrease in expression was recorded for two other genes, rpfB and rpfF, which are essential for the synthesis of a small diffusible signal molecule that is involved in the regulation of virulence factor synthesis in response to physiological or environmental changes. Xf has a distinct T3E repertoire comprising multiple rare effectors and several putative new effectors. Of genes annotated T3E or coding for avirulence proteins, only some were upregulated in planta. Among the five genes annotated xopP, only one xopP_1 had higher expression in planta than in pure culture, while four other copies showed no change in expression. XopP was found to be a crucial T3E in X. campestris, conserved among different pathovars of this species and other Xanthomonas species. Its function was recently described as blocking peptidoglycan- and chitin-triggered immunity in rice by inhibiting the U-box ubiquitin ligase OsPUB44. All five copies are located in one region of the genome next to each other. Interestingly, several putative new effectors found by Vandroemme et al. in the Xf genome were differentially expressed in strawberry plants. Effectors of foreign origin (such as XopC1) with the highest homology to proteins in Ralstonia (e.g., XopAD_1, which shows the highest similarity to an unidentified protein in Mesorhizobium) were upregulated in planta, similar to the majority of genes coding putative XopD and showing distant homology to a T3E of Pseudomonas. These results suggest that the foreign origin genes coding for T3E can be functional in Xf during the pathogenesis process. The role of T2SS, used for secretion of degradative enzymes, has not yet been studied in X. fragariae. In other Xanthomonas species, such as X. campestris pv. vesicatoria and X. axonopodis pv. citri, the xps cluster constituting the T2SS has been identified. It is likely that this secretion system also plays a role in Xf, as several genes responsible for the synthesis of degradative enzymes, such as cellulases, proteases, polygalacturonases, lyases, amylases and lipases, were upregulated in planta. During infection of plants, bacteria are exposed to a variety of antimicrobial compounds produced by the host. One of the mechanisms underlying plant resistance to diseases can be related to increased concentrations of toxic pathogen compounds, as is found in apple cultivars resistant to Erwinia amylovora. Multidrug efflux pumps and permeases recognize and efficiently expel a wide range of structurally diverse compounds from the bacterial cell and play a very important role in the success of pathogens. This observation could suggest that the compounds produced by strawberry leaf tissue are not toxic for Xf although they have antimicrobial properties, and therefore, the expression of genes coding for proteins involved in the detoxification of bacterial cells is not increased in planta. Plasmids are the extrachromosomal elements widely spread in plant pathogenic bacteria. The range of plasmid-coded features, including virulence, toxin and hormone production and resistance to bactericides, has been reported in many phytopathogenic bacteria. In the case of Xanthomonas, plasmid biology is still not well understood; however, there are some reports on organisms such as X. campestris pv. malvacearum showing that in cotton, a number of plasmid-borne avr genes together encode the ability to cause watersoaking in the host plant. The role of plasmids in X. fragariae has not been studied at all; however, the presence of a gene coding for T3E on the plasmid and the change in expression of almost half of the plasmid genes in planta suggest its potential importance in the interaction with plants."}]}]},{"species":"Enterobacter hormaechei","docs":[{"title":"First report of Enterobacter hormaechei with respiratory disease in calves","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Enterobacter hormaechei sensitive to?","id":"13-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"quinolones","answer_start":836,"id":1},{"text":"enrofloxacin","answer_start":1205,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Enterobacter hormaechei resistant to?","id":"13-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"all \u03b2-lactam antimicrobials","answer_start":789,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Enterobacter hormaechei is commonly considered a causative pathogen for nosocomial infections and it does not usually cause diseases in animals.

Prior to admission, he had received amoxicillin and then clarithromycin. On physical examination, he presented with a high fever (40\u00b0C), right temporal headache, paralysis of the left arm, and swelling of the submandibular lymph nodes. Laboratory investigations revealed an inflammatory syndrome with a C-reactive protein level measuring 118 mg\/liter and a leukocyte count of 13.3 \u00d7 10 cells\/liter. Standard cerebrospinal fluid analysis as well as aerobic and anaerobic cultures did not reveal any abnormalities. Two aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures (BACTEC Plus Aerobic\/F and BACTEC Plus Anaerobic\/F; BD, Pont-de-Claix, France) were performed upon admission. A brain computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed a subdural empyema compressing the right frontal lobe. Arteriography of the cerebral vessels revealed possible thrombophlebitis of the longitudinal median sinus. Antimicrobial treatment with cefotaxime at 12 g\/day, metronidazole at 1.5 g\/day, and acyclovir at 2.4 g\/day was started. The general condition of the patient rapidly worsened, leading to sepsis and aggravation of his neurologic symptoms. On the second day after admission, a right frontal craniotomy was performed. A subdural empyema was evacuated and the frontal sinuses were drained. Thiamphenicol (750 mg) was injected into the operative cavity. Postsurgical treatment consisted of metronidazole, cefotaxime, ofloxacin, carbamazepine, and heparin. Gram staining of the empyema revealed numerous polymorphonuclear cells and small gram-negative rods. Rare colonies of Streptococcus anginosus grew on chocolate agar under aerobic conditions and also on blood agar supplemented with hemin and vitamin K1 under anaerobic conditions. Rare colonies of S. anginosus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus were isolated from the frontal sinus sample. On the fourth day of hospitalization, Dialister pneumosintes (IBS 708\/99) was obtained from one of the blood cultures done on the day of admission. All other blood cultures done remained negative during the rest of the patient's hospitalization. The patient became afebrile 3 days after surgical evacuation. Metronidazole and cefotaxime were continued for an additional 19 days. The patient was discharged from the hospital in good condition with instructions to take oral antibiotics (amoxicillin at 6 g\/day and ofloxacin at 400 mg\/day) for 21 more days.  A 66-year-old man was admitted to the same hospitl for right-side tonic-clonic seizures. On physical examination, the patient was afebrile but was postictal and had right-side hemiparesis, right-side extensor plantar response, and expressive aphasia. He had moderate gingivitis and periodontolysis of three teeth. Laboratory investigations revealed a moderate inflammatory syndrome: C-reactive protein measured 15.6 mg\/liter, fibrinogen measured 4.83 g\/liter, and the patient's leukocyte count measured 15.4 \u00d7 10 cells\/liter with 87.9% neutrophils. A brain CT scan revealed a left posterior frontal lesion surrounded by edema. Preinterventional magnetic resonance imaging revealed a possible infectious etiology to the lesion. A craniotomy was performed, and greenish pus was evacuated from the frontal lesion. Gram staining of this sample revealed numerous polymorphonuclear cells and gram-positive rods. No antibiotics were given prior to performance of the craniotomy. Aerobic cultures were negative for growth, and anaerobic cultures yielded only rare colonies of D. pneumosintes (IBS 18607\/00). The patient was treated intravenously for 21 days with cefotaxime at 8 g\/day, fosfomycin at 16 g\/day, and metronidazole at 1.5 g\/day. The patient did well; thoracic and abdominal CT scans as well as heart and liver ultrasonography results were normal. The patient was discharged in goodcondition with instructions to take oral antibiotics (ofloxacin and metronidazole) and intramuscular teicoplanin for 3 weeks.  Standard phenotypic tests for anaerobic bacteria (11) of both strains revealed gram-negative rods which were strictly anaerobic, nonpigmented, nonmotile, non-spore-forming, and nonsaccharolytic. The usual biochemical tests were negative. This was consistent with an identification of D. pneumosintes but also with several other nonsaccharolytic gram-negative anaerobic rods (11). Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by agar diffusion (E test; AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) with brucella blood agar in accordance with the recommendations of the National Breakpoint Committee of the French Society for Microbiology (2). Both isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefotaxime, imipenem, chloramphenicol, and metronidazole, and both were resistant to erythromycin and vancomycin. Bacterial DNA was extracted as previously described (4), and the 16S rRNA gene was amplified according to the previously published procedures (1, 12). The amplified fragments were purified with a CHROMA SPIN 100 column (Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Partial sequencing (of 610 bp) of a variable region was performed on both coding and complementary strands by using two primers that were 5\u2032 end labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium), namely, primer P8 (5\u2032-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3\u2032) and primer Pc804 (5\u2032-GTGGACTACCAGGGTATCTAATCC-3\u2032). By using the CLUSTAL method (9), the DNA sequences obtained were compared with those from other D. pneumosintes strains and other members of the Sporomusa, a subbranch of the Clostridium subphylum cluster IX, which contains closely interrelated bacteria that belong to the genera Dialister, Megasphaera, and Veillonella (20), sequences which are available from GenBank (Table \u200b(Table1).1). The two isolated strains, IBS 708\/99 and IBS 18607\/00, displayed exactly the same 16S rRNA partial gene sequences, which were very similar to those of D. pneumosintes strain SC3D (99.3% similarity) and D. pneumosintes ATCC 33048 (99.8%) (14). These data indicate that the two isolates are very closely related or identical to the D. pneumosintes species, in accordance with previously established criteria (18). Percentage of similarity of 610 bp from the 16S rRNA genes of D. pneumosintes and other related bacteria  D. pneumosintes is a small, nonfermentative, gram-negative anaerobic rod which was first described by Olisky and Gates as Bacterium pneumosintes and obtained from the nasopharyngeal secretions of patients with influenza during the epidemics of 1918 through 1921 (17). After several phylogenetic reclassifications over the last several years, it was reclassified as D. pneumosintes (10, 14, 20). Precise identification of the bacterium cannot be performed by morphological and traditional biochemical means and therefore requires nucleotide sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (20). Very little clinical and microbiological information is available about human diseases caused by D. pneumosintes because of the lack of an accurate biochemical identification method. Before the use of molecular methods, D. pneumosintes was suspected to be associated with brain infections alone or in association with S. anginosus (10). This assumption was never firmly established because of the poor results of both the phenotypic characterization and analysis of the short-chain fatty acids by direct gas-liquid chromatography (8, 10). Our two cases firmly establish for the first time that D. pneumosintes may be associated with cerebral abscesses. In the first case, D. pneumosintes was found in mixed flora associated with S. anginosus. It is most likely that the gram-negative bacilli visualized by direct microscopic examination of the subdural samples from the patient were D. pneumosintes and that the related bacteremia was caused by the subdural empyema. The most likely source of the infection was the frontal sinuses from which S. anginosus was isolated. In the second case, the monomicrobial culture of D. pneumosintes from the brain abscess proved the involvement of the microbe in the infectious process. It is possible that the gram-positive rods visualized by the Gram stain and which did not grow in the culture were fastidious bacteria, since these kinds of organisms are not uncommon in brain abscesses. We believe that their gram-positive appearance was likely due to inadequate decolorization of the Gram stain, since only one type of bacteria was seen on direct examination of the pus collected from the craniotomy. Gram staining could not be repeated because all of the material was used in the culture. As reported previously (13), the absence of fever and the moderate inflammatory syndrome may not exclude the diagnosis of brain abscess. The patient's poor dental hygiene could be a predisposing factor for D. pneumosintes infection. On the basis of the phenotypic characterization, D. pneumosintes was supposed to be a commensal organism of the oral cavity (mainly of the gingival crevices) (10) and to be normally present in nasopharyngeal, intestinal, and vaginal flora (6, 10). D. pneumosintes was also suspected to be a periodontal pathogen responsible for gingivitis (15, 16). On the basis of genotypic characterization, D. pneumosintes has been detected in severe periodontitis, gingivitis, and dentoalveolar abscesses in association with other anaerobic species (3, 5, 19). Apart from periodontal infections, this bacterium was previously suspected to be responsible for various supradiaphragmatic infections (in the respiratory tract, head, and neck) (10) and could be isolated from bite wound infections (7), blood (10), and amniotic fluid and placentas of pregnant women with premature rupture of the amniotic sac (6). In all of these cases, the identification was performed only on the basis of phenotypic characteristics. During our 2-year study, using the same molecular methods, we documented two additional cases of D. pneumosintes bacteremia in two patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. The bacteria may have originated in the gut. These two patients died 1 and 2 weeks, respectively, after the diagnosis of bacteremia, but the primary cause of death was not D. pneumosintes. Our data show that D. pneumosintes contained in mixed flora may behave as a deadly pathogen, especially in the brain, in addition to causing periodontal or opportunistic infections."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whether D. pneumosintes is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"15-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-negative","answer_start":6415,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of D. pneumosintes?","id":"15-1-3-2","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic","answer_start":10433,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about D. pneumosintes's requirement for oxygen?","id":"15-1-3-3","answers":[{"text":"anaerobic","answer_start":6429,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of D. pneumosintes?","id":"15-1-3-4","answers":[{"text":"rod","answer_start":6439,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does D. pneumosintes normally exist?","id":"15-1-3-5","answers":[{"text":"oral cavity","answer_start":9023,"id":1},{"text":"nasopharyngeal, intestinal, and vaginal flora","answer_start":9104,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are D. pneumosintes sensitive to?","id":"15-1-3-6","answers":[{"text":"amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefotaxime, imipenem, chloramphenicol, and metronidazole","answer_start":4668,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are D. pneumosintes resistant to?","id":"15-1-3-7","answers":[{"text":"erythromycin and vancomycin","answer_start":4820,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can D. pneumosintes cause?","id":"15-1-3-8","answers":[{"text":"cerebral abscesses","answer_start":7581,"id":1},{"text":"periodontitis, gingivitis, and dentoalveolar abscesses","answer_start":9348,"id":2},{"text":"various supradiaphragmatic infections (in the respiratory tract, head, and neck","answer_start":9556,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" A 17-year-old man was admitted to Strasbourg University Hospital for fever and dysphagia that had evolved over 1 week. Prior to admission, he had received amoxicillin and then clarithromycin. On physical examination, he presented with a high fever (40\u00b0C), right temporal headache, paralysis of the left arm, and swelling of the submandibular lymph nodes. Laboratory investigations revealed an inflammatory syndrome with a C-reactive protein level measuring 118 mg\/liter and a leukocyte count of 13.3 \u00d7 10 cells\/liter. Standard cerebrospinal fluid analysis as well as aerobic and anaerobic cultures did not reveal any abnormalities. Two aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures (BACTEC Plus Aerobic\/F and BACTEC Plus Anaerobic\/F; BD, Pont-de-Claix, France) were performed upon admission. A brain computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed a subdural empyema compressing the right frontal lobe. Arteriography of the cerebral vessels revealed possible thrombophlebitis of the longitudinal median sinus. Antimicrobial treatment with cefotaxime at 12 g\/day, metronidazole at 1.5 g\/day, and acyclovir at 2.4 g\/day was started. The general condition of the patient rapidly worsened, leading to sepsis and aggravation of his neurologic symptoms. On the second day after admission, a right frontal craniotomy was performed. A subdural empyema was evacuated and the frontal sinuses were drained. Thiamphenicol (750 mg) was injected into the operative cavity. Postsurgical treatment consisted of metronidazole, cefotaxime, ofloxacin, carbamazepine, and heparin. Gram staining of the empyema revealed numerous polymorphonuclear cells and small gram-negative rods. Rare colonies of Streptococcus anginosus grew on chocolate agar under aerobic conditions and also on blood agar supplemented with hemin and vitamin K1 under anaerobic conditions. Rare colonies of S. anginosus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus were isolated from the frontal sinus sample. On the fourth day of hospitalization, Dialister pneumosintes (IBS 708\/99) was obtained from one of the blood cultures done on the day of admission. All other blood cultures done remained negative during the rest of the patient's hospitalization. The patient became afebrile 3 days after surgical evacuation. Metronidazole and cefotaxime were continued for an additional 19 days. The patient was discharged from the hospital in good condition with instructions to take oral antibiotics (amoxicillin at 6 g\/day and ofloxacin at 400 mg\/day) for 21 more days.  A 66-year-old man was admitted to the same hospitl for right-side tonic-clonic seizures. On physical examination, the patient was afebrile but was postictal and had right-side hemiparesis, right-side extensor plantar response, and expressive aphasia. He had moderate gingivitis and periodontolysis of three teeth. Laboratory investigations revealed a moderate inflammatory syndrome: C-reactive protein measured 15.6 mg\/liter, fibrinogen measured 4.83 g\/liter, and the patient's leukocyte count measured 15.4 \u00d7 10 cells\/liter with 87.9% neutrophils. A brain CT scan revealed a left posterior frontal lesion surrounded by edema. Preinterventional magnetic resonance imaging revealed a possible infectious etiology to the lesion. A craniotomy was performed, and greenish pus was evacuated from the frontal lesion. Gram staining of this sample revealed numerous polymorphonuclear cells and gram-positive rods. No antibiotics were given prior to performance of the craniotomy. Aerobic cultures were negative for growth, and anaerobic cultures yielded only rare colonies of D. pneumosintes (IBS 18607\/00). The patient was treated intravenously for 21 days with cefotaxime at 8 g\/day, fosfomycin at 16 g\/day, and metronidazole at 1.5 g\/day. The patient did well; thoracic and abdominal CT scans as well as heart and liver ultrasonography results were normal.

In this case report we describe the clinical course of a 13-year-old, female, obese patient with severe pneumonia leading to a sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to a systemic infection with D. pneumosintes.

The origin of the systemic spread can most likely be found in the extensive sinusitis of the right sinus frontalis, maxillaris and right cellulae ethmoidales diagnosed in the CT scan at hospital admission. As Kogure and colleagues described previously, there is an apparent risk of a systemic bacteremia caused by a severe sinusitis [6], even though we did not cultivate D. pneumosintes from a sinusal fluid sample. Since D. pneumosintes is mainly found in the nasopharyngeal cavity, there is a high possibility that the sinusitis originates from a naso-buccal translocation as seen previously [7,8]. Moore et al., could show that D. pneumosintes constitutes part of the oral bacterial flora, especially in subgingival sites and can cause gingivitis and periodontitis in children and young adults [9]. Our patient became severely ill, needed prolonged mechanical ventilation and intensive care treatment, despite lack of risk factors in the personal history apart of being obese. Castellanos and colleagues described a severe pneumonia due to an infection of D. pneumosintes in a patient with COPD [10] and Bahrani-Mougeot and colleagues identified D. pneumosintes among other pathogens in a trauma patient with ventilation-associated pneumonia [11]. Overall, our clinical case shows that an immunocompetent patient with no personal history of pulmonary disease can suffer from severe clinical courses due to D. pneumosintes. Furthermore, patients with an extended history of risk factors can present severe clinical courses, as described in one case leading to death [5]. Risk factors such as obesity may contribute the disease severity and respiratory failure in our case as well [12]. Interestingly, in our case we observed multiple small abscess formations in the course of pneumonia, which could be treated with antibiotics without surgical intervention and showed almost complete resolution in the recent follow-up. A similar radiological pattern as in our case was observed by Castellanos et al. [10] showing in part cavitation and abscessing. Since S. aureus was detected in the initial tracheal aspirate it may have contributed to the clinical and radiological picture as a co-pathogen or even as the culprit. Reviewing preexisting literature of other systemic D. pneumosintes cases indicated the potential to form extensive abscesses. As described in three previous reports there is a high risk of local translocation to form periapical abscess or sinusitis [6,13] and even a frontal brain abscess [14]. The anatomic proximity suggests a continuous venous translocation. Interestingly, D. pneumosintes could also be identified in these lastly mentioned cases in anaerobic blood cultures due to a systemic bacteremia. Overall, more than half (six) of the reviewed reports could identify D. pneumosintes through blood cultures [4,5,6,13,14,15]. Most recently, a case of 30-year-old previously healthy woman was diagnosed with mediastinal and neck abscess caused by D. pneumosintes, after she already received a 2-week course of oral antibiotic for suspected dental abscess [15]. In 4 out of 10 cases, D. pneumosintes could be identified through cultivation of material obtained via intervention. Out of these four, D. pneumosintes was cultivated in two cases with pneumonia from a bronchoalveolar lavage [10,11] and in the other two cases from pus of a drained brain abscess and liver [14,16]. In total 6 of the 10 reviewed cases needed surgical treatment [6,13,14,15,16]. Six of the reviewed cases show either a sinusal or dental focus as cause for the infection with D. pneumosintes [6,13,14,15,16], the other reports don\u2019t further specify the supposed origin of D. pneumosintes even though all cases refer to D. pneumosintes as a known pathogen of the oropharyngeal cavity causing periodontitis and sinusitis as outlined before. Of note, blood culture TTP in our case was 34 h. In a recent report, blood culture TTP for clinically relevant anaerobic bacteria was 31.4 \u00b1 23.4 h, indicating at the necessity to consider this fact in the diagnostic and treatment decision process [17]. Moreover, anaerobic infections are usually of polymicrobial nature and frequently require surgical intervention. Therefore, antibiotic regiments should cover aerobic as well as anaerobic antibiotics as we have used in our case (piperacillin\/tazobactam, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sultamicillin) [18]."}]},{"title":"Dialister pneumosintes can be a suspected endodontic pathogen","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Dialister pneumosintes is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"15-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-negative","answer_start":111,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Dialister pneumosintes's requirement for oxygen?","id":"15-3-1-2","answers":[{"text":"obligately anaerobic","answer_start":89,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Dialister pneumosintes?","id":"15-3-1-3","answers":[{"text":"bacillus","answer_start":125,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Dialister pneumosintes cause?","id":"15-3-1-4","answers":[{"text":"endodontic pathogens","answer_start":1449,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"  Objective:  Dialister pneumosintes is a nonmotile, nonfermentative, non-spore-forming, obligately anaerobic, gram-negative bacillus that has been associated with some infections in the human body. A species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction assay was used to investigate the occurrence of D pneumosintes in primary root canal infections.    Study design:  Samples were collected from 32 teeth with carious lesions, necrotic pulps, and radiographic evidence of periradicular bone destruction. Twenty-two teeth were asymptomatic, and 10 cases were diagnosed as acute apical periodontitis. DNA extracted from the samples was initially amplified with universal 16S ribosomal DNA primers. A second round of amplification used the first polymerase chain reaction products to specifically detect D pneumosintes.    Results:  This bacterial species was detected in 17 of 22 asymptomatic cases (77.3%) and in 4 of 10 root canals associated with acute apical periodontitis (40%). No relationship was found between the presence of this bacterial species and the occurrence of symptoms. In general, D pneumosintes was detected in 21 of 32 root canal samples (65.6%).    Conclusion:  This study is the first to report a high prevalence of D pneumosintes in root canal infections of humans.

Twenty-five BSI episodes caused by P. mirabilis occurred at our hospital (Ospedale di Circolo e Fondazione Macchi, Varese, Italy) over a 7.5-year period. Phenotypic and molecular methods were used to assess ESBL production. Clinical records of BSI patients were examined retrospectively. Demographic data, underlying diseases (according to McCabe and Jackson classification and Charlson weighted index), risk factors, and treatment outcome were investigated by comparing cases due to ESBL-positive strains to cases due to ESBL-negative strains. Eleven isolates were found to express ESBLs (TEM-52 or TEM-92). The remaining 14 isolates were ESBL negative and were uniformly susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and monobactams. Comparison of the two groups showed that previous hospitalization in a nursing home (P = 0.04) and use of bladder catheter (P = 0.01) were significant risk factors for infections due to ESBL-positive strains. In addition, cases due to ESBL-positive strains showed a significantly higher mortality attributable to BSI (P = 0.04). BSI cases due to ESBL-negative isolates uniformly responded to therapy, whereas 5\/11 cases due to ESBL-positive isolates failed to respond (P < 0.01). Use of carbapenems was associated with complete response independently of ESBL production. Therapeutic failure and mortality may occur in BSI episodes caused by ESBL-positive P. mirabilis isolates.

Genes encoding ESBLs are usually located in transferable plasmids and are generally mutants of the classical TEM-1\/2 type \u03b2-lactamases (3, 4). Moreover, coresistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been frequently reported among ESBL-P-PM strains (7, 20, 39). Thus, treatment of severe infections due to ESBL-positive enterobacteria is often limited to carbapenems (29, 33, 37). BSI risk factors and the impact of ESBL-related bacteremia on treatment outcome have been investigated solely in infections due to ESBL-positive isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10, 17, 19, 23, 28, 40). BSI due to P. mirabilis is relatively uncommon (9, 12, 21, 34), and its clinical significance has received little attention (2, 16, 38). To our best knowledge, no studies on systemic infections caused by ESBL-P-PM isolates have been published. In this work we have studied 25 cases of BSI caused by P. mirabilis, 14 caused by ESBL-negative P. mirabilis (ESBL-N-PM), and 11 by ESBL-P-PM. Clinical and microbiological data have been compared between the above two groups of BSI patients in order to evaluate risk factors and treatment outcome."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the shape of P. mirabilis?","id":"16-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"bacilli","answer_start":1038,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Initially more prevalent in K. pneumoniae and E. coli, ESBLs are now also emerging resistance determinants in other enterobacterial species, including P. mirabilis (37). In fact, ESBL production has been reported among P. mirabilis in several epidemiological settings, with a prevalence that can exceed 20% in some areas (39). This trend is a matter of major concern, since P. mirabilis is a common cause of human infections and accounts for approximately 3% of nosocomial infections (5), while ESBL-producing P. mirabilis strains are usually resistant to several antimicrobial agents and can result in difficult-to-treat infections (7, 20). Concerning BSI, several studies have analyzed risk factors, clinical outcome, and treatment outcome of BSI caused by ESBL-positive isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae (10, 17, 19, 23, 28, 40), while analogous aspects have not been investigated for BSI caused by ESBL-P-PM isolates. Although P. mirabilis is a less common cause of BSI (1 to 2% of total cases, ranking fourth among gram-negative bacilli following E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Enterobacter spp.) (9, 12, 21, 34), the increasing diffusion of ESBL in strains of this species is now making this issue more interesting. Our retrospective study addressed this aspect, by evaluating a total of 25 BSI episodes caused by either ESBL-N-PM or ESBL-P-PM isolates that occurred at the Varese University hospital over a 7.5-year period. The relatively high number of episodes caused by ESBL-P-PM isolates (44.0%) observed during this period likely reflects the notable diffusion of ESBL-P-PM isolates in the northern Italian setting (20, 36). The absolute prevalence of the TEM-52\/92 enzymes encountered in this study is fully consistent with the high prevalence of these ESBLs observed in P. mirabilis from this epidemiological setting (30, 31). In agreement with previous studies on BSI episodes due to ESBL-positive E. coli and K. pneumoniae (17, 23) isolates, our results confirm that risk factors, including previous hospitalization in a nursing home and use of bladder catheters, are significantly associated with BSI episodes due to ESBL-P-PM isolates. For other known risk factors, such as prolonged hospitalization before BSI, previous use of antibiotics, use of intravascular catheter, and previous urinary tract infection, statistical significance was not attained, but this was likely due to the low number of studied cases. Concerning mortality attributable to BSI, our findings showed that it was significantly higher in BSI episodes caused by ESBL-P-PM isolates than in those caused by ESBL-N-PM isolates. This finding is in agreement with previous studies reporting a higher BSI-attributable mortality in episodes caused by ESBL-positive E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates than in episodes caused by ESBL-negative isolates (11, 19), although other studies failed to confirm this result (17, 23). Statistical analysis also revealed higher rates of adequate empirical and rational therapeutic regimens in cases of BSI caused by ESBL-N-PM isolates and an overall better treatment outcome for BSI caused by ESBL-N-PM isolates (P < 0.01). Although all the ESBL-P-PM isolates were susceptible to BLBLIC in vitro and most of them were also susceptible to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, BLBLIC and expanded-spectrum cephalosporins were consistently effective only against ESBL-N-PM isolates, whereas carbapenems showed a good clinical efficacy against both ESBL-negative and ESBL-positive strains. The only two patients infected by ESBL-P-PM isolates who showed clinical response following treatment with expanded-spectrum cephalosporins were also treated with an aminoglycoside. In interpreting the above data, it is important to note the following. (i) Differences between the investigated groups of BSI patients cannot be ascribed to differences in drug dosage, since all patients received adequate dosages (14). (ii) Treatment was started in all cases within 4 days of BSI onset, as recommended (35) (only case 461\/02 was started on day five, but a positive treatment outcome was obtained). (iii) The average time of treatment was approximately 10 days, as currently recommended (41). Present results, therefore, indicate that expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and BLBLIC are not reliable options for BSI episodes due to ESBL-P-PM isolates. These findings are consistent with previous reports on BSI caused by other species of ESBL-positive enterobacteria (17, 19, 27, 28, 40) and strongly underscore the need to extend the revision of the CLSI interpretive criteria for ESBL producers also to P. mirabilis. The significantly higher rates of inadequate empirical and rational therapeutic regimens in BSI episodes caused by ESBL-P-PM isolates (see above) are clearly related to this issue and to an overall low awareness of the problem. Special tests capable of detecting ESBL-P-PM isolates would be useful for the therapeutic management of infections. In our study ESBL-P-PM strains were detected equally well by the double-disk method and the Etest synergy strips (20), as in the case of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. (24). In conclusion, although large multicenter studies may be required for defining diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for infections due to different species of ESBL-positive enterobacteria, our results indicate that\u2014as suggested for other species (29, 33, 37)\u2014carbapenems are preferable to other \u03b2-lactams for BSI caused by ESBL-P-PM isolates. This conclusion reinforces our previous observation that the treatment outcome of BSI episodes due to TEM-52-positive enterobacteria was satisfactory in patients treated with carbapenems (10)."}]},{"title":"Proteus mirabilis and Urinary Tract Infections","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Proteus mirabilis is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"16-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":24,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Proteus mirabilis cause?","id":"16-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"a pathogen of the urinary tract, particularly in patients undergoing long-term catheterization","answer_start":195,"id":1},{"text":"urinary tract infections","answer_start":339,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Proteus mirabilis is a Gram-negative bacterium and is well known for its ability to robustly swarm across surfaces in a striking bulls'-eye pattern.

The regulation of this complex process and its contribution to virulence is discussed, along with the type VI-secretion system-dependent intra-strain competition, which occurs during swarming. P. mirabilis uses a diverse set of virulence factors to access and colonize the host urinary tract, including urease and stone formation, fimbriae and other adhesins, iron and zinc acquisition, proteases and toxins, biofilm formation, and regulation of pathogenesis.

Hence for the foreseeable future, probiotic administration, particularly when antibiotics are being used, would seem to be acceptable practice. However, there have been many reports in the literature implicating lactobacillus as the pathogen for various infections, particularly, bacteremia and endocarditis, with the lactobacillus species casei and rhamnosus being the commonest culprits. Previous reports suggested that the incidence of infections caused by lactobacilli species is very low (0.08\u20130.2%) and such infection on its own is rarely fatal. However co-infection with lactobacillus species can be a marker of severe infection and risk factor for prolonged hospitalization, or even death. A retrospective review of 200 cases, quoted an overall mortality of 30% with a greater mortality associated with polymicrobial infection. Since Lactobacilli are part of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, it can be difficult to determine when an infection is caused by an endogenous species or one that is administered. There is a theoretical risk of potential transmigration of probiotics in the gastrointestinal tracts leading to colonization or even infection, through the alteration of normal physiology. However, the literature has not demonstrated a link between administered probiotics and subsequent infections. Our patient received L. acidophilus early in his admission, a different species from the L. fermentum that we isolated. Therefore, it is likely that the pathogen was endogenous within his gastrointestinal tract. Nevertheless, we discontinued the probiotic once the culture was finalized. We believe that the lactobacillus species isolated in our patient was serving as a pathogen as opposed to mere colonization, especially as this particular antibiotic-resistant strain of lactobacillus was isolated from two normally sterile sites. Although the pathogen was not cultured until day 9, we believe it to be the source of the patient's initial symptoms rather than an opportunistic or superseding infection. While lactobacillus is usually isolated as part of a polymicrobial infection, our patient did not have any other bacteria grown on culture. This supports the argument that the bacterium served as a primary pathogen. On presentation, the patient received antibiotics for gram-negative coverage; whilst this practice suffices for most cases of cholecystitis it was not adequate for the L. fermentum in our patient. The natural history prevailed and he deteriorated. This would explain why his initial blood culture was negative. The blood culture sent on hospital day 9 was positive for L. fermentum, the same strain identified from the cholecystostomy aspirate. When placed on appropriate antibiotics, the patient's clinical condition initially improved but concomitant infections (of the urinary tract, and pneumonia) contributed to his demise. The literature suggests that early cholecystectomy (within 48\u201372 h of the onset of symptoms) can lead to a better outcome in acute cholecystitis. But, there is also evidence that elderly patients with multiple co-morbid conditions do better with non-operative management of acute cholecystitis. Our patient presented two weeks after the onset of his symptoms, with clinical evidence of sepsis. Operative management was therefore not deemed a wise choice especially as he had improved initially on appropriate antibiotics, with adequate percutaneous drainage. His clinical course suggests that the development of pneumonia and unresolved candiduria, in addition to his overwhelming systemic response, played a greater role to his demise than the cholecystitis. This assessment is supported by the literature on lactobacillus infections, which usually serve as a nidus for other infections."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Lactobacillus fermentum cause?","id":"17-1-4-1","answers":[{"text":"cholecystitis","answer_start":90,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"To our knowledge, this is the first report of a lactobacillus species being implicated in cholecystitis.

They are found in the normal microbiota of the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and female genitourinary tract. Although lactobacilli are generally considered non-pathogenic microbes and some of their strains are utilized as probiotics to prevent and treat some infections, they have been implicated in some serious clinical infections including bacteremia, infective endocarditis, intra-abdominal abscess including liver abscess, pancreatic necrosis infection, pulmonary infections, pyelonephritis, meningitis, postpartum endometritis, and chorioamnionitis [1\u201314]. The most common risk factors for lactobacilli infections that have been reported in the literature are diabetes mellitus, pre-existing structural heart disease (in infective endocarditis cases), cancer (especially leukemia), total parenteral nutrition use, broad spectrum antibiotic use, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, chemotherapy, neutropenia, organ transplantation (especially liver transplantation), HIV infection and steroids use [1\u201314]. The most common predisposing events are dental manipulation, poor dental hygiene, intravenous drug abuse, abdominal surgery, colonoscopy, probiotics use, and heavy dairy product consumption [1\u201312]. The antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacilli is variable. The most common regimens that have been used to treat lactobacilli are high dose penicillin and ampicillin with or without aminoglycosides. In a retrospective study of 45 cases of lactobacilli bacteremia, the bacteria were susceptible to ampicillin (100%), penicillin (96%), clindamycin (100%), erythromycin (100%), and gentamycin (67%), with high resistance rate to vancomycin (73% were resistant) [5]. Due to rarity of the infections with this microbe, clinical experience and studies are lacking regarding the best antibiotic regimens.

The risk factors for developing pyogenic liver abscess are advanced age, diabetes mellitus, liver transplantation, underlying hepatobiliary disease and history of malignancy [21\u201325]. The mortality rate has decreased significantly over last six decades from 65% before the 1970s to 10\u201312.3% in recent studies [21\u201325]. Independent risk factors associated with mortality are significant delay in diagnosis, severity of sepsis, presence of gas forming bacteria, presence of anaerobic infection, hepatopancreaticobiliary malignancy and requirement for open surgical drainage [24, 25]. Liver abscesses usually result from seeding of bacteria from the portal vein or biliary tract; however, hematogenous spread from systemic circulation or direct seeding from penetrating wounds may be the main mechanism in other cases [22, 25]. A considerable proportion of liver abscesses result from polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with some differences based on the underlying disease. The geographic area may also play a role, for example klebsiella pneumoniae is the most common isolated bacteria in Hong Kong [22, 23, 25]. Pyogenic liver abscess due to lactobacillus has rarely been reported in the literature. Our case developed in an elderly diabetic woman after four months of a cholecystectomy which was complicated by bleeding from the surgical site which required surgical drainage. Whether she had bacterial seeding at the time of the surgery or had bacterial translocation from the colon from probiotic bacteria or intestinal microbiota is not clear.

In a retrospective study of 200 cases of endocarditis caused by lactobacilli the mortality rate was 23% which was higher in cases of polymicrobial bacteremia and use of inadequate antibiotics [1]. It has also been shown that lactobacillus infection is a predictor of severe underlying comorbidities and poor long-term prognosis. In a study by Husni et al. 69% of patients with lactobacilli infections died within 1 year and only one death was attributed directly to lactobacillus bacteremia which was polymicrobial [5]. Some strains of lactobacilli are used as probiotics to, presumably, restore non-pathogenic intestinal microbiota and decrease digestive colonization with pathogenic bacteria. The increasing reports of probiotic related infections have raised concern over the safety of these organisms. The epidemiologic study by Salminen et al. published in 2002 did not show an increase in lactobacillus bacteremia after wide use of lactobacillus rhamnosus GG as a probiotic which was introduced to Finland in 1990 [26]. In this study, the average annual incidence of lactobacilli bacteremia was 0.29 cases per 100,000 during the 11 year study period [26]. An increase in nosocomial infections in intensive care pediatric patients and an increase in mortalities in severe acute pancreatitis have been documented in probiotic groups in randomized placebo-controlled studies [27, 28]. In a systemic review of the safety of probiotics in 2010 including 53 trials in which 4131 patients received probiotics, all but three trials showed no increase in complications related to using probiotics [29]. The potential pathogenicity of lactobacilli might come from several mechanisms including the ability of some strains to bind to intestinal mucosa which may play a role in translocation of lactobacilli into the bloodstream; their ability to adhere to extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen; their ability to aggregate platelets; their production of certain enzymes such as glycosidases and proteases which may help to breakdown the glycoproteins of affected tissues [30\u201332]. In vitro and in vivo experimental studies have shown that some strains are more resistant than others to intracellular killing by macrophages and by the bactericidal effects of nitric oxide [33]. Several cases of lactobacilli related infections have been reported in pediatric and adults using probiotics containing lactobacilli [34\u201342]. The underlying diseases were preexisting heart disease, HIV infection, organ transplantation, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, and short gut syndrome [34\u201342]. There were no cases of liver abscesses which makes our case the first case of lactobacillus liver abscess linked to probiotics use. In our case, the inflamed colonic mucosa due to Clostridium difficile colitis may have allowed the translocation of intestinal microbiota lactobacilli or probiotic lactobacilli to the bloodstream and colonized the previously damaged tissue in liver and gallbladder site. The exact Lactobacillus identification and antibiotic sensitivity were not performed, as well as the culture from the probiotic product. Whether the probiotics product contained the identical strain of Lactobacillus as the patient\u2019s abscess is not known. However, the temporal relationship between use of the probiotics containing Lactobacillus and development of liver abscess with Lactobacillus, make the probiotic product a possible source. In conclusion, probiotics may lead to bacteremia and liver abscesses in some susceptible persons and greater awareness of this potential side effect is warranted with the increasing use of probiotics containing lactobacilli."}]}]},{"species":"Lactobacillus crispatus","docs":[{"title":"Liver abscess and bacteremia caused by lactobacillus: role of probiotics?

In this paper we discuss a case of an 82 year old female with liver abscess and bacteremia from lactobacillus after using probiotics containing lactobacilli in the course of her treatment of Clostridium difficile colitis. The Lactobacillus strain identification was not performed and therefore, both commensal microbiota and the probiotic product should be considered as possible sources of the strain. Lactobacilli can lead to bacteremia and liver abscesses in some susceptible persons and greater awareness of this potential side effect is warranted with the increasing use of probiotics containing lactobacilli."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Lactobacillus crispatus is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"19-1-2-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram positive","answer_start":86,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Lactobacillus crispatus?","id":"19-1-2-2","answers":[{"text":"non-pathogenic","answer_start":272,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Lactobacillus crispatus's requirement for oxygen?","id":"19-1-2-3","answers":[{"text":"facultative anaerobic","answer_start":17,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Lactobacillus crispatus?","id":"19-1-2-4","answers":[{"text":"bacilli","answer_start":100,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Lactobacillus crispatus resistant to?","id":"19-1-2-5","answers":[{"text":"vancomycin","answer_start":1781,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Lactobacillus crispatus normally exist?","id":"19-1-2-6","answers":[{"text":"oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and female genitourinary tract","answer_start":156,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Lactobacillus crispatus sensitive to?","id":"19-1-2-7","answers":[{"text":"ampicillin (100%), penicillin (96%), clindamycin (100%), erythromycin (100%), and gentamycin (67%)","answer_start":1652,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Lactobacilli are facultative anaerobic, non-spore forming, lactic acid producing, and Gram positive bacilli. They are found in the normal microbiota of the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and female genitourinary tract. Although lactobacilli are generally considered non-pathogenic microbes and some of their strains are utilized as probiotics to prevent and treat some infections, they have been implicated in some serious clinical infections including bacteremia, infective endocarditis, intra-abdominal abscess including liver abscess, pancreatic necrosis infection, pulmonary infections, pyelonephritis, meningitis, postpartum endometritis, and chorioamnionitis [1\u201314]. The most common risk factors for lactobacilli infections that have been reported in the literature are diabetes mellitus, pre-existing structural heart disease (in infective endocarditis cases), cancer (especially leukemia), total parenteral nutrition use, broad spectrum antibiotic use, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, chemotherapy, neutropenia, organ transplantation (especially liver transplantation), HIV infection and steroids use [1\u201314]. The most common predisposing events are dental manipulation, poor dental hygiene, intravenous drug abuse, abdominal surgery, colonoscopy, probiotics use, and heavy dairy product consumption [1\u201312]. The antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacilli is variable. The most common regimens that have been used to treat lactobacilli are high dose penicillin and ampicillin with or without aminoglycosides. In a retrospective study of 45 cases of lactobacilli bacteremia, the bacteria were susceptible to ampicillin (100%), penicillin (96%), clindamycin (100%), erythromycin (100%), and gentamycin (67%), with high resistance rate to vancomycin (73% were resistant) [5]. Due to rarity of the infections with this microbe, clinical experience and studies are lacking regarding the best antibiotic regimens. The incidence of serious infections caused by lactobacilli is generally uncommon and rare with liver abscess with only 7 reported cases in the literature [14\u201320]. A previous case of liver abscess caused by a lactobacillus strain (indistinguishable from the strain used in food preparation) has been reported. In that case, there was a four month history of excessive dairy products consumption before the development of liver abscess with no use of probiotics. The association between liver abscess and use of probiotics containing lactobacilli has not been reported previously [19]. In this paper, we describe a case of liver abscess due to lactobacillus strain in an elderly diabetic woman with end stage renal disease after using probiotics containing lactobacilli in a course of treatment of Clostridium difficile colitis and review the literature. We followed CARE reporting guidelines in publishing our case report."},{"qas":[{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Lactobacillus crispatus?","id":"19-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"non-pathogenic","answer_start":3738,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Pyogenic liver abscesses are relatively uncommon, however they are considered the most common type of intra-abdominal abscesses with an annual incidence of 2.3 cases per 100,000 [21, 22]. The risk factors for developing pyogenic liver abscess are advanced age, diabetes mellitus, liver transplantation, underlying hepatobiliary disease and history of malignancy [21\u201325]. The mortality rate has decreased significantly over last six decades from 65% before the 1970s to 10\u201312.3% in recent studies [21\u201325]. Independent risk factors associated with mortality are significant delay in diagnosis, severity of sepsis, presence of gas forming bacteria, presence of anaerobic infection, hepatopancreaticobiliary malignancy and requirement for open surgical drainage [24, 25]. Liver abscesses usually result from seeding of bacteria from the portal vein or biliary tract; however, hematogenous spread from systemic circulation or direct seeding from penetrating wounds may be the main mechanism in other cases [22, 25]. A considerable proportion of liver abscesses result from polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with some differences based on the underlying disease. The geographic area may also play a role, for example klebsiella pneumoniae is the most common isolated bacteria in Hong Kong [22, 23, 25]. Pyogenic liver abscess due to lactobacillus has rarely been reported in the literature. Our case developed in an elderly diabetic woman after four months of a cholecystectomy which was complicated by bleeding from the surgical site which required surgical drainage. Whether she had bacterial seeding at the time of the surgery or had bacterial translocation from the colon from probiotic bacteria or intestinal microbiota is not clear. We used the MeSH database in Pubmed with the terms \u201clactobacillus\u201d and \u201cliver abscess\u201d. We found 7 additional cases of liver abscesses due to lactobacilli strains (Table 1) [14\u201320]. The median age was 73.5 years (range, 27\u201382 years), with 62.5% older than 73 years of age. There was no gender tendency. The most common underlying diseases were diabetes mellitus (62.5%) and hepatopancreaticobiliary diseases (50%). Predisposing factors were steroids use, heavy dairy product consumption and intratumoral ethanol injection. In our case, the patient\u2019s recent cholecystectomy and probiotic use were considered predisposing factors. The most frequent presenting symptoms were fever (87.5%), abdominal pain (37.5%), and vomiting (25%). Leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes were the most common laboratories findings. Lactobacillus rhamnosus was the most frequently isolated strain.  Summary of case reports of liver abscesses due to lactobacilli strains  M male, F female, DM diabetes mellitus, ESRD end stage renal disease, HCC hepatocellular carcinoma, HTN hypertension, LFTs liver function tests, N\/A not available. *In foreign language; some information from English abstracts Although no mortality occurred in these 8 cases, prolonged hospitalization was a striking feature with a mean hospital stay of 48 days (range, 19\u201363 days) compared to 16 days in other cases of pyogenic liver abscesses. In a retrospective study of 200 cases of endocarditis caused by lactobacilli the mortality rate was 23% which was higher in cases of polymicrobial bacteremia and use of inadequate antibiotics [1]. It has also been shown that lactobacillus infection is a predictor of severe underlying comorbidities and poor long-term prognosis. In a study by Husni et al. 69% of patients with lactobacilli infections died within 1 year and only one death was attributed directly to lactobacillus bacteremia which was polymicrobial [5]. Some strains of lactobacilli are used as probiotics to, presumably, restore non-pathogenic intestinal microbiota and decrease digestive colonization with pathogenic bacteria. The increasing reports of probiotic related infections have raised concern over the safety of these organisms. The epidemiologic study by Salminen et al. published in 2002 did not show an increase in lactobacillus bacteremia after wide use of lactobacillus rhamnosus GG as a probiotic which was introduced to Finland in 1990 [26]. In this study, the average annual incidence of lactobacilli bacteremia was 0.29 cases per 100,000 during the 11 year study period [26]. An increase in nosocomial infections in intensive care pediatric patients and an increase in mortalities in severe acute pancreatitis have been documented in probiotic groups in randomized placebo-controlled studies [27, 28]. In a systemic review of the safety of probiotics in 2010 including 53 trials in which 4131 patients received probiotics, all but three trials showed no increase in complications related to using probiotics [29]. The potential pathogenicity of lactobacilli might come from several mechanisms including the ability of some strains to bind to intestinal mucosa which may play a role in translocation of lactobacilli into the bloodstream; their ability to adhere to extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen; their ability to aggregate platelets; their production of certain enzymes such as glycosidases and proteases which may help to breakdown the glycoproteins of affected tissues [30\u201332]. In vitro and in vivo experimental studies have shown that some strains are more resistant than others to intracellular killing by macrophages and by the bactericidal effects of nitric oxide [33]. Several cases of lactobacilli related infections have been reported in pediatric and adults using probiotics containing lactobacilli [34\u201342]. The underlying diseases were preexisting heart disease, HIV infection, organ transplantation, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, and short gut syndrome [34\u201342]. There were no cases of liver abscesses which makes our case the first case of lactobacillus liver abscess linked to probiotics use. In our case, the inflamed colonic mucosa due to Clostridium difficile colitis may have allowed the translocation of intestinal microbiota lactobacilli or probiotic lactobacilli to the bloodstream and colonized the previously damaged tissue in liver and gallbladder site. The exact Lactobacillus identification and antibiotic sensitivity were not performed, as well as the culture from the probiotic product. Whether the probiotics product contained the identical strain of Lactobacillus as the patient\u2019s abscess is not known. However, the temporal relationship between use of the probiotics containing Lactobacillus and development of liver abscess with Lactobacillus, make the probiotic product a possible source. In conclusion, probiotics may lead to bacteremia and liver abscesses in some susceptible persons and greater awareness of this potential side effect is warranted with the increasing use of probiotics containing lactobacilli."}]}]},{"species":"Lactobacillus rhamnosus","docs":[{"title":"Lactobacillus rhamnosus Infection: A Single-center 4-year Descriptive Analysis","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Lactobacillus rhamnosus is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"20-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-positive","answer_start":65,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of L. rhamnosus?","id":"20-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"low pathogenicity","answer_start":1294,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Lactobacillus rhamnosus's requirement for oxygen?","id":"20-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"anaerobic or facultative anaerobic","answer_start":30,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Lactobacillus rhamnosus?","id":"20-1-1-4","answers":[{"text":"rod","answer_start":79,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Lactobacillus rhamnosus normally exist?","id":"20-1-1-5","answers":[{"text":"human gastrointestinal tract and vaginal tract","answer_start":113,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Lactobacillus rhamnosus is an anaerobic or facultative anaerobic Gram-positive rod that is commonly found in the human gastrointestinal tract and vaginal tract.

Identified cases predominantly belonged to L. rhamnosus and L. paracasei subspecies, suggesting a greater pathogenic potential compared to other species.[18] This study concluded that due to their ability to aggregate platelets and bind to fibronectin, fibrinogen and collagen provide evidence to their pathogenicity.[18] We reviewed 35 cases of L. rhamnosus infections at our institution over a period of 4 years. Thirty-three of our patients had polymicrobial infections and more than half had disruption of the gastrointestinal tract. Other prevalent characteristics identified in our study are malignancy, prior antibiotic use, and recent surgical procedures. Historically, treatment of Lactobacillus infection consisted of high-dose penicillin and an aminoglycoside for synergy.[8,19] Other studies have also described nontraditional therapy for L. rhamnosus infection that comprised of broad-spectrum agents such as cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminopenicillins, and lincomycin.[5,9,16] Several studies showed that vancomycin demonstrated a high level of resistance.[20,21,22] However, a study by Cannon et al. showed that 22.5% of the Lactobacillus isolates were sensitive to vancomycin, and these were either L. acidophilus or unspeciated.[14] Due to this varying susceptibility pattern, treatment of Lactobacillus infection, especially lactobacillemia, should be in accordance to the pathogenic potential of the Lactobacillus strain and susceptibility testing.[2] Many microbiology laboratories, however, currently do not perform routine susceptibility testing on Lactobacillus species and therefore may not have standardized panels that can be interpreted or compared between institutions or even patient to patient at the same institution. Therefore, we would recommend case-by-case Lactobacillus susceptibility testing when there is a concern for the pathogenic involvement of the Lactobacillus strain. In this present study, none of the patients were treated with the traditional recommended regimen and our clinical data were collected retrospectively; therefore, we cannot provide recommendations as to which therapy should be selected for adequate treatment of Lactobacillus infections. Our study confirms the conclusion of previous studies that Lactobacilli exhibit a low level of pathogenicity.[3,4] More than half of our patients were cured or had clinical improvement after therapy. Eighteen patients died, but no deaths were attributed to Lactobacillus infection, and all had significant underlying medical conditions accounting for the high mortality rate in our patient population. Several studies also showed similar data, concluding that the presence of Lactobacillus, specifically lactobacillemia, was associated with worse survival.[3,14] Our study has several limitations. First, this study was retrospective in nature, and therefore, we are unable to reliably draw conclusions regarding the efficacy of treatment. Second, the patient population all had polymicrobial infections, which limits our ability to analyze Lactobacillus infection independently. In addition, many of these patients had high morbidity and mortality related to their underlying medical conditions, which is a confounding factor in analyzing the significance of the presence of Lactobacillus. Finally, this study serves as a description of Lactobacillus infections but does not attempt to compare outcomes in patients who were treated for Lactobacillus, as compared to those who were not treated."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of drugs are L. rhamnosus resistant to?","id":"20-1-4-1","answers":[{"text":"vancomycin","answer_start":778,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Lactobacillus colonizes the gastrointestinal tract and is involved in polymicrobial infections resulting from a gastrointestinal source.

The patient described in this case was healthy apart from her trauma, and was therefore immunocompetent, which may explain why her bacteraemia cleared rapidly and without the need for antibiotics. The probiotic could have entered the blood through the central venous catheter, seen in the light of its proximity to the nasogastric tube or possibly through bacterial translocation from the intestine.

Bacteraemia with L. rhamnosus is furthermore described in patients with central venous catheters on Intensive Care Units. This is why experts recommend thorough hand hygiene after handling these catheters by healthcare workers, who have previously handled probiotic formulations [13]. L. rhamnosus bacteraemia is also described among immunocompetent patients with ischemic colitis and ulcerative colitis, where a possible bacterial translocation, due to disruption of the intestinal mucosa, has taken place [14].

Lactobacillus gasseri is a member of the Lactobacillaceae family which was first identified in 1980 and prior to that was named L. acidophilus [1, 2]. It thrives in anaerobic conditions and represents the major Lactobacillus species in the gut and plays a major role in maintaining a healthy bowel flora [1]. It is a non-spore-forming Gram-positive rod that is typically resistant to vancomycin and forms lactic acid from glucose [2]. In the food industry, it plays a role in fermentation of food products and is rarely pathogenic in humans [3]. Infectious cases reported in the literature cover a diverse span of clinical conditions including life-threatening conditions such as endocarditis [4], meningitis [5], splenic abscess [6], empyema and pneumonia [7], emphysematous pyelonephritis [8], peritonitis [9], and Fournier gangrene [2]. Many of the reported cases were associated with immunosuppressive conditions such as cancer, chemotherapy induced neutropenia, long term steroids, peritoneal dialysis, diabetes, transplantation, long term antibiotics, or postoperative complication. The most frequently associated infections with Lactobacillus are bacteremia and endocarditis, and L. casei and L. rhamnosus were most commonly encountered [10]. Infections by Lactobacillus gasseri are rarely reported in the literature. A case of Fournier gangrene [2], urinary tract infection [11], and polymicrobial empyema [7] were previously reported. In this case, we present the first monomicrobial Lactobacillus gasseri bilateral empyema that was successfully treated by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery along with chest tube placement and drainage. Identification of the Lactobacillus species was made using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry which was done at a reference laboratory [12]. Pneumonia and subsequent empyema were the two most fatal diseases encountered in ancient time [13]. Hippocrates is credited with both naming and inventing the surgical technique for proper management [13]. Empyema remains a serious medical condition with associated morbidity and mortality. Common pathogens that are encountered include Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, and anaerobes [14]. Despite the introduction of antibiotic therapy and the application of the scientific method to the modern practice of medicine when it comes to managing empyema, the core principle is still adequate drainage. The causative organism for his empyema is Lactobacillus gasseri as this was the only organism that was isolated from his pleural effusion cultures, along with his sputum culture; although Candida albicans was also isolated from his sputum sample, it likely reflects oral colonization. Prior to presentation, the patient had no prior antibiotic exposure and did not frequently seek medical care. The likely mechanism for this infection is aspiration in the setting of undiagnosed diabetes type 2 with Hgb A1c of 14.2%.

Globally, the incidence rate is 3.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The main risk factors are advanced age (> 65 years) and male gender [18]. Its etiology has changed locally and globally, largely due to the high incidence and prevalence of DM in the Western world [19, 20]. Clinical presentation is variable and can range from fever (89%), right upper quadrant abdominal pain (72%), chills (69%), nausea (43%), vomiting (32%), weight loss (26%), jaundice (21%), headache (17%), myalgia (11%), and diarrhea (10%). The frequency of liver abscesses complicated with septic shock ranges from 5.6\u201316% [21]. The most frequently isolated microorganisms are E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter, and multiple microaerophilic anaerobes (such as Streptococcus anginosus), therefore, empirical broad coverage of a probable polymicrobial infection is indicated. Other less frequent agents are Salmonella, Haemophilus, Yersinia, and Listeria [22]. Bacteria can invade the liver through ascending cholangitis, pylephlebitis (infection of the portal vein), the hepatic artery (secondary to bacteremia), contiguity of a nearby infectious process, or traumatic implants through the abdomen [23]. The first three mechanisms of invasion are compatible with the risk factors and characteristics of this patient. The mechanism by which the invasion of Lactobacillus is achieved remains unknown. A preponderant role in the pathophysiology of the disease is micro and macroangiopathy secondary to DM. Atherosclerotic lesions and advanced glycosylation products induce glycation of structural matrix proteins in cell basement membranes, increasing vascular permeability, responsible for endothelial injury and intestinal bacterial translocation [24]. During the diagnostic approach of this patient, exhaustive clinical reviews (dental, upper endoscopy, and echocardiography) were performed, without evidence of any predisposing lesion, except for the surgically modified biliodigestive anatomy. Liver abscesses caused by Lactobacillus strains have been reported even in the absence of relevant probiotic consumption [17] or hepatopancreatobiliary instrumentation [9, 12, 14]. Table \u200bTable11 shows Lactobacillus liver abscess cases reported in literature. It should be noted that in up to 40% of cases, it is not possible to demonstrate a cause and such cases remain cryptogenic [25]. Percutaneous or surgical drainage should be performed if an abscess is larger than 5 cm or in patients with persistent clinical symptoms and tenacious evidence of abscess on imaging. In eight of the ten reported cases, drainage, either percutaneous or surgical, was performed with excellent results and no fatal outcomes. There were no reported fatal outcomes in both extended series, but there was an increase in the hospital stay when compared to other causes of pyogenic liver abscess (mean of 48 days vs mean of 16 days) [3, 17].  Summary table of published Lactobacillus liver abscess cases M male, F female, DM Diabetes Mellitus, HTN Hypertension, CKD Chronic Kidney Disease, HCC Hepatocellular Carcinoma, N\/A Not available The exact strain was not identified Bacteremia and liver abscesses due to Lactobacillus are extremely rare. In a series from Finland, 89 cases of Lactobacillus bacteremia were identified. Of these, the species characterization of 47 were achieved; 25 being L. rhamnosus and 22 other species (L. fermentum 20%, L. casei 15%, L. gasseri, L. zeae). Immunosuppression, previous prolonged hospitalization, and previous surgical interventions were identified as independent risk factors [26]. Lactobacillus bacteremia implies a dark prognosis, with an associated mortality of 30% [25]. The clinical picture in the reported cases is similar to pyogenic liver abscesses caused by other microorganisms. Fever is nearly a rule, as well as abdominal pain or discomfort. Manifestations as tachycardia, fatigue, weakness, hyporexia, nausea, and vomiting are frequent, as well as local signs such as right upper quadrant tenderness and hepatomegaly. Less common manifestations for instance lower extremity atrophy, purpura fulminans, and right pleural effusion have been reported [10\u201314]. Regarding laboratory alterations, leukocytosis and neutrophilia have been present in all cases. Anemia is also habitual, reflecting the subacute nature of the condition, additionally to an elevation of acute phase reactants such as ESR, CRP, and ferritin. Thrombocytosis and alteration of liver chemistry with a predominantly cholestatic pattern may also be present. The antibiotic susceptibility of Lactobacilli is variable. The most commonly used regimens are penicillins (penicillin and ampicillin) with or without aminoglycosides. In a retrospective study of 200 cases of Lactobacillus spp infections, the most commonly used regimens included penicillin monotherapy (n = 35), penicillin therapy combined with aminoglycoside (n = 20), and cephalosporins in monotherapy (n = 16). Clindamycin (90.0%) and erythromycin (94.3%) had the highest sensitivity, meanwhile, penicillin had 63.6%. Vancomycin had the highest resistance rates (sensitive only in 22.5% of cases) [27]. Due to the rarity of infections caused by Lactobacilli, clinical experience and clinical trials on the preferred antimicrobial treatment regimens are lacking. Severe Lactobacillus infections are rare entities, and their uncertain significance implies a targeted search for risk factors capable of explaining the etiology, as in liver abscesses, where poorly controlled DM or hepatopancreatobiliary surgical manipulation are the main risk factors. Given the rising prevalence of population with risk factors for these kinds of infections, we should expect a rise in these cases; further study is needed to better understand risk factors, pathogenesis, and antibiotic susceptibility of Lactobacillus spp. bacteremia."}]}]},{"species":"Lactobacillus paracasei","docs":[{"title":"Lactobacilli from human gastrointestinal mucosa are strong stimulators of IL-12 production","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Lactobacillus paracasei normally exist?","id":"22-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"oral cavity, small and large intestine, and female genital tract","answer_start":170,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"The Lactobacillus genus is very heterogeneous, comprising around 70 recognized species and subspecies [1]. Lactobacilli are members of the normal indigenous flora of the oral cavity, small and large intestine, and female genital tract [2,3]. The Lactobacillus species which dominate on the human gastrointestinal mucosa are: L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. paracasei ssp. paracasei, which have been isolated from 52%, 26% and 17% of healthy individuals, respectively [3]. The same species seem to dominate in the oral cavity and in the intestine [3]. Lactobacilli can translocate, i.e. pass viable across the intestinal barrier [4\u20136]. Still, they rarely cause serious infection, except for rare cases in individuals with a pre-existing structural heart disease or severe immunodeficiency [7,8]. The capacity to translocate enables lactobacilli to influence cells of the immune system. Lactobacilli have also been used as probiotics, i.e. live bacterial food supplement aimed at, for example, improving certain immune effector functions. Both tumouricidal effects [9] and enhanced phagocytosis in man [10] and mice [11] have been attributed to the ingestion of lactobacilli. Lactobacilli can also function as adjuvants and vectors for vaccine delivery, promoting both cell-mediated immunity and antibody responses [12\u201315]. In vitro, several species of lactobacilli have been shown to trigger the release of IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) from human blood mononuclear cells, in amounts comparable to those induced by Escherichia coli [16]. Two important immunoregulatory cytokines produced by cells of the innate defence system in response to bacteria are IL-12 and IL-10. IL-12 stimulates interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) production from T cells and natural killer (NK) cells and increases their cytotoxicity [17]. Functional IL-12 is a heterodimer of 70 kD (p70) formed by the covalent assembly of two chains of approximate molecular weights of 40 kD (p40) and 35 kD (p35), respectively. The production of p70 and p40 are regulated independently [18]. An excess of p40 is produced, the function of which is unclear. The functions of IL-12 are in many aspects opposed by the cytokine IL-10, which has potent anti-inflammatory properties [19\u201321], abrogates the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 from T helper cells [22] and stimulates B cell growth and differentiation [23]. The secretion of IL-12 in response to certain stimuli is decreased in the presence of recombinant IL-10 [24]. In the present study we investigate the IL-12 and IL-10 response by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. paracasei isolated from oral or rectal mucosa of healthy volunteers. The responses are compared with those induced by E. coli."}]}]},{"species":"Lactobacillus casei","docs":[{"title":"Liver abscess and bacteremia caused by lactobacillus: role of probiotics?

The most common risk factors for lactobacilli infections that have been reported in the literature are diabetes mellitus, pre-existing structural heart disease (in infective endocarditis cases), cancer (especially leukemia), total parenteral nutrition use, broad spectrum antibiotic use, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, chemotherapy, neutropenia, organ transplantation (especially liver transplantation), HIV infection and steroids use [1\u201314].

The antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacilli is variable. The most common regimens that have been used to treat lactobacilli are high dose penicillin and ampicillin with or without aminoglycosides. In a retrospective study of 45 cases of lactobacilli bacteremia, the bacteria were susceptible to ampicillin (100%), penicillin (96%), clindamycin (100%), erythromycin (100%), and gentamycin (67%), with high resistance rate to vancomycin (73% were resistant) [5].

Besides protecting the nutritional quality, Lactobacillus strains were used for protecting the fermented food from various fungal pathogens. Many beneficial species of Lactobacillus strains were derived from the fermented food and other silage samples. The routine microbiological identification methods and 16S rRNA gene amplification followed by sequencing identified the strain as L. plantarum (Arasu et al., 2013). The physiological and biochemical identification study showed that the strain was catalase negative, Gram positive (Fig. 1). This novel strain was tolerant to a different range of salts especially NaCl and bile salts, pH of 4.0\u20138.0, temperatures of 28\u201345 \u00b0C, and with optimum cell growth at a temperature of 37 \u00b0C and pH 7.0 respectively. Similar to the literature the identified strain survived various biological barriers such as low pH, lytic enzymes, and bile salts in the upper GI tract (Vijayakumar et al., 2015). Carbohydrate assimilation test concluded that the strain was able to utilize a wide range of sugars especially monosaccharide\u2019s and disaccharides respectively. Moreover, the production of extracellular enzymes such as amylase and protease was to its advantage. The above mentioned results were commonly observed in L. plantarum strains. Micro-morphological image of Lactobacillus plantarum strain. The bile salt tolerance level of the Lactobacillus strains was induced by the expression of proteins such as GshR4, Cfa2, Bsh1, OpuA, and AtpH (Hamon et al., 2011). Besides the tolerance level, the antagonistic properties of the novel Lactobacillus strains are important to prevent the spreading of the intestinal infections. In general, the probiotic Lactobacillus strains exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against various GI tract pathogens. The antimicrobial properties of the strains were mainly related to the secretion of the extracellular metabolites such as lactic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, and bacteriocins. Literature claimed that L. plantarum strains were widely studied for their applications in the medical field (Table 1). Especially, these strains were reported to posses the down regulation of the risk of cardiovascular diseases (Ahren et al., 2014), produce pro-inflammatory cytokines in the intestinal epithelial cells (Murofushi et al., 2015), produce varied concentrations of exopolysaccharide with anticancer property (Wang et al., 2014), reduce kidney stones (Sasikumar et al., 2014), enhance splenocytes in dendritic cells (Ku et al., 2014) and reduce the cholesterol level in the adipose tissue (Li et al., 2014. Recently, Ilavenil et al. (2015) claimed that the phenyl lactic acid recovered from L. plantarum promotes adipogenic activity in 3T3-L1. Interestingly, L. plantarum significantly induces mucosal, humoral and cellular immune responses (Shi et al., 2014) and protects against symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (Stevenson et al., 2014). It inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as NF-\u03baB and suppresses atherosclerotic plaque inflammation (Kim et al., 2013) and induces the enhanced production of cytokines in the human intestine (Salah et al., 2012). On the other hand, L. plantarum strains are mainly involved in the T-cell differentiation thereby improving immune responses toward antigens (Vissers et al., 2010) and preventing dermatitis by increment of type 1 helper T cell activation and regulatory T cell activation (Won et al., 2012).

Although lactobacilli are generally considered non-pathogenic microbes and some of their strains are utilized as probiotics to prevent and treat some infections, they have been implicated in some serious clinical infections including bacteremia, infective endocarditis, intra-abdominal abscess including liver abscess, pancreatic necrosis infection, pulmonary infections, pyelonephritis, meningitis, postpartum endometritis, and chorioamnionitis [1\u201314]. The most common risk factors for lactobacilli infections that have been reported in the literature are diabetes mellitus, pre-existing structural heart disease (in infective endocarditis cases), cancer (especially leukemia), total parenteral nutrition use, broad spectrum antibiotic use, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, chemotherapy, neutropenia, organ transplantation (especially liver transplantation), HIV infection and steroids use [1\u201314]. The most common predisposing events are dental manipulation, poor dental hygiene, intravenous drug abuse, abdominal surgery, colonoscopy, probiotics use, and heavy dairy product consumption [1\u201312]. The antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacilli is variable. The most common regimens that have been used to treat lactobacilli are high dose penicillin and ampicillin with or without aminoglycosides. In a retrospective study of 45 cases of lactobacilli bacteremia, the bacteria were susceptible to ampicillin (100%), penicillin (96%), clindamycin (100%), erythromycin (100%), and gentamycin (67%), with high resistance rate to vancomycin (73% were resistant) [5]. Due to rarity of the infections with this microbe, clinical experience and studies are lacking regarding the best antibiotic regimens. The incidence of serious infections caused by lactobacilli is generally uncommon and rare with liver abscess with only 7 reported cases in the literature [14\u201320]. A previous case of liver abscess caused by a lactobacillus strain (indistinguishable from the strain used in food preparation) has been reported. In that case, there was a four month history of excessive dairy products consumption before the development of liver abscess with no use of probiotics. The association between liver abscess and use of probiotics containing lactobacilli has not been reported previously [19]. In this paper, we describe a case of liver abscess due to lactobacillus strain in an elderly diabetic woman with end stage renal disease after using probiotics containing lactobacilli in a course of treatment of Clostridium difficile colitis and review the literature.

Three days later, he consulted the emergency room as the hand was red and swollen, corresponding to a large circular area around the wound. A sample for culture was obtained from the wound, and the patient started treatment with oral dicloxacillin, 1 g four times a day. Eight days after the bite, the patient was admitted to the hospital because of thoracic pain and general malaise. His medical history included prior heroin addiction but also lung cancer which had been treated surgically 2 years earlier with left pneumonectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. The wrist was still showing signs of inflammation with a 2- by 4-cm area around the bite wound covered with pus. The left forearm was red, swollen, and warm. The patient was not febrile (37.3\u00b0C). The white blood cell count showed neutrophilic leukocytosis (13.8 \u00d7 10\/liter). The C-reactive protein level was 42 mg\/liter (reference interval, <10 mg\/liter). Pasteurella multocida, susceptible to penicillin, was recovered from the sample obtained in the emergency room 5 days earlier. An additional wound swab was obtained from the patient upon admission to the hospital along with two sets of blood cultures (40 ml total), each set including an aerobic and an anaerobic bottle (Bactec Plus aerobic\/F and anaerobic\/F; Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Instrument Systems, Franklin Lakes, NJ). At this time, intravenous treatment with benzylpenicillin, 1 million units four times a day, was initiated and treatment with oral dicloxacillin was discontinued. Growth was detected in one of the anaerobic bottles after 3 days of incubation. Gram staining revealed a Gram-negative rod. Material was subcultured according to routine practice on different media (9). Forty-eight hours later, growth was observed under anaerobic conditions only. Colonies were large (>2 mm), circular, dome shaped, mucoid, and beige. Growth was not inhibited by kanamycin, vancomycin, bile, or colistin. The isolate was identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (MicroSeq 500 system; Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems Division, Foster City, CA), as Bacteroides pyogenes\/Bacteroides suis with a 99.80% match for both species. The consensus sequence (493 bp) was also compared with the EzTaxon server (4). The highest sequence similarity (99.8%) was obtained with Bacteroides pyogenes strain JCM 6294 (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AB200229\",\"term_id\":\"67906135\",\"term_text\":\"AB200229\"}}AB200229). The second best match was with the Bacteroides tectus strain JCM 10003 (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AB200228\",\"term_id\":\"67906134\",\"term_text\":\"AB200228\"}}AB200228), with a sequence similarity of 99.6%. To identify the blood culture isolate further and to try to differentiate between B. pyogenes and B. suis\/B. tectus, we examined the phenotypic characteristics of the blood culture isolate using commercially available substrates and diagnostic tablets\/disks (Statens Serum Institut Diagnostica, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Rosco Diagnostica, Taastrup, Denmark) (Table 1). Using the identification table in a recent paper by Sakamoto et al. (10), the isolate was identified as B. pyogenes. The isolate differed from B. tectus and B. suis by producing \u03b2-glucosidase and by fermenting mannose, respectively (Table 1). The biochemical characteristics were also determined by the API Rapid ID 32A anaerobe identification system (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) according to manufacturer's instructions. The positive reactions were \u03b1-galactosidase, \u03b2- galactosidase, \u03b2-galactosidase 6-phosphate, \u03b1-glucosidase, N-acetyl-\u03b2-glucosaminidase, alkaline phosphatase, leucyl glycine arylamidase, alanine arylamidase, \u03b1-fucosidase, and glutamyl glutamic acid arylamidase. As B. pyogenes, B. tectus, and B. suis are not in the API database, the system was unable to identify the isolate to the species level. The closest match was Bacteroides capillosus (recently reassigned to Pseudoflavonifractor capillosus), with a 66.2% score.  Phenotypic characteristics of Bacteroides pyogenes, B. suis, and B. tectus The swab from the wound obtained upon admission revealed growth of Pasteurella multocida. After the initial handling, the swab was stored at 5\u00b0C in Stuart transport medium. When Bacteroides pyogenes was recovered from the blood culture, the swab was reexamined and cultured under anaerobic conditions and an identical isolate was retrieved. 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed identity match with the blood isolate. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of the blood culture isolate of B. pyogenes to six different antimicrobial agents were determined by the Etest gradient method (bioM\u00e9rieux, Lyon, France) on brucella blood agar supplemented with hemin and vitamin K (Becton Dickinson GmbH, BD Diagnostics, Heidelberg, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. A test with a nitrocefin disk for the detection of \u03b2-lactamase production was negative (Cefinase; Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD). The isolate was susceptible to penicillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, metronidazole, and clindamycin according to the interpretive categories proposed by the CLSI (M11-A7) for anaerobic bacteria (5). Bacteroides pyogenes has previously been shown to be highly susceptible to penicillin (3). The patient needed surgery because the tissue surrounding the wound was necrotic and had to be excised. Several revisions of the hand and wrist were necessary. The healing process was facilitated with vacuum-assisted closure treatment before the patient could be discharged 9 days later. The antimicrobial treatment consisted of intravenous benzylpenicillin for 9 days followed by oral phenoxymethylpenicillin for another 11 days. The patient was seen 3 weeks later in the outpatient clinic. The wound had healed, and there were apparently no functional sequelae. Animal bite wounds are often infected with bacteria from the animal's oral flora. The majority of bite wound infections are found to be mixed infections (11). While Pasteurella spp. have been shown to be the most frequent isolate from both dog bites (50%) and cat bites (75%) (11), anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides spp. may also play an important role in bite wound infections and can be isolated from approximately 40% of the infected wounds (7). B. pyogenes and B. tectus are two very closely related species within the Bacteroides genus. Both species have been isolated from the oral flora of dogs (6), while B. tectus has been isolated from cats as well (8). B. tectus has been reported to be transmitted to humans through dog and cat bites (1, 6, 11). However, wound infections caused by B. pyogenes in humans after cat bites have, to our knowledge, not been reported before. B. pyogenes and B. suis were proposed by Benno et al. in 1983 (2), while B. tectus was proposed by Love et al. in 1986 (8). The gene sequence similarity between B. pyogenes and B. suis has been shown by Sakamoto et al. (10) to be 100% for the hsp60 gene and 100% for the 16S rRNA gene. Sakamoto et al. investigated the physiological and biochemical characteristics of B. pyogenes, B. suis, and B. tectus and found that the three strains were phenotypically similar while the cellular fatty acid composition and the DNA G+C content varied only slightly. Sakamoto et al. concluded that B. suis and B. tectus are heterotypic synonyms of B. pyogenes (10). We found that only a few biochemical reactions separated B. pyogenes from B. suis\/B. tectus. Thus, the differentiation between these three Bacteroides spp. is difficult. To summarize, in this case report we have described what we believe to be the first case of bacteremia with Bacteroides pyogenes resulting from an infected cat bite. We would like to emphasize that since anaerobic bacteria play an important role in infected animal bite wounds, samples from the bite wounds should be cultured under anaerobic as well as aerobic conditions. Our case report also demonstrates the importance of species identification in cases of serious infections with Bacteroides spp., since suspected Bacteroides spp. from, e.g., blood cultures might easily be mistaken as originating from the gastrointestinal tract. In our case, species identification convincingly pointed toward origin from the cat bite. Although 16S rRNA gene sequencing is a powerful identification tool, even 16S rRNA gene sequencing fails to correctly differentiate between species when gene sequences are similar. We used biochemical reactions to assist us in separating B. pyogenes from B. suis and B. tectus and found the phenotypic characteristics to be compatible with B. pyogenes. However, by strict phenotypic identification alone according to the Manual of Clinical Microbiology (9) or by the API Rapid ID 32A anaerobe identification system, the isolate could very well be misidentified as Pseudoflavonifractor capillosus. Even so, P. capillosus has, to our knowledge, not been associated with animal bite wound infections."},{"qas":[{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of B. pyogenes?","id":"25-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":7707,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Bacteroides pyogenes sensitive to?","id":"25-1-3-2","answers":[{"text":"penicillin","answer_start":5326,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"A 60-year-old man was bitten by his cat in his left wrist.

Human infections with this organism are mainly due to animal bites [4]. Here, we report the first case of B. pyogenes isolated from the appendiceal abscess in a patient with no history of animal contact. A 79-year-old woman visited our hospital for lateral and lower right abdominal pain. The patient had previously undergone cholecystectomy and also lobectomy for right lower lung cancer. Her underlying diseases were high blood pressure and arrhythmia. On the first day of hospital visiting, the body temperature was 36.6 \u00b0C. Appendicitis was suspected by simple computed tomography (CT), and contrast CT indicated a rupture and abscess of the appendix. Blood tests showed an elevated leukocyte count (12.9 \u00d7 10\/L) with 82.8% neutrophils, an elevated level of C-reactive protein (CRP) (13.8 mg\/dL), and procalcitonin (0.04 ng\/dL). She was admitted, and treatment was initiated with antimicrobial agent Tazobactam\/Piperacillin (TAZ\/PIPC, 4.5 g\/6 h\/i.v.). A specimen of the appendiceal abscess obtained by intra-abdominal drainage was cultured under aerobic, 5% CO2, and anaerobic conditions. After 24\u201348 hours of incubation, a small number of colonies of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and a large number of colonies of Peptostreptococcus micros were observed on Trypticase Soy Agar with 5% Sheep Blood and PEA-added Anello Colombia RS Blood Agar\/BBE Agar. The anaerobic condition under 0% O2 was monitored using an anaerobic indicator. These bacteria were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS, Vitek MS system; bioM\u00e9rieux).

The antimicrobial was changed from TAZ\/PIPC to Amoxicillin (AMPC, 250 mg 3 times a day) and Amoxicillin\/Clavulanate (AMPC\/CVA, 250SR 3 times a day). Twelve days after admission, the patient was discharged. Human infections by B. pyogenes and related species have been mostly found as wound infections from dog or cat bites [4,7], and bacteremia with B. pyogenes resulting from a cat bite was also reported [8]. Nevertheless, there are a few reports without contact with animals for cases of joint infection [9] and bloodstream infection associated with liver abscess [10]. Similarly, in the present report, the patient had no history of evident contact with an animal, including cat, dog and cow; thus, this is probably the first case of B. pyogenes infection in the appendix without animal contact. Although, in our case, the transmission route of B. pyogenes from an animal is unclear, oral ingestion of the bacteria is possible because the infected site is the alimentary tract. Accurate identification by MALDI-TOF-MS, as well as gene sequencing, as shown in this report, is important to accumulate data to approach the real ecology of such rare pathogens, even if there is no relationship between the patient\u2019s background and the detected bacteria."}]}]},{"species":"Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron","docs":[{"title":"First isolation of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron from a patient with a cholesteatoma and experiencing meningitis","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can B. thetaiotaomicron cause?","id":"26-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"meningitis","answer_start":433,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"A 45-year-old man with a cholesteatoma experienced purulent meningitis.

Routine inoculation of CSF in anaerobic media yielded an isolate of the Bacteroides fragilis group, which was further unambiguously identified as B. thetaiotaomicron by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. B. thetaiotaomicron is a gram-negative, nonsporulated, anaerobic bacillus (11, 14). The genus Bacteroides represents one of the most important groups of human commensal anaerobes, which are constitutive of the normal floras of the gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, vagina, and respiratory tract (11, 14). Although anaerobes are less frequent components of the usual ear population (9), chronic otitis media, including the presence of a cholesteatoma, may lead to aeration impairment and the multiplication of commensal anaerobic flora (12), due to a decrease in local redox potential (7). Anaerobic bacteria are present in almost 50% of chronic otitis floras and 95% of cholesteatomas, where Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Bacteroides spp., and Fusobacterium spp. are predominant (2). Anaerobes may be implicated in various infectious diseases whenever they invade sterile body tissue and fluid (in particular, CSF) by hematogenous spreading or contiguous extension of their preferential living sites. Thus, Bacteroides meningitis has been described for patients with digestive bacterial proliferation directly breaking into subarachnoidal space (17) and for patients after the spread of ear infection (16). Meningitis occurring during ear infection may be difficult to diagnose. Indeed, nausea and fever may be present in the course of noncomplicated acute otitis and in the acute stage of chronic otitis, including that with a cholesteatoma. Moreover, meningeal syndrome and hyperthermia may be masked by previous antalgic, antibiotic, or antipyretic treatments. Finally, clinical features are usually misleading in children and the elderly (3, 18), the age groups in which the incidence of bacterial meningitis is highest (20). Meningitis should be suspected every time a patient suffering otitis experiences new symptoms (such as headache) or a worsening, sustainment, or recurrence of previous symptoms despite appropriate antibiotics; this suspicion should lead to the performance of lumbar puncture. In our patient, CSF examination revealed a purulent anaerobic meningitis. Anaerobic meningitis is thought to occur rarely (6, 14), so many clinical laboratories do not routinely inoculate CSF under an anaerobic atmosphere (14). Schlech and colleagues have determined an anaerobic-organism etiology for only 5 out of 18,642 cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States from 1977 to 1981 (19). However, systematic inoculation of CSF into both aerobic and anaerobic media led us to find an unexpected anaerobic-organism etiology for 17 out of 178 cases of bacterial meningitis from 1998 to 2002, most of them (76.5%) being Propionibacterium acnes or Propionibacterium spp. in patients with CSF-shunting devices or other organisms belonging to the Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, or Actinobacillus genera (L. Feuillet, unpublished data). The identification of anaerobes requires preliminary appropriate collection, transport, and culture of the CSF samples. The difficulties which may be encountered in fulfilling these conditions in clinical practice suggest that anaerobic-organism meningitis may remain underdiagnosed (16). Anaerobic culture performed in our case yielded a gram-negative bacillus belonging to the B. fragilis group. Although Bacteroides spp. are thought to be the main agents of anaerobic meningitis (13), fewer than 100 cases of Bacteroides meningitis have been reported in the English-language literature, and they occur primarily in the pediatric population (13). In most laboratories, Bacteroides identification currently relies on phenotypic tests (11). The second biochemical profile and the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern were here consistent with either B. thetaiotaomicron or B. ovatus infection. B. thetaiotaomicron and B. ovatus have each been reported once before as causing meningitis, but in those cases, both were isolated within a mixed flora (8, 17). The unique previous case of meningitis due to well-identified B. thetaiotaomicron occurred in association with B. distasonis and B. fragilis species in a woman who experienced bowel impaction (17). The unique previous case of B. ovatus meningitis was described to occur with the growth of Streptococcus intermedius in a 19-month-old female presenting with an occult congenital dermal sinus communicating with an intraspinal infected dermoid cyst (8). We found neither relevant bowel dysfunction in our patient's medical history nor a cutaneous opening overlying the spine but rather a cholesteatoma. Although the cholesteatoma was destructive, invading the deep petrous bone structures (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1),1), the relationship between the patient's chronic ear infection and his meningitis could not be definitively assessed. Indeed, we did not collect the purulent sample from ear discharge because both aerobic and anaerobic cultures might have displayed various commensal floras instead of the real etiological agent of meningitis, potentially leading to a false-positive identification (16). Moreover, we report here the first case of B. thetaiotaomicron meningitis in pure culture. Since bacterial proliferation is often polymorphic in chronic otitis (1), and with cholesteatoma in particular, meningitis of mixed etiologies might also have occurred in our patient as described previously after digestive contamination (17). Although conventional biochemical tests are well established and standardized for the identification of anaerobes in particular (10), they remain labor-intensive, time-consuming, and cumbersome (7). Inexpensive and rapid identification microsystems such as API-20A are best suited for fast-growing anaerobes, such as members of the B. fragilis group (7, 11). However, identification to the species level may be, as in our case, not precise enough and also may be incorrect or not possible (15). With various pathogenic conditions, genetic analysis may help in the identification of anaerobes (4). Moreover, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis has been found more reliable than phenotypic methods in accurate species-level identification (5). When the method is available, analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence is suggested to characterize the organism to the species level, since accurate and definitive identification should be obtained for isolates coming from blood, organs, or body cavities and CSF (11). 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis allowed us to finally identify the clinical isolate as B. thetaiotaomicron. B. thetaiotaomicron and B. ovatus were individualized in taxonomy as distinct species about 30 years ago. Since their first descriptions, misdiagnosis at the species level may be due to the exclusive use of phenotypic methods. In fact, further molecular investigative methods to characterize species might have been unavailable for most older reports or not used in more-recent ones when species identification was considered too expensive and\/or not relevant enough in clinical practice (11). We report on the first case of meningitis due to B. thetaiotaomicron as a unique etiological agent. Isolation has been made possible by the systematic inoculation of the CSF sample in anaerobic media. This isolate was further identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, illustrating the usefulness of this method for identification to the species level. This well-defined identification allowed us to describe the natural history and the clinical and biological features of our patient's meningitis and, finally, the antibiotic susceptibility of the etiologic agent, B. thetaiotaomicron."}]},{"title":"Identification of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron on the basis of an unexpected specific amplicon of universal 16S ribosomal DNA PCR","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether B. thetaiotaomicron is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"26-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-negative","answer_start":1723,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can B. thetaiotaomicron cause?","id":"26-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"peritonitis, septicemia, and wound infections","answer_start":1828,"id":1},{"text":"intra-abdominal sepsis and bacteremia","answer_start":2019,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of B. thetaiotaomicron?","id":"26-2-1-3","answers":[{"text":"intra-abdominal sepsis and bacteremia","answer_start":2019,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are B. thetaiotaomicron resistant to?","id":"26-2-1-4","answers":[{"text":"cephalosporins and clindamycin","answer_start":2206,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about B. thetaiotaomicron's requirement for oxygen?","id":"26-2-1-5","answers":[{"text":"anaerobic","answer_start":1713,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of B. thetaiotaomicron?","id":"26-2-1-6","answers":[{"text":"bacilli","answer_start":1737,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does B. thetaiotaomicron normally exist?","id":"26-2-1-7","answers":[{"text":"gastrointestinal tract","answer_start":1955,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Identification of pathogens in specimens usually depends on culture and various phenotypic tests. The phenotypic characteristics of clinical isolates, which are used for conventional identification, are not always typical and may lead to ambiguous results (2). Many new methods based on molecular techniques for the rapid and direct identification of microorganisms in specimens have been developed. Direct sequencing of the PCR-amplified bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is one of these new molecular identification methods, and it has been widely used (4, 7, 13, 15). The 16S rRNA genes of almost all common bacterial pathogens have been sequenced and are highly conserved among these bacteria. Consequently, the 16S rRNA gene is commonly selected as the target for universal PCR that amplifies partial or nearly full-length 16S rDNA sequences in almost all bacterial pathogens. Many sets of primers have been designed to amplify different regions of 16S rDNA and have been shown to have various sensitivities and specificities. A universal PCR with primers RW01 and DG74A was developed, and it was demonstrated to be a sensitive screening method for detection of bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (4). This set of universal primers amplified a portion of 16S rDNA (369 bp in Escherichia coli) (4), and it was applied to the identification of bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens. However, we found that an unexpected amplicon (547 bp), in addition to the expected 362-bp product, constantly appeared in samples containing Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron are clinically important because they are the first and second most common agents of infections caused by anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, respectively (1, 3, 8). They are opportunistic pathogens commonly associated with peritonitis, septicemia, and wound infections (3, 8). Although B. thetaiotaomicron is part of the indigenous microflora of the gastrointestinal tract, it may cause serious infections such as intra-abdominal sepsis and bacteremia (1, 3, 8). B. thetaiotaomicron is resistant to many antimicrobial agents; for example, it has been reported to be more resistant than B. fragilis to cephalosporins and clindamycin (1, 9, 10, 12). Therefore, rapid and accurate identification of B. thetaiotaomicron in clinical specimens is important, and it may help physicians make rational, rapid choices with respect to antibiotic therapy. In order to establish if we could identify B. thetaiotaomicron on the basis of the detection of this additional PCR product, we performed the tests described here."}]},{"title":"Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in posthysterectomy infection","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron cause?","id":"26-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"vaginal posthysterectomy infection","answer_start":49,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron sensitive to?","id":"26-3-1-2","answers":[{"text":"amoxicillin associated with clavulanic acid, metronidazole, and the newer fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin","answer_start":340,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron resistant to?","id":"26-3-1-3","answers":[{"text":"piperacillin-tazobactam and cefoxitin","answer_start":273,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" We report a patient with clinically significant vaginal posthysterectomy infection due to Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.

Nocardia species are aerobic, gram-positive, branching, and filamentous bacteria, and can be introduced into a host through inhalation.

Infection due to N. brasiliensis is rare compared with that due to other species, which generally results from direct traumatic inoculation into the skin and hematogenous spread from the primary location to the central nervous system where a brain abscess is formed. However, rare cases of meningitis or spinal abscess caused by N. brasiliensis have also been reported [8]. The clinical course of brain abscess caused by Nocardia is typically gradual, with symptoms presenting over months or even years. Imaging evidence contributes to identifying brain abscesses in the cases of tumors and cystic or necrotic foci. The abscess usually develops a vascularized wall composed of astrocytes and glia that can be identified by CT scan or MRI as a ring enhancement depending on the capsular phase [9]. During the development of brain abscess, three stages of infections (meningoencephalitis stage; suppuration, and capsule stages) can be distinguished on the basis of evidence from brain imaging [10, 11]. The cranial CT scan and MRI data from the patient\u2019s first hospital visit both revealed a ring enhancement. However, this ring enhancement was not obvious on the scans of his recurrent abscess. The reason for the abscess of the ring enhancement in subsequent scans might be that the abscess and edema formed relatively slowly, and there was some compensation for elevated cranial pressure during this process. If the patient\u2019s headache appeared at a comparatively later stage, there would have been enough time for the lesion to form a vascularized before the patient visited the hospital for the first time. However, it is easier for the brain tissue with prior vasogenic edema to form edema again; further, the compensation for elevated cranial pressure is relatively weak, both of which may have led to earlier presentation of the headache, explaining why patient presented at the hospital sooner the second time. In the capsule stage, brain abscesses are similar to gliomas and cystic or necrotic foci on imaging modalities and require further tests for differential diagnosis. MRS is a useful method for distinguishing between brain abscess, gliomas, and cystic or necrotic foci [10] . The center of a brain abscess lacks the metabolites of normal brain tissue; therefore, the peaks of NAA, creatine, and choline are low but the level of lactic acid is elevated. In addition, the signals of valine, leucine, and isoleucine are important markers for diagnosing brain abscess; however, the absence of the three amino acids does not exclude the presence of brain abscess [12, 13]. In our report, MRS displayed an elevated lactic acid peak and low NAA, creatine, and choline peaks. Diffusion-weighted imaging is also a valuable method to distinguish between brain abscess, brain glioma, and brain metastases. The abscess cavity manifests as a hyper-intense signal on T1-weighted FLAIR and has a low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). By contrast, a cystic or necrotic area of a brain tumor usually displays hypo-intense signals on T1-weighted FLAIR and high ADC values [2]. In our report, the hyper-intense signal on T1-weighted FLAIR and a low ADC values were found in the first time scan, but were not apparent in the recurrent brain abscess scans. We presume that this was because the abscess development had not fully reached the capsule stage in the recurrent episode. Brain abscess diagnosis is mainly based on bacteriological cultures from pus [14]. In our case, we punctured aspirated pus and relieved cranial pressure. Bacteriological cultures indicated N. brasiliensis infection that was sensitive to amikacin and ceftriaxone. We continued to administer amikacin and ceftriaxone treatment for10 days after surgery the patient was discharged. Standard medical treatment for Nocardia brain abscess is trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole; accordingly, we prescribed oral trimethoprim to the patient for three months. However, three months after discharge, the abscess recurred and the patient returned to the hospital. Surgical treatment options for brain abscess include craniotomy excision and puncture aspiration. Craniotomy for excision of the entire abscess and capsule is more effective than aspiration. During our patient\u2019s first admission to the hospital, we performed puncture aspiration surgery to treat the abscess, but the capsule wall was left. Retention of the capsule is an important factor in recurrence, when we performed a craniotomy to fully clear both the abscess and capsule at the patient\u2019s second admission to the hospital, there was no further recurrence at one year of follow up. We found that the abscess capsule was located near the original lesion and there were multiple additional lesions. Multiple abscesses are found in 38% of patients with brain abscess due to Nocardia infection [15]. In our case, the abscess was single in his first admission to hospital. It is also possible that treatment time with intravenous antibiotics was inadequate after the first surgery and contributed to recurrence. Patients with brain abscess should receive intravenous antibiotics for 4\u20136 weeks, and administration of antibiotics should be maintained until the patient\u2019s postoperative body temperature has remained within a normal rang for 10\u201314 days [10]. In the present case, the patient received only 10 days of intravenous antibiotics owing to his strong desire to be discharged. It should be noted that, for an immunosuppressed patient, 6\u201312 months of antibiotic treatment is required to prevent recurrence and increased risk of mortality [16]. After his second surgery to treat the brain abscess recurrence, our non-immunocompromised patient had received intravenous antibiotics for four weeks and continued to take oral trimethoprim for three months. At the time of the postoperative follow up at one year, there was no further recurrence. In conclusion, brain abscess caused by N. brasiliensis in non-immunocompromised individuals is rare. In the present case, craniotomy for abscess excision was a more effective surgical method than aspiration. Complete excision of the abscess capsule was an efficient precaution against recurrence. It is necessary to choose antibiotics according to drug sensitivity tests results, and to ensure adequate duration of intravenous treatment for 4\u20136 weeks and until postoperative body temperature has remained within a normal rang level for 10\u201314 days. It is also essential for the patient to continue to take oral antibiotics (trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole) for at least 3 months after discharge."}]},{"title":"Nocardia brasiliensis-associated femorotibial osteomyelitis","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Nocardia brasiliensis cause?","id":"27-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"femorotibial osteomyelitis","answer_start":21,"id":1},{"text":"bone infections","answer_start":111,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" We report a case of femorotibial osteomyelitis due to Nocardia brasiliensis.

The lesions occur predominantly within the alveolar areas, but sometimes there is associated compromise of the bronchial lumen. The pathological pattern is not specific for any disorder or cause but reflects an inflammatory process secondary to lung injury; however, it is the particular hallmark of a recognized clinic-radiological entity known as an cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, when etiology cannot be established [3, 4]. This entity is characterized by good response to steroid therapy, but some cases especially those with reticulation on high resolution CT or with fibrosing variant pathologic type can be refractory to this therapy. In these cases, steroid sparing immunosuppressive therapy using cyclosporine or azathioprine may be utilized, but the benefit of this has been not clearly established [5, 6]. As a potential opportunistic pathogen, Nocardia species is prevalent in populations that have compromised cell-mediated immunity. The immunocompetence of the host determines the rate and course of infection [7]. High-dose prolonged corticosteroid therapy is a known independent risk factor for infection with Nocardia because it suppresses TH1 cellular immunity [7, 8]. Most cases of disseminated or pulmonary nocardiosis are associated with Nocardia asteroides and have also been previously described to be associated with COP. Structural alternations seen with chronic pulmonary disease, such as COP in this case, increase the likelihood of pulmonary colonization by Nocardia and can present as acute, subacute, or chronic pneumonia [7]. In this case, the patient acquired nocardiosis most likely through direct cutaneous inoculation, given a facial laceration after a fall outdoors and a tissue culture showing N. brasiliensis, which is the most common cause of cutaneous nocardiosis. As these lesions developed after treatment for progressive dyspnea, we postulate the degree of iatrogenic immunosuppression was permissive for hematogenous dissemination of the Nocardia to the lung. While the respiratory tract is typically the main entry point for these organisms, dissemination of Nocardia can occur from either a pulmonary or a cutaneous source to any organ [9]. In immunocompetent hosts, primary cutaneous nocardiosis rarely disseminates and generally presents with localized pustules or as a small abscess that may ulcerate. In immunocompromised hosts, hematogenous spread to lung, liver, and central nervous system is a possible complication that can be fatal [7] and multiple relapsing cutaneous pustular lesions are commonly observed.  Nocardia does not belong to normal human flora and is seldom a contaminant in tissue culture [7]. It is found in soil, decaying plants, and dust particles [10]. Cultures are slow to grow and are at risk of being overgrown by bacterial containments, thereby leading to false-negative findings [11]. Gram stain has the highest sensitivity for detection of Nocardia in tissue [12]. The bacterium appears as gram-positive, beaded, branching, filamentous rods that are uniquely and weakly acid-fast positive. This staining combination can suggest Nocardia as a possible cause even before speciation by culture is available. Use of modified acid-fast stains, such as Kinyoun stain, also improves visualization [12]. Sulfonamides are frequently a component in the empirical treatment of nocardiosis [13]. However, sulfonamide monotherapy has been associated with increased mortality rate in some reports, and therefore combination therapy should be considered for extensive and disseminated cases [7]. One recommended approach is an initial regimen of TMP\/SMX in combination with a fluoroquinolone, but alternative treatments also use minocycline, imipenem, linezolid, third-generation cephalosporins, dapsone, erythromycin, clindamycin, and amikacin [7, 8, 11, 13], either alone or in combination. Final therapy ultimately should be tailored to the sensitivity panel from culture. In current literature, consensus on duration and dosage is poor, but the immune status of the patient is likely important [7]. Previous case studies have suggested 3-month treatment for immunocompetent patients and 6 months for immunocompromised patients [12]. The prognosis of localized nocardiosis is favorable; however, disseminated nocardiosis can be fatal, especially with central nervous system involvement [12]. Therefore, consideration of nocardiosis as a diagnostic factor is important for immunocompromised patients, especially those with preexisting pulmonary disease and a history of relapsing skin lesions. Treating physicians should be aware that the failure of corticosteroids to improve COP, especially in the setting of other immunosuppressive medications, may reflect a secondary iatrogenic infection requiring specific antibiotic therapy."}]}]},{"species":"Nocardia otitidiscaviarum","docs":[{"title":"Severe pneumonia due to Nocardia otitidiscaviarum identified by mass spectroscopy in a cotton farmer: A case report and literature review","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can N otitidiscaviarum cause?","id":"28-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"pneumonia","answer_start":205,"id":1},{"text":"pneumonia","answer_start":254,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Nocardia otitidiscaviarum?","id":"28-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"bacilli","answer_start":41,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Nocardia otitidiscaviarum's requirement for oxygen?","id":"28-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"aerobic","answer_start":21,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Nocardia species are aerobic saprophytic bacilli.

In spite of the fact that nocardiosis are being increasingly recognized, infections due to N otitidiscaviarum, comprising about only 0.3% to 2.9% of all Nocardia infections, remain infrequently reported. Beaman et al described that only 10 cases from 347 patients infected by Nocardia in United States were identified as N otitidiscaviarum infection. Similarly, Kageyama et al reported that out of more than 303 pathogenic Nocardia strains isolated from nocardiosis patients in Japan from 1992 to 2001, only 14 were identified as N otitidiscaviarum. This low incidence of N otitidiscaviarum may be attributed to its lower prevalence in the environment when compared with other Nocardia species, although it has been found to be native to the soil. In this case, the cotton farmer had intimate contact with the soil, which increased the risk for N. otitidiscaviarum infection. Noticeably, N otitidiscaviarum has been described as an opportunistic pathogen in human. However, it has been reported in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals to be a cause of pulmonary, primary cutaneous, and lymphocutaneous infections. Individuals with weakened immune system, such as patients suffering from diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mixed connective tissue disorder, ulcerative colitis, cirrhosis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, malignancies, those receiving long-term or large dose of corticosteroid therapy, and bone marrow or solid organ transplant, are at higher risk. In this case, the patient has no immunocompromised disorders, but 10 pack-years smoking history, which could be a risk factor to weaken the defense capability in lungs. Being relatively rarely reported, N otitidiscaviarum is postulated to be less pathogenic in human when compared with other Nocardia species. However, contradictory results have been yielded from animal studies of nocardial virulence. Smith and Hayward reported that N otitidiscaviarum and N asteroids were of similar virulence; Mishra et al confirmed that the 2 species were of equal pathogenicity and were both markedly more virulent than N brasiliensis. It is likely that the pathogenicity of N otitidiscaviarum varies due to different strain variability, inoculum size, and infection route. Moreover, human infections by N otitidiscaviarum usually occur in 2 major forms, the pulmonary form (through direct inhalation of pathogen or bacteria fragments carried in dust or spores) and the cutaneous form (following injection by a thorn prick or similar accidents). There has not been any case report of human-to-human or animal-to-human transmission. Obviously, this case prefers the pulmonary form. With signs, symptoms, and imaging features being not pathognomonic, it is challenging to clinically diagnose N otitidiscaviarum infection. Conventional evaluation of specimens like sputum samples, abscesses, wound drainages, or bronchial washings by smear and culture remains the principal method of diagnosis. Yet, it is noteworthy that almost 1 week or even more may be needed for the presence of N otitidiscaviarum to be noted on cultures on routine bacteriologic media because of its slow growth. However, relative to the conventional methods, polymerase chain reaction and 16S rDNA sequencing, or mass spectroscopy used in this case are much more rapid precise, and accurate in identifying N otitidiscaviarum. N otitidiscaviarum infection calls for long-course drug treatment, and it is suggested that antibiotic therapy should be continued for 6 months in immunocompetent patients and up to a year in immunosuppression. Although increasing numbers of Nocardia species including N otitidiscaviarum complex have developed increasing resistance and demonstrated inconsistent susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, sulfonamides remain the standard antimicrobial agents for the treatment of nocardiosis to date. Most N otitidiscaviarum isolates are also reported to be resistant to and beta-lactams like ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and imipenem, but are usually susceptible to amikacin and the fluoroquinolones. Meanwhile, some other studies have shown that N otitidiscaviarum complex is proved to be sensitive to linezolid in vitro; however, data from in vivo studies are lacking. In addition, incidence of hematological toxicity become higher after 4 weeks of linezolid application, and clinical experience with linezolid is limited. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing can guide the treatment of N otitidiscaviarum, and the US National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards approved an antimicrobial testing of aerobic actinomycetes including Nocardia by using broth microdilution. Although the optimal treatment protocol of N otitidiscaviarum still unknown, a combination of sulfonamides and amikacin with a carbapenem or a 3rd-generation cephalosporin are suggested for severe or disseminated infections. Similarly in this case, combined therapy (amikacin, imipenem, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) was administered in accordance with the sensitivity test on the 6th hospital day after N otitidiscaviarum was identified. However, the mortality rate in pulmonary nocardiasis patients is 15% to 30%, even in severe patients up to 50%. So, early diagnosis and prompt initiation of treatment are of vital importance in Nocardia infection. In this case, overdelayed diagnosis and intervention definitely attributes to the eventual death. In conclusion, N otitidiscaviarum infection is rarely reported and requires early diagnosis and prompt intervention. Considering the high rate of mortality, long-course treatment with optimal protocol is desperately needed."}]},{"title":"Disseminated nocardiosis caused by Nocardia otitidiscaviarum in an immunocompetent host: A case report and literature review","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of drugs are N. otitidiscaviarum resistant to?","id":"28-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"cephalosporin","answer_start":1962,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are N. otitidiscaviarum sensitive to?","id":"28-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole","answer_start":1581,"id":1},{"text":"aminoglycoside","answer_start":1652,"id":2},{"text":"TMP-SMX and aminoglycoside","answer_start":1904,"id":3},{"text":"sulfonamide with minocycline","answer_start":609,"id":4}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"The aim of the present study was to summarize the clinical characteristics of nocardiosis caused by Nocardia otitidiscaviarum in order to improve the knowledge of nocardiosis.

Informed consent for publication of this case report was provided by the patient. The present patient was a young immunocompetent man suffering from disseminated nocardiosis induced by infection with N. otitidiscaviarum. Following a poor response to \u03b2-lactam antibiotic, a combination of sulfonamide with minocycline was administered, which successfully ameliorated the symptoms. Previous studies published in English were retrieved from PubMed with \u2018Nocardia otitidiscaviarum\u2019 used as the search keyword. A total of 23 articles were retrieved from the PubMed database, supporting the assertion that N. otitidiscaviarum is a rare Nocardia species. Among these 23 cases, there were 11 cases of lymphocutaneous (48%), 5 of pulmonary (22%), 2 of brain (9%) and 1 of pyothorax (4%) infection, and 4 cases of disseminated infections (17%). Analysis of the immune state of these patients demonstrated that 9 were immunocompetent (39%), 7 of whom had cutaneous infections (30%) with a predominant history of trauma (6\/7), and 14 were immunosuppressed, 9 of whom were treated with prednisolone. Microbiology and histopathology were necessary in all cases for definite diagnosis. Among the 13 cases who underwent drug susceptibility testing, 10 cases were sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and 12 cases were sensitive to aminoglycoside. In conclusion, although N. otitidiscaviarum is one of the less commonly isolated species of Nocardia, it is capable of inducing localized or disseminated infection, even in an immunocompetent host.

These 23 cases included 11 cases of subcutaneous and soft tissue involvement, 5 patients with pulmonary involvement, 2 cases of brain involvement, 1 case of pyothorax involvement, 1 case of subcutaneous, soft tissue and lung involvement, 1 case of subcutaneous, soft tissue and brain involvement, 1 case of pyothorax and brain involvement, and 1 case with chest wall abscesses, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and intra-abdominal mass involvement. The mean age of the patients was 56.61\u00b118.58 years, and there were 6 female and 17 male patients. Nine cases were immunocompetent patients, of which 7 cases presented with cutaneous infection; all but one of the patients with cutaneous infection had a history of trauma. The remaining two cases presented with lung infections with no history of trauma. A total of 14 cases were immunosuppressed patients, including the following conditions: Rheumatoid joints (n=3); acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS; n=2); intravenous drug use (n=1); renal transplantation (n=1); heart transplantation (n=1); asthma (n=1); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n=1); diabetes mellitus and thrombocytopenia (n=1); sickle cell anemia and chronic renal insufficiency (n=1); diabetes mellitus and renal transplantation (n=1); and tuberculosis and chronic respiratory infection (n=1). Among these immunosuppressed patients, 9 patients were treated with corticosteroids (9\/14); the exceptions were 2 cases of AIDS, 1 case of intravenous drug abuse, 1 case of sickle cell anemia and chronic renal insufficiency and 1 case of tuberculosis and chronic respiratory infection. Among the 23 cases, 13 patients underwent drug susceptibility testing, which demonstrated that 77% of cases (10\/13) were sensitive to TMP-SMX, with the remaining 3 cases being resistant to TMP-SMX. Furthermore, 12 cases (12\/13) were sensitive to aminoglycoside and 12 cases (12\/13) were resistant to cephalosporin. Studies reviewed, including patient clinical characteristics. TMP-SMX, trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole; DM, diabetes, mellitus; AIDS, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. According to the site of infection, human nocardiosis can be clinically classified into nocardial mycetoma or pulmonary, extrapulmonary, central nervous system, cutaneous or subcutaneous nocardiosis (3). The present case is a patient who initially presented with a persistent cough (lasting 50 days) followed by a right cervical mass with no history of trauma. The diagnosis was primary lung infection caused by N. otitidiscaviarum. The patient had participated in carpentry work for 3 years and often had contact with soil and sawdust, and the infection may have been introduced into the respiratory tract via the inspiration of soil and\/or sawdust. Pulmonary nocardiosis is often associated with nocardia empyema, and it has been reported that N. otitidiscaviarum is capable of inducing empyema (11). Analysis of the right pleural effusion in the present case demonstrated that it was an exudate dominated by monocytes (pH 7.4) with 2.1 mmol\/l glucose. These results indicated that the pleural fluid was parapneumonic without empyema. It has previously been reported that Nocardia spp. are capable of causing disseminated disease that can readily enter the bloodstream and spread throughout the body, including the skin, lung, central nervous system and abdominal organs (3). Therefore, contrast-enhanced CT was performed, which detected a liver abscess, and cranial MRI demonstrated no structural disease. These results confirmed the diagnosis of disseminated nocardiosis of the subcutaneous soft tissue, lungs and liver. N. otitidiscaviarum was first isolated in 1924 by Snijders (26). Gordon and Mihm were the first to define the biochemical criterion for its identification and distinguish it from other Nocardia species (27). Although the name Nocardia caviae was originally proposed, the organism is currently known as N. otitidiscaviarum, as defined in Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (28). Although primary nocardiosis may be induced by infection with any Nocardia spp., N. brasiliensis is isolated from the majority of cases (~80%) (29). In a study conducted in the USA, only 2.9% (10\/347) of infections due to Nocardia were identified as N. otitidiscaviarum (30). In Germany, Nocardia spp. were isolated in 131 patients at a national reference laboratory between 1979 and 1991, with only 8 patients having N. otitidiscaviarum infections (31). Therefore N. otitidiscaviarum causes fewer infections than other species of Nocardia. This low incidence has been attributed to reduced pathogenicity or its lower prevalence in soil (32). Tan et al (33) retrospectively reviewed the laboratory records of the Bacteriology Laboratory at National Taiwan University Hospital between January 1998 and June 2008 and discovered that the major types of Nocardia infection were cutaneous infection (56.6%), pulmonary infection (33.6%) and disseminated infection (7.1%). Therefore, disseminated nocardiosis is a rare disease. It has also been demonstrated that disseminated systemic infection arises in the respiratory tract and is usually associated with N. asteroides, in both healthy and immunocompromised hosts, although immunocompromised patients have a greater tendency to develop pulmonary or disseminated disease (34). The present patient was a healthy host with disseminated nocardiosis caused by N. otitidiscaviarum, which is rare. To the best of our knowledge, the present case report is the first to describe a case of disseminated nocardiosis of the subcutaneous soft tissue, lungs and liver, caused by N. otitidiscaviarum in an immunocompetent host. The present report is also the first to summarize the literature concerning the clinical characteristics of N. otitidiscaviarum from 1990 to 2014, to the best of our knowledge. The present literature review demonstrated that subcutaneous and soft tissue were the most common sites of infection with N. otitidiscaviarum (14\/23 cases). Amongst the 23 cases retrieved, 39% of the patients were immunocompetent (9\/23). The majority of cases of primary cutaneous nocardiosis in healthy patients had a history of local trauma (5\/9 cases). Three immunocompetent patients presented with primary lung infection with no history of trauma, and may have become infected by exposure to soil, although N. otitidiscaviarum has a lower prevalence in soil, as compared with other Nocardia spp. These 3 cases involved only the lungs, and were not disseminated infections; therefore, the present patient is the only case of disseminated infection caused by N. otitidiscaviarum in a healthy patient without a history of local trauma, to date. Glucocorticoids are well characterized and widely used for immune suppression, however, glucocorticoid use is also one of the risk factors for invasive nocardiosis (1,11). In the present review, corticosteroid administration was considered to be a major contributors to the impaired immunity of the patients (9\/23 cases). Nocardia spp. infection can be observed and confirmed by subculture and positive microscopic detection of a branching gram-positive rod and modified acid-fast stain. It is clinically imperative that the species be identified, as N. farcinica is resistant to third generation cephalosporins and tobramycin, and N. brasiliensis is resistant to minocycline (35). Although there is no uniform standard or recommended application method from the National Committee for Standardization of Clinical Trials, the majority of previous studies have used the diameter of a zone of inhibition to determine antimicrobial susceptibility (36). It has previously been reported that the sensitivity of N. otitidiscaviarum to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics is poor (37), which is consistent with the results of the present case. According to the economic conditions of the patient, minocycline combined with TMP-SMZ was recommended. As with other types of nocardial infections, the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for N. otitidiscaviarum infections remains unknown. Brown-Elliott et al (29) previously reported that relapse was rare in cases treated for 4\u20136 months, although prolonged antibiotic chemotherapy may be required for complete eradication. Furthermore, it has been reported that systemic symptoms disappear after \u22656 weeks, and that immunosuppressed patients should be treated for \u22656 months and patients with central nervous system involvement should sustain treatment for 12 months (9). In nocardiosis cases with CNS involvement, treatment with a combination of antibiotics, such as amikacin and minocycline, is recommended for \u22652 months (13). Although treatment with sulfonamides has been effective in the majority of cases, susceptibility testing for individual patients should guide definitive therapy, particularly for N. otitidiscaviarum infections, which may be resistant to these agents (10,11,19). The present patient received minocycline and TMP-SMZ for 4 months and was considered to be cured. In conclusion, the present study is the first report of disseminated N. otitidiscaviarum infection in an immunocompetent patient without a history of trauma. Clinical and microbiological manifestations of nocardiosis vary for different Nocardia spp.; therefore accurate identification of the species is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment. Susceptibility testing should guide definitive therapy, particularly for N. otitidiscaviarum infections, which may be resistant to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Further experience in the treatment of N. otitidiscaviarum infections is required in order to assess drug susceptibility and clinical outcomes."}]},{"title":"Multiple Brain Abscesses Due to Nocardia otitidiscaviarum: Case Report and Treatment Implications","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Nocardia otitidiscaviarum cause?","id":"28-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"multiple brain abscesses","answer_start":251,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Nocardia infections typically present in immunocompromised hosts.

Nocardia otitidiscaviarum was first isolated from a guinea pig with ear disease in 1924 and has since been known as a rare opportunistic pathogen that causes primary cutaneous, lymphocutaneous, and pulmonary infections in immunocompromised patients as well as immunocompetent patients [11]. There were no published case reports of Nocardia otitidiscaviarum infection in humans until the mid-1960s, and it has been estimated that approximately 3% of Nocardia infections are due to this species. The case in this report describes a rare presentation of multiple brain abscesses formed due to Nocardia otitidiscaviarum infection in an immunocompetent patient. Although several case reports of nocardial brain abscesses in immunocompetent hosts exist in the literature, these cases are due to Nocardia species that are more common such as Nocardia abscessus [5-6], Nocardia farcinica [7-8], and Nocardia asteroides [9-10]. Most of these cases involved a single abscess for which a craniotomy and aspiration were performed before a prolonged course of antibiotics. These immunocompetent patients improved significantly following treatment, with a resolution of neurologic symptoms and no recurrence of the disease. Although a majority of extrapulmonary cases of nocardiosis occur in the CNS [2], there are only three reported cases of Nocardia otitidiscaviarum brain abscesses in immunocompetent hosts [12-14]. These relatively recent cases are outlined in Table \u200bTable1,1, as is the case presented in this report. The cases in the literature involved varying antimicrobial regimens based on sensitivities, as well as varying surgical interventions, with only two cases to date reporting patient survival after prolonged hospital courses. One case involved a patient who died before surgical intervention [14]. Two other older case reports [15-16] also described patients with Nocardia otitidiscaviarum brain abscess who died as well. The primary neurosurgical intervention used in this case and most other cases [12-13], at least initially, was craniotomy with drainage of abscesses. This is standard also for the identification of the causative pathogen [17]. The case described in this report is the first case of Nocardia otitidiscaviarum brain abscess that necessitated hemicraniectomy. Although intrathecal antimicrobial agents have been delivered in other cases of brain abscess [17], this report also describes the first case where this technique was used for Nocardia otitidiscaviarum brain abscess specifically, with eventual resolution of disease. Although the course of intrathecal amikacin presented here was short, it is possible that direct intrathecal delivery of antibiotics expedited the treatment and resolution of intracranial disease. TMP\/SMX: trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole; IV: intravenous; EVD: external ventricular drain As for antimicrobial therapy, each reported case used a variety of broad-spectrum agents prior to obtaining susceptibilities (Table \u200b(Table11). Nocardia otitidiscaviarum is typically susceptible to kanamycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin [11]. It is generally resistant to ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, carbenicillin, and imipenem; it is often resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics [11]. In the case described in this report, the species was susceptible to TMP\/SMX, linezolid, amikacin, tobramycin, and minocycline, with resistance to imipenem, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and clarithromycin. This led to a final regimen of amikacin, TMP\/SMX, and minocycline.  Nocardiosis can be challenging to definitively diagnose, but it should be considered in a differential diagnosis in the setting of multiorgan disease especially involving the lungs and CNS. Broad-spectrum coverage should include an aminoglycoside such as amikacin, as well as TMP\/SMX. Intrathecal amikacin could also be considered, as it was effective in our case as described."}]},{"title":"Disseminated infection with Nocardia otitidiscaviarum in a patient under steroid therapy","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Nocardia otitidiscaviarum?","id":"28-4-1-1","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":1049,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Nocardia otitidiscaviarum cause?","id":"28-4-1-2","answers":[{"text":"pulmonary, primary cutaneous, and lymphocutaneous infections","answer_start":1184,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are N otitidiscaviarum sensitive to?","id":"28-4-1-3","answers":[{"text":"fluoroquinolones and amikacin","answer_start":3038,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are N otitidiscaviarum resistant to?","id":"28-4-1-4","answers":[{"text":"beta\u2010lactams like imipenem, ampicillin, and amoxicillin\u2010clavulanic acid","answer_start":2943,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of N otitidiscaviarum infection in Nepal. Few cases of Nocardia infection of brain, lung, eye, and soft tissue have been reported from Nepal but none of them had performed genetic analysis and identification up to species level. Snijders first isolated N otitidiscaviarum in 1924,7, 8 and Gordon et al first identified its biochemical reactions and distinguished it from other Nocardia species.8 Nomenclature of N caviae was originally proposed, but now the organism is called N otitidiscaviarum.8, 9 A study performed at the National Reference Laboratory in Germany from 1979 to 1991 isolated Nocardia spp. form 131 patients; however, only 8 of them were infected with N otitidiscaviarum.8 N otitidiscaviarum caused much less infections than other Nocardia, which may be due to its lower prevalence in soil and its reduced pathogenicity.8 Despite its low prevalence and pathogenicity, sometimes like our case, it can lead to severe infection.  Nocardia otitidiscaviarum has been described as an opportunistic pathogen in human.10, 11 However, it has been reported in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals causing pulmonary, primary cutaneous, and lymphocutaneous infections.11, 12 Individuals with weak immune system, such as patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, mixed connective tissue disorder, ulcerative colitis, cirrhosis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, malignancies, those receiving long\u2010term corticosteroid therapy, and bone marrow or solid organ transplant, are at higher risk.11, 13   Nocardia infection has nonspecific pathogenic signs or symptoms, and its clinical picture may mimic a variety of other bacterial infections including actinomycosis, tuberculosis, fungal infections, and malignancies.14 A definitive diagnosis can be made by isolation and identification of the organism. For the initial evaluation, Gram stain and modified acid\u2010fast stain must be done.15  Although Nocardia spp. grow on ordinary blood agar, but its growth is slow (ranging from 2 days to weeks). Hence, the plates should be incubated for up to 2 or 3 weeks for slowly growing Nocardia species.4  The drug choice for Nocardia infection is cotrimoxazole, but some of the species are resistance to cotrimoxazole, imipenem, amoxicillin\u2010clavulanic acid, and other antibacterial agents (Table \u200b(Table1)1) 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22; therefore, accurate identification at species level and antimicrobial susceptibility testing must be done.19 N otitidiscaviarum infection requires treatment for long duration, and also, it is suggested that antibiotic therapy should be continued for 6 months in immunocompetent patients and up to a year in immunosuppressed individuals.11  Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns for common Nocardia species14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22  Most N otitidiscaviarum isolates are resistant to beta\u2010lactams like imipenem, ampicillin, and amoxicillin\u2010clavulanic acid but are susceptible to fluoroquinolones and amikacin.5, 11 Meanwhile, some other studies have shown that N otitidiscaviarum complex is sensitive to linezolid in vitro; however, data from in vivo studies are lacking. In addition, 4 weeks of linezolid treatment increases the risk of hematological toxicity, and also, clinical experience with linezolid treatment is limited.11, 20 In our case, we prescribed 3 weeks of linezolid in combination with cotrimoxazole and amikacin as induction therapy followed by maintenance with cotrimoxazole for six months. Minocycline can be used as an alternative agent when sulfa drugs cannot be given. Imipenem and amikacinin higher doses have been used in severe or refractory cases.20 Other alternative antimicrobial agents include amoxicillin\u2010clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, meropenem, linezolid, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and tigecycline can be also used. To minimize the risk of relapse, the treatment is generally prolonged.1  The US National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards has approved broth microdilution as antimicrobial susceptibility testing for both Actinomycetes and Nocardia.11 This may guide the treatment of N otitidiscaviarum, but the optimal treatment protocol of N otitidiscaviarum is still unknown. A combination of sulfonamides and amikacin with carbapenem or third generation cephalosporin had been suggested for severe or disseminated infections.11 Similarly, in this case, the combination therapy (amikacin, meropenem, and cotrimoxazole) was administered empirically and then modified to amikacin, cotrimoxazole, and linezolid after identification of the species.  Nocardia otitidiscaviarum is isolated rarely; however, it can cause localized or disseminated infection, even in an immunocompetent host. The majority of patients responds to cotrimoxazole and aminoglycoside. Identification and drug susceptibility testing for Nocardia species are critical for guiding clinical treatment.8 "}]}]},{"species":"Ralstonia insidiosa","docs":[{"title":"Nosocomial bloodstream infection and the emerging carbapenem-resistant pathogen Ralstonia insidiosa","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can R. insidiosa cause?","id":"29-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"nosocomial bloodstream infection","answer_start":1944,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Ralstonia picketti, Ralstonia mannitolilytica, and Ralstonia insidiosa have recently been regarded as emerging pathogens of infectious diseases, in particular as the pathogens responsible for nosocomial infection in immunocompromised patients.

Ralstonia spp. are emerging as global opportunistic pathogens affecting immunocompromised patients. Even without person-to-person transmission, the prevalence of Ralstonia infection is notably increasing. The bacteria reproduce in wet conditions and can survive in harsh environments (even in weak disinfectants) for long periods. The species exist widely in external aqueous environments including municipal water and medical water purification systems [2, 14]. As the bacteria can pass through 0.2-\u03bcm filters during the sterilization process, medical products may be contaminated during the manufacturing phase [15]. The species can create biofilms on the surfaces of medical supplies and produce toxins. Many infectious cases caused by R. picketti and R. mannitolilytica are due to the use of contaminated solutions, blood products, chlorhexidine, saline solution, and sterile water as well as the colonization of medical devices (tap water and water used for hemodialysis, bronchoscope flushing, and heparin for flushing) [16\u201318]. We described two rare nosocomial cases of bloodstream infections caused by R. insidiosa, although we could not track their source. Both of our patients were at a high risk for infection. One patient had a malignant tumor of the femur and underwent chemotherapy and surgery, while the other patient was bedridden for a long time because of severe multiple fractures and several surgical operations. High risk factors listed in the literature are cancer, blood vessel catheters, chronic renal failure, ischemic heart disease, newborn and other immunocompromised conditions [1]. The common symptom in these two cases was obvious fever, while the common abnormal routine test results were increased neutrophils and aminotransferase. Based on our results, we recommend MALDI-TOF MS for rapid identification of R. insidiosa. Due to the inaccurate biochemical reactions, both of our R. insidiosa isolates were misidentified as R. mannitolilytica by the VITEK 2 Compact system, a widely accepted commercial automated biochemical identification instrument. The manual identification keys are that R. insidiosa metabolizes nitrate but not mannitol or arabinose, R. picketti metabolizes nitrate and arabinose but not mannitol, and R. mannitolilytica metabolizes only mannitol but not nitrate or arabinose [3]. Ralstonia spp. are very close to the Burkholderia cepacia complex and Pseudomonas fluorescens; the previous name of R. picketti was Burkholderia pickettii. Previously, we reported that the VITEK 2 system misidentified Burkholderia pseudomallei as Burkholderia cepacia [19]. This reminds us that clinicians should be cautious with automated identification of non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, especially Burkholderia reported by the VITEK 2 system. For species identification, our study showed that using either the universal primers 27F\/1492R or the species-specific primers Rp-F1\/R38R1, 16S rRNA gene sequencing were practical. Additionally, species-specific primers Rp-F1\/R38R1 were much more rapid for identifying R. insidiosa from R. picketti and R. mannitolilytica, because no amplicon band of R. picketti or R. mannitolilytica could be observed on the electrophoresis gel. However, considering turnaround time and PCR identification cost, MALDI-TOF MS would be a better choice. Our results supported the general consensus that MALDI-TOF MS could provide rapid and accurate results [20]. Both of our R. insidiosa isolates were multi-drug resistant, even the strain that was carbapenems-resistant. The antibiotic susceptibility data for R. insidiosa are very limited, not to mention that of clinical isolates. A study reporting antibiotic susceptibility profiles of 15 environmental R. insidiosa isolates showed that quinolones and the folate pathway inhibitors (sulfamethoxazole\/trimethoprim) were most effective [21]. MICs results of our clinical isolates were consistent with those results and revealed that piperacillin\/tazobactam and tigecycline were also susceptible alternatives. Considering accessibility, cost and side effects, quinolones may be a good choice for initial empirical therapy. However, since antimicrobial susceptibility (i.e., carbapenem susceptibility) discriminated between isolates, we still recommend that clinicians select antibiotics according to their MICs results. Genome sequencing of our R. insidiosa WCHRI065162 and WCHRI065437 has improved current understanding of the antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity of this species. Due to a wide range of SNPs, our isolates were not the same clone, and neither of our isolates was close to those two fully assembled genomes of R. insidiosa in the NCBI database. Bacterial secretion systems present on the cell membranes are the cellular components used by pathogenic bacteria to secrete their virulence factors in order to invade the host cells. Although the classification is not very clear or complete, pathogenic gram-negative bacteria possess at least six secretory systems related to virulence factors [22]. The T2SS (Type II secretion system) contains a pseudopilus and secretes toxins and hydrolyzing enzymes. A main role of T4SS (type IV secretion system) is to facilitate the spread of drug-resistant genes located on plasmids through conjunction. T5SS (type V secretion system) is mainly involved in virulence factor secretion, intercellular adhesion and biofilm formation. The T3SS (type III secretion system), especially type IV pilus (T4P) biogenesis system, and T6SS (type VI secretion system) are now recognized as pathogenicity hallmarks in many gram-negative bacteria [23, 24]. These systems deliver bacterial proteins called effectors into neighboring bacteria or host cells, leading to cytotoxicity and cell death of targets. Both R. insidiosa ATCC 49129 and R. insidiosa FC1138 have T3SS and T6SS gene clusters, but our two isolates carried only T6SS gene clusters, implying that T6SS may be more crucial for the virulence of R. insidiosa. T7SS (type VII secretion system), rarely found in gram-negative bacteria, is a specialized secretion apparatus required for the virulence of mycobacteria [22]. However, all of R. insidiosa ATCC 49129, FC1138 and our isolates have T7SS. Further fundamental research is needed to reveal the role of T7SS in the virulence of R. insidiosa. Quorum sensing, an efficient bacterial cell-to-cell communication process for population growth, involves bioluminescence, secretion of virulence factors, production of public products, and biofilm formation [25]. Both of our isolates contained biofilm formation genes (Pel) related to the generation of glucose-rich extracellular polysaccharide (PEL) and the construction of biofilm matrix. To some extent, these genes may be responsible for pathogenicity and multi-drug resistance phenotypes of R. insidiosa. Bacteriocin, one family of microbial defense systems, is now considered to be the most diverse and naturally abundant antimicrobial molecule [26]. Colicin V and bacteriocin production cluster subsystems were found in both of our isolates. Both of our isolates were resistant to the \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, polymyxin B, and aminoglycosides. It is known that two chromosomally encoded class D \u03b2-lactamases, OXA-22 and OXA-60, are related to multidrug-resistance of Ralstonia spp. [27, 28]. OXA-22 is active against benzylpenicillin, cloxacillin and some cephalosporins, while OXA-60 is active against imipenem. Also, blaOXA-569, blaOXA-570, blaXA-573 and blaOXA-574 are very similar to blaOXA-22 and blaOXA-60. Although both our strains harbored a blaOXA-60 variant (blaOXA-570 and blaOXA-573), only isolate WCHRI065162 carrying blaOXA-570 was resistant to carbapenems. The cloning experiment showed that variant OXA-573 revealed in this study had no carbapenem hydrolase activity. Polymyxin, a cationic polypeptide interacting with the negatively charged phosphate groups in the lipopolysaccharide of the bacterial outer membrane, is the last resort antibiotic against extensively drug-resistant gram-negative bacillus infection. Many pathogens, including Burkholderia spp., are inherently resistant to antimicrobial peptides [29]. Members of the R. pickettii lineage, including R. insidiosa, are intrinsically resistant to colistin [30], which clinicians should be aware of prior to issuing antibiotic prescriptions. The main limitation of this study is that the source of bloodstream infection in our patients was unknown. Since Ralstonia exists widely in the external aqueous environment, a contaminated water supply or parenteral fluid could be the primary source of infection. However, no contamination in our hospital water supply was found during follow up surveillance. Due to our previous limited understanding of Ralstonia, no sample from environment at that time was reserved for further investigation. This report serves as an alert for medical workers and researchers to pay more attention to infection caused by R. insidiosa. In conclusion, we described two cases of nosocomial bloodstream infection and the microbiological profile of their causable R. insidiosa strains. MALDI-TOF MS was cost-effective for rapid species identification. Clinicians should be aware that species R. insidiosa is capable of being resistant to many routinely used antibiotics, even carbapenems."}]}]},{"species":"Ralstonia pickettii","docs":[{"title":"Native Valve Endocarditis due to Ralstonia pickettii: A Case Report and Literature Review","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can R. pickettii cause?","id":"30-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia leading to aortic valve abscess","answer_start":121,"id":1},{"text":"infective endocarditis with perivalvular abscess","answer_start":266,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Ralstonia pickettii is a rare pathogen and even more rare in healthy individuals.

Several weeks prior to presentation patient had a central venous catheter placed for intravenous iron infusions to treat refractory iron-deficiency anemia. Three weeks prior to presentation, the patient had left tarsal tunnel release with no postoperative complications. Upon presentation, to the hospital for evaluation she was bradycardic with a pulse of 48 beats per minute, hypotensive with a blood pressure of 106\/54 mmHg (as compared to her baseline hypertension), and febrile to 101.3\u00b0C. Given her history of DVT, a computed tomography (CT) angiogram was ordered that revealed no new pulmonary emboli but showed cavitary lung lesions suggestive of septic emboli. An electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated accelerated junctional escape rhythm with complete atrioventricular block (Figure 1). Blood and urine cultures were obtained, and patient was initiated on empiric coverage for endocarditis with vancomycin, gentamicin, and micafungin. ECG demonstrating complete atrioventricular block with accelerated junctional escape. Given CT evidence of septic emboli, fevers, and ECG findings of complete AV block, an initial transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed on day two of admission, followed by a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) on day three of admission. TEE confirmed initial TTE findings of aortic valve thickening on the left coronary cusp highly suggestive of vegetation (Figure 2) and associated severe aortic regurgitation. Furthermore, an echo density was noted at the aortic root with color flow transmission highly suggestive of an aortic root abscess with fistula (Figure 3). There was moderate mitral valve regurgitation with normal left ventricular systolic function. A bicuspid aortic valve was also noted on the TEE. Gram-positive cocci were seen on Gram stain from blood cultures drawn on admission; therefore she was continued on vancomycin and gentamicin. The patient was referred for emergent cardiothoracic surgery with replacement of the aortic valve with a 19 mm freestyle tissue valve, incision and drainage and debridement of the subannular abscess, and reconstruction of the proximal anterior leaflet of the mitral valve and aortic annulus with pericardial patch placement which was performed at an outside hospital on day six of hospitalization. No pacemaker was placed at this time of surgery as the cardiothoracic surgeons felt that it would best be placed once her blood cultures were sterile. At the time of valve replacement a transfemoral pacer was placed. Transesophageal echocardiogram at midesophageal inflow\/outflow tract revealing subannular abscess, in diastole. Transesophageal echocardiogram at midesophageal long-axis view with Doppler revealing regurgitation into abscess surrounding the aortic valve suggestive of aortic fistula. Within 24 hours of hospitalization, blood cultures drawn on admission began growing what was initially identified as Gram-positive cocci. However, on day three of admission the Gram stain was reassessed and changed to Gram-negative rods identified as Ralstonia species. Repeat blood cultures on consecutive days up until the day of surgery grew persistent Ralstonia species, which was ultimately identified as Ralstonia pickettii. Surgical specimens from the aortic valve and annular abscess all had heavy growth of R. pickettii (surgical intervention on day 6). All postsurgical blood cultures remained negative (Table 1). She was initially on aggressive Gram-positive coverage initially with vancomycin and gentamicin; however this was quickly changed to levofloxacin once sensitivities returned. The Ralstonia species, later identified as pickettii, was sensitive to quinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole only with intermediate sensitivity to piperacillin\/tazobactam, imipenem, and cefepime and complete resistance to tobramycin amikacin and gentamycin. Her postoperative course was uneventful except for dental extractions done for extensive necrosis and caries. She was initiated on levofloxacin on day four of admission and completed a total of eight weeks of therapy postoperatively. Upon sterilization of blood cultures approximately one week after surgery, a dual-chamber pacemaker was implanted. Blood culture results as referenced by days after hospital admission with day 1 being the day of admission. Surgical intervention with aortic valve replacement occurred on day 6 of hospitalization. Organism identified in all cultures was Ralstonia pickettii. DPA: days postadmission; TTP: time to positivity in hours. Unfortunately, shortly after completion of the initial eight weeks of antibiotic therapy, the patient developed recurrent bacteremia with Ralstonia pickettii complicated by a periannular abscess around the new aortic valve prosthesis and a pseudoaneurysm of the ascending aorta. She was again emergently taken for repeat aortic root replacement with a 24 mm homograft and treated with aggressive antibiotic therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and levofloxacin (after repeat sensitivity testing). Unfortunately the patient rapidly succumbed to infection and died due to complications of persistent bacteremia.  Ralstonia species are aerobic Gram-negative, oxidase-positive, nonfermenting bacilli that have in recent years been identified as emerging opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised hosts. Both environmental and hospital sources have been identified in human infection. Of the Ralstonia genus, Ralstonia pickettii formerly known as Burkholderia pickettii is regarded as the one with clinical importance [1]. It was first identified as Pseudomonas pickettii in 1973 [2] and then reclassified in 1992 to the Burkholderia [3] genus and finally in 1995 to a new genus Ralstonia [4\u20136], based upon cellular lipid and fatty acid composition, phenotypic analysis, and both DNA and 16s rRNA sequencing and hybridization.

At that time, the pathogen was reported as an unclassified, Gram-negative bacterium (Group IV d) which was only later identified as Ralstonia pickettii [8]. The case was a 33-year-old African American male who had persistent positive blood cultures with a Group IV d Gram-negative bacillus resistant to all attempted antibiotics (ampicillin, penicillin G, and chloramphenicol). Autopsy was refused; however the patient was noted to have persistent positive blood cultures, a IV\/VI harsh systolic murmur at the apex transmitting to the axilla, and fevers, suggesting endocarditis due to persistent bacteremia as cause of death [7]. More recent outbreaks of Ralstonia pickettii infections are documented as nosocomial outbreaks related to the use of contaminated medical solutions (saline, sterile water, disinfectants, intravenous ranitidine, and narcotics) used in patient care [9\u201317]. In Table 2 we provide a comprehensive review of literature to date from 2005 onward that reflects possible contamination sources as well as outcomes. Prior to 2006 Ryan et al. provide an excellent comprehensive review [1]. The presumptive ability of Ralstonia to persist in these sterile solutions is thought to be associated with its ability to survive within a wide range of temperatures (15\u00b0C\u201342\u00b0C) and pass through both 0.2 and 0.45 \u03bcm filters, which are used to filter-sterilize medical solutions [18]. In a review of the literature there have been 55 cases of Ralstonia species infections, ranging from bacteremia to meningitis. The majority of infections reported have been treated with piperacillin, imipenem plus amikacin, and a combination of unnamed cephalosporins and aminoglycoside, as well as meropenem. There is no standardized recommendation for the treatment of Ralstonia infection because of the differences in sensitivities in particular to the carbapenems and aminoglycosides as well as the range of disease which includes asymptomatic to frank sepsis as in our patient. Only eight documented cases have resulted in death. The first case was the index case in 1968 as described above [7]. Two cases were elderly diabetic patients who died from complications of R. pickettii septicemia as a result of contaminated ion-exchange resins used to purify water for hospital use [19]. The ion-exchange resins used for deionization of city water allowed the survival of bacteria normally found in the city water supply while the bacteriological filters downstream only lowered the contamination level. Four premature infants have died from complications of R. pickettii-related infections. Of the four cases, one was pneumonia [20] and the other three were associated with bacteremia and sepsis [21, 22]. Finally, the eighth documented case resulting in death is our 51-year-old female who developed endocarditis due to complications of Ralstonia pickettii bacteremia with perivalvular abscess. Comprehensive review of the literature from 2005 of cases of Ralstonia pickettii infection, traced source(s), and treatments where available.  ECMO: extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; IV: intravenous; AVR: aortic valve replacement; TMP-SMX: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.  Presumed to have endocarditis but could not confirm diagnosis. Immunocompromised patients seem to be at the highest risk of infection with pulmonary and blood stream infections being the primary routes [23]. Patients with acquired (i.e., HIV) or pharmaceutical (i.e., steroids, TNF blockers) induced immunosuppression are the most likely to succumb to infection with Ralstonia species. The single most important risk factor for acquiring infection with R. pickettii is cystic fibrosis. Furthermore, while respiratory tract and other nonsystemic infections responded well to parenteral antibiotic therapy, it seems to have little success in cases of R. pickettii bacteremia and sepsis, in particular, if a contaminated central venous line is involved. Removal of any indwelling device such as a central venous catheter is mandatory and critical in source control. Interestingly, our patient had several predisposing risk factors that placed her at risk for both R. pickettii infection and complications. Approximately two months prior to presentation, our patient had a central venous catheter placed for intravenous iron transfusions. She also underwent tarsal tunnel release three weeks prior to presentation. In each of these settings she was exposed to not only potentially contaminated infusions but also hospital related procedures that may have resulted in infectious complications. Previous outbreaks have implicated hospital water, distilled water, saline, ion exchange resins, IV ranitidine, hemodialysis machines, and intravenous drug use [1]. Fortunately, our patient was an isolated case with no other cases suggesting that this was not a hospital associated outbreak. Finally, she was found to have a bicuspid aortic valve, which, in bacteremia, has been associated with increased incidence of infective endocarditis (IE) when compared to those without bicuspid aortic valves. Cases of IE occurring in patients with bicuspid aortic valves as compared to native valves have increased incidence of complications such as valve perforation, valve destruction, heart failure, and valvular, perivalvular, and\/or myocardial abscess [24, 25]. Patients with health care-associated infections or who have had recent hospitalization or medical intervention (as in our case) are a new risk group that requires careful diagnostic attention in the presence of fever and bacteremia to evaluate infective endocarditis. Ralstonia pickettii should be considered an important potential etiology of nosocomial infections among patients who are immunocompromised, have cystic fibrosis, have central venous catheters, or have had recent surgical or medical hospitalizations. It is important to quickly recognize and treat R. pickettii as it has been identified as causing many potentially harmful infections resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Ralstonia species are thought to be a rare infectious organism; however, our review of the literature suggests that the organism may be a more widespread and invasive pathogen than previously thought."}]},{"title":"Sonication contribution to identifying prosthetic joint infection with Ralstonia pickettii: a case report and review of the literature","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Ralstonia pickettii is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"30-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":284,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can R. pickettii cause?","id":"30-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"Prosthetic joint infection","answer_start":2237,"id":1},{"text":"PJI","answer_start":390,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"In the context of an increase number of primary and revision total hip and total knee arthroplasty performed yearly, an increased risk of complication is expected.

It is an aerobic non-fermenting bacillus, which is found in soil and water. Ralstonia pickettii has been rarely known to cause severe invasive infections, including pneumonia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, and septic arthritis [1-3]. It is a waterborne organism of low virulence, with a propensity to cause severe infections in the immunocompromised, resulting in significant mortality and morbidity [1]. Among our cases, two of the patients had chronic debilitating illnesses, which could have weakened their immune systems, predisposing them to infection with this organism. A number of cases have been attributed to contaminated solutions, e.g., saline solutions given as an intravenous infusion or utilized in wound cleaning or for endotracheal suctioning and reported from the contamination of dialysis water and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy [4-7]. These have resulted in bloodstream, as well as respiratory, infections. However, in all of our cases, we could not identify any potential source of contamination. The underlying conditions reported to have been associated include alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and intravenous drug abuse [1,8]. Two of our cases had hypertension, one had diabetes and end-stage renal disease while one patient had a prolonged ICU stay, which likely led to a nosocomial acquisition of organism. There have been reports of central line-associated infections with this pathogen and CLABSI was the identified source of infection in two of our cases also [9]. There have been several instances of outbreaks and because of the ubiquitous nature of the organism, differentiating between bacteremia and pseudo-bacteremia is important to avoid unnecessary treatment [4,10-11]. In vitro data suggest susceptibility to ceftriaxone but clinical failure has been reported and has been attributed to a lack of understanding of resistance mechanisms [12]. Other studies have shown in vitro susceptibility to quinolones, trimethoprim, and sulphamethoxazole [13]. Patients usually respond to intravenous third and fourth generation cephalosporins, which have been used as either monotherapy or in combination with amikacin or carbapenems [10]. We had used meropenem based on the susceptibility of our isolates. Colistin was used as part of the regimen in one of our cases because of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter pneumonia. One out of the three cases developed clinical failure with meropenem monotherapy, leading to the addition of levofloxacin based on culture and susceptibility, which resulted in improvement, as well as microbiological eradication evidenced by the clearance of blood culture. There have been reports of failure with meropenem where improvement was achieved with quinolones [14]. Treatment outcomes vary depending on the source of infection. Mortality in one of the series was reported to be around 7% [1]. Two out of three of our cases died, showing a poor outcome with infections caused by this organism. Our cases are the first to be reported from this region and highlight the importance of suspecting these infections in patients with healthcare-associated infections or who have had recent hospitalization or prolonged hospital stay requiring multiple interventions and invasive catheters.

In 2011, R. mannitolilytica was first isolated in China from a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [8]. R. mannitolilytica infects humans mainly through water sources and affects mainly immunocompromised groups [3\u20138]. The common sources of contamination in hospitals are water used during dialysis, sterile water for injection, and oxygen delivery systems [3, 5, 7]. However, in most cases, the source is unknown. In our case, pregnancy was associated with a transient immunocompromised state, which put her at higher risk for R. mannitolilytica infection. However, the source of the infection is still unknown. She had rapid progression to critical septic shock, and there were no subsequent cases in our hospital. Obstetric sepsis is among the top 3 leading causes of maternal death worldwide, and can lead to multiple organ or system dysfunction and even failure [9]. In most reported cases, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus and Staphylococci are the causal bacteria of severe obstetrical infectious events [10]. This is the first report of maternal infection caused by R. mannitolilytica, and this case confirms the notion that this opportunistic pathogen causes maternal infections. Due to the diversity of infected tissues and organs, the main clinical manifestations of R. mannitolilytica infection are pneumonia, bacteremia, and meningitis, and a few cases develop septic shock. The main symptoms of the current case were fever and hypotension, which progressed to septic shock a short time after the operation. These symptoms were basically consistent with descriptions in the literature [4, 11, 12]. When the pathogen was not clear, initial treatment with supportive therapy and an empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic strategy could be selected according to the American Critical Medical Association\u2019s 2016 International guidelines for Treatment of Sepsis and Septic Shock [13]. Concurrently, pathogen culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were carried out. R. mannitolilytica can produce various enzymes that can hydrolyze antibiotics. These compounds can confer resistance to a broad range of antibiotics, including benzylpenicillin, narrow-spectrum cephalosporins, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and carbapenems [14]. Additionally, different strains show different drug resistance [2]. Daxboeck et al. reported that among the 30 strains isolated, 12 strains developed resistance to carbapenem antibiotics [12]. In Said\u2019s studies, all strains were resistant to meropenem but sensitive to imipenem [6]. Due to technical restrictions and equipment constraints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing was not carried out. Imipenem cilastatin sodium was used in our patient according to reported experience and clinical practice. After treatment with antibiotics, most patients, though not those with cystic fibrosis, who are infected with R. mannitolilytica infection have a good prognosis [15]. However, there is no unified standard for the treatment time. Procalcitonin kinetics have been proven to have prognostic value correlating with disease severity and resolution of illness. For more severe infections (such as sepsis), determining antibiotic treatment by monitoring procalcitonin kinetics resulted in a shorter antibiotic treatment duration with early cessation of therapy. These strategies appear to be safe without increasing the risk of mortality, recurrent infections or treatment failure [16]. According to the experience of this case, when the clinical manifestations and procalcitonin level were significantly abnormal, antibiotics were used. Once procalcitonin dropped to levels < 0.5 ng\/ml in combination with clinical improvement, the treatment was stopped, and this resulted not only in satisfactory results but also in no related complications. In summary, R. mannitolilytica, a new opportunistic pathogen, can contribute to critical infectious events. As a special patient group, pregnant and postpartum women should be assessed for the possibility of infection with this pathogen if rapid sepsis and septic shock occur. Early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotics can decrease complications."}]},{"title":"Ralstonia mannitolilytica sepsis: a case report","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Ralstonia mannitolilytica cause?","id":"31-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"septic shock, meningitis, and renal transplant infections","answer_start":114,"id":1},{"text":"sepsis","answer_start":680,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Ralstonia mannitolilytica?","id":"31-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"emerging opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":32,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Ralstonia mannitolilytica is an emerging opportunistic pathogen that is associated with severe disease, including septic shock, meningitis, and renal transplant infections.

Ralstonia mannitolilytica (R. mannitolilytica) is another emerging opportunistic pathogen within the nonfermenting gram-negative bacillus group that is present in both hospital and environmental settings [1]. R. mannitolilytica had previously been referred to as \u201cPseudomonas thomasii\u201d and R. pickettii biovar 3\/\u201cthomasii\u201d [2].

Although less frequent, the few documented cases are severe, with reported incidences in hospital outbreaks, bacteremia and bacteriuria, meningitis, renal transplant infection, and hemoperitoneum infection [4, 5, 7]. In rare cases, R. mannitolilytica has been isolated from contaminated oxygen delivery devices [1]. Our patient was a 2-year-old child residing in a rural part of Ghana. She had no known history of any underlying chronic disease or immunological suppression apart from her presentation of fever and chills. The presence of this bacterium in the blood is of importance, being the first such report from West Africa. Although it might be difficult to determine the extent of disease severity on account of malaria or sepsis, the isolation of a pure strain of the bacterium in blood suggests a pathogenic association with sepsis. Our report is not different from a recent review of three infants from China who similarly presented with chills and fever [4]. Their cases progressed to septic shock, however, with symptoms including increased heart rate and decreased urine output. We also observed reduced sensitivity in the accuracy of speciation by the API. Although the API identified this bacterium as R. pickettii, the 16S rDNA technique revealed this as R. mannitolilytica. Other authors have similarly reported variations and inconsistencies in the use of standard biochemistry-based techniques for identification of Ralstonia because these techniques share similar biochemical patterns [8]. This emphasizes the importance of using molecular techniques as a supporting diagnostic confirmation, especially for nonfermenting bacteria. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing also showed susceptibility to antibiotics, including gentamicin, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and cotrimoxazole. Treatment and management of Ralstonia spp. has been reported as challenging because of their intrinsic resistance to inducible \u03b2-lactamases [9]. The isolated bacterium did not exhibit this form of resistance. A more structured epidemiological study would be helpful to further evaluate this occurrence.

They could be an aetiological agent in common source nosocomial outbreaks due to contamination of parenteral fluid and medical equipment that is considered to be sterile [2].   R. mannitolilytica   are known to cause sepsis, meningitis and central venous catheter-associated bacteraemia [3]. Of late several case reports of infections by   R. mannitolilytica   have been seen from India and worldwide [4\u201312]. Many case reports have highlighted   R. mannitolilytica   as causing bacteraemia and sepsis [4\u201311]. Lampropoulos et al. (2021) and Rajendran et al. (2022) highlighted the organism as an emerging opportunistic pathogen causing sepsis in neonatal intensive care units [9, 10] . Carreira et al. (2020) emphasized the role of   R. mannitolilytica   in endocarditis [12]. The tendency of R.mannitolilytica to form biofilm enhances the organism\u2019s survival in the environment (including the hospital environment), and plays a role in frequent antibiotic resistance [13]. There are currently no clear treatment guidelines or Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints for   R. mannitolilytica  . Treatment is challenging, as this species is frequently resistant to many antibiotics [1]. Resistance to many of the \u03b2-lactam class of antibiotics, including the carbapenems, is generally observed in   R. mannitolilytica  . blaOXA-22 and blaOXA-60 are class D carabapenmase genes that are commonly associated with   Ralstonia   species [14]. Treatment is based on the antibiotic susceptibility profile of the isolate [1]. There are very few case reports on this rare opportunistic pathogen in bloodstream infections from India. In this case series, we summarize the clinical characteristics of 14 patients with nosocomial bloodstream infections caused by R.mannitolilytica in the last 2 years, and analyse their risk factors, management and outcomes. We have also reported drug susceptibility patterns, which may help in the management of patients infected with this bacterium."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of drugs are R. mannitolilytica resistant to?","id":"31-3-3-1","answers":[{"text":"many routinely used antibiotics, including carbapenems","answer_start":6790,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Few cases of infections caused by R.mannitolilytica have been reported due to limited awareness of the pathogen. The development of modern medical care, inappropriate and unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the extensive use of various immunosuppressants have caused increased rates of opportunistic infections from organisms such as R.mannitolilytica. The prevalence of   Ralstonia   infection is increasing notably, even without person-to-person transmission [1].   Ralstonia   exist widely in external aqueous environments, including municipal water and medical water purification systems [20, 21]. As the bacteria can pass through 0.2 \u00b5m filters during the sterilization process, medical products may be contaminated during the manufacturing phase [22].   Ralstonia   can create biofilms on the surfaces of medical supplies and produce toxins [13]. Most infectious cases caused by   Ralstonia   species are due to the use of contaminated solutions, chlorhexidine, saline solution, blood products and sterile water as well as the colonization of medical devices (tap water and water used for haemodialysis, bronchoscope flushing and heparin for flushing) [3, 23, 24]. In this case series we have described 14 nosocomial cases of bloodstream infections caused by   R. mannitolilytica  , although we could not track their source. All of our patients were at high risk of infection. The high-risk factors listed in the literature are cancer, blood vessel catheters, mechanical ventilation and other immunocompromised conditions [1, 25] that were also found in our study. The most frequent risk factor in the study population was the use of chemotherapy and steroids, which could be why most of the patients in the study had malignancy, which itself is an immunocompromised state [3]. Further, these patients received chemotherapy as well as immunosuppressant drugs [3]. Hence, such patients are vulnerable to opportunistic infections such as   Ralstonia  , which is non-harmful to healthy persons [1]. Long-term use of steroids also causes an increase in the rate of infections due to deranged cellular immunity. Central lines are essential in malignancy patients for long-term chemotherapy infusions, and infection of central lines might happen during the insertion procedure as well as during the maintenance period. Biofilm formation in the central lines might cause bacteria to harbour and cause central line-associated bloodstream infections [4]. Blood products through central lines might help in the formation of biofilms that might cause central line infections in these cases. It is well accepted that, over time, the presence of endotracheal tubes for mechanical ventilation increases the risk of bacterial colonization and the development of infection. Similarly, it is conceivable that   Ralstonia  , a water-borne bacterium cultured from respiratory devices, may have the capacity to colonize the airways; its capacity to generate biofilms, like   Pseudomonas   species, enables it to cause infection in patients who are mechanically ventilated for longer periods [21]. Diabetes itself causes increased infections due to unbalanced blood sugar levels in patients. All of these patients had prolonged hospital stays, which might have led to acquisition of this bacterium. Boattini et al. (2018) reported that this pathogen is an important cause of nosocomial bacteraemia in diabetics, preterm infants, solid organ and haematological malignancy patients, and patients with end-stage renal disease [4]. Thomas et al. (2021) reported it to cause bacteraemia and gastroenteritis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis. Diagnosis and management of   Ralstonia   spp. infections is challenging. First, there is the difficulty of correctly identifying and differentiating between   Ralstonia   spp. members using routine laboratory analyses, because they have very similar biochemical patterns to each other and to other bacterial genera, such as the   Burkholderia cepacia   complex [1]. MALDI-TOF showed good performance regarding the identification of   R. mannitolilytica   in a previous study using isolates from patients with cystic fibrosis [26]. Although 16S rDNA is the reference method for identifying micro-organisms, it is costly and cumbersome. In the present study, MALDI-TOF correctly identified all of the isolates rapidly. Therefore, in comparison to the turnaround time and PCR identification cost of the 16S sequencing method, MALDI-TOF MS would be a better choice for identification of   R. mannitolilytica   . Our results support the general consensus that MALDI-TOF MS can provide rapid and accurate results [27]. Second,   R. mannitolilytica   are frequently resistant to numerous different types of antibiotics, including several beta-lactams and most of the aminoglycosides [1]. The organism may produce various enzymes that can hydrolyze antibiotics. These can confer resistance to a broad range of antibiotics, including benzylpenicillin, narrow-spectrum cephalosporins, ceftazidime, aztreonam and the carbapenems [26]. As currently there are no clear treatment guidelines for   R. mannitolilytica   and the data from various case reports reveal a notable heterogeneity in the percentage of antibiotic resistance amongst   R. mannitolilytica   isolates, in the course of treatment we advocate using antibiotic susceptibility testing to adjust the use of antimicrobial agents. Our antibiotic susceptibility pattern showed maximum resistance to aminoglycosides and no resistance to cefoperazone\/sulbactum. Hence most of our patients were treated with cefoperazone\/sulbactum or a with some other third-generation cephalosporins. Daxboeck et al. reported carbapenem resistance in 12 out of their 30 strains [28], which is consistent with our study, where we found carbapenem resistance in 6 out of 14 isolates. Thus meropenem was only used for seriously ill patients whose antibiograms showed sensitivity to meropenem. A 93 % (13\/14) recovery rate in the study patients supports the view that early diagnosis and early initiation of appropriate antibiotics are required for good outcomes in these patients. Even though   R. mannitolilytica   is not recognized as a major pathogen, clinicians and microbiologists should pay attention to the potential of this opportunistic bacterium, which is able to cause bloodstream infections, as it has certain notable characteristics, such as multidrug resistance, the ability to survive in water supplies and resistance to disinfection practices. Prompt diagnosis and subsequent administration of antibiotics in line with antimicrobial susceptibility testing results are needed to clear infections. MALDI-TOF MS is helpful for rapid identification and   R. mannitolilytica   is capable of being resistant to many routinely used antibiotics, including carbapenems."}]},{"title":"Ralstonia mannitolilytica bacteraemia: a case report and literature review","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Ralstonia mannitolilytica is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"31-4-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":64,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can R. mannitolilytica cause?","id":"31-4-1-2","answers":[{"text":"bacteraemia","answer_start":200,"id":1},{"text":"bacteraemia","answer_start":366,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Ralstonia mannitolilytica's requirement for oxygen?","id":"31-4-1-3","answers":[{"text":"aerobic","answer_start":55,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Ralstonia mannitolilytica?","id":"31-4-1-4","answers":[{"text":"bacillus","answer_start":78,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Ralstonia mannitolilytica is a difficult-to-diagnose, aerobic, Gram-negative bacillus, mainly causing healthcare infections in immunocompromised hosts.

Her medical history did not reveal any specific illness, including acquired immune deficiency syndrome. She did not smoke or consume alcohol. During her 3-day stay, she visited the beach in California. On her way to the beach, she encountered a dust storm and inhaled a large amount of dust. Seven days after she returned to Japan (9 days after encountering the dust storm), she was admitted to a local hospital in Nagasaki owing to a progressive dry cough (clinical day 8). On admission, the vital signs of the patient were as follows: body temperature, 37.5\u00b0C; blood pressure, 99\/64 mm Hg; pulse, 72 beats\/min with a regular rhythm; SpO2, 96% in a room air condition; and respiratory rate, 16 breaths\/min. Cyanosis, cardiac murmur, and breath sounds were absent. Moreover, her liver, spleen and lymph nodes were not palpable. Her white blood cell count was 7.3 \u00d7 10\/ml, with a shift to the left (71% neutrophils), and her C-reactive protein value was 5 mg\/dl (normal range, 0 to 0.3 mg\/dl). The chest computed tomography (CT) images revealed multiple round lesions located on both lobes, with diameters of 0.5 to 1 cm (Fig. 1 and \u200band2).2). The radiological findings strongly suggested metastatic tumors; hence, digestive tract endoscopy and positron emission tomography (PET) of the entire body were performed. No other lesions, except the lesions in the lungs, were found to contribute to the findings. Two weeks later (clinical day 21), the multiple pulmonary lesions had grown in size by 3-fold, with partial cavity formation (Fig. 1 and \u200band2).2). Owing to the extreme rapid progression of the lesions, the patient was transferred to our hospital for further examination and treatment. An oral antibiotic, faropenem (FRPM), at 600 mg\/day was given from clinical days 21 to 24. On admission (clinical day 25), we suspected acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis because of her travel history to the U.S. West Coast and the similarities of her CT images with those of typical pulmonary Coccidioides infection (3), and we administered liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) at 150 mg\/day intravenously on clinical day 26. We also initiated tazobactam-piperacillin (TAZ-PIPC) therapy at 18 g\/day concurrently, because the presence of other bacterial infections was not completely excluded. Before the initiation of antibiotic therapy, a transbronchial biopsy (TBB) using endobronchial ultrasonography with a guide sheath was performed 48 h after the cessation of FRPM treatment. The presence of antibodies against Coccidioides was also examined before the initiation of antifungal treatment (clinical day 26). After 9 days of treatment (clinical day 35), her fever subsided, but the pulmonary lesions that were observed on radiological examination had not improved. Chest radiography film images 2 weeks before admission (clinical day 8), showing several nodules in the bilateral lower lung field (A), and on admission (clinical day 25), showing enlargement of the lung nodules, as the bilateral lower lung field is almost entirely covered by the lesions (B). Chest CT image of the thorax 2 weeks before admission (clinical day 8), showing multiple round lesions located in both lobes with diameters of 1 to 2 cm (A), and on admission (clinical day 25), showing increases in the number and size (diameters of 2 to 4 cm) of the lung nodules (B). Primary culturing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was performed with blood and chocolate agar plates. BALF (inoculum volume, 5 \u03bcl) was streaked onto the plate quantitatively and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Only molar-tooth-like colonies were observed in 3 days. Hemolysis around the colonies was not observed, and the quantitative culture yielded 1 \u00d7 10 CFU\/ml. The organism was a coryneform Gram-positive rod that did not produce catalase. On commercial biochemical testing (ID panel, Phoenix Automated Microbiology System; Becton, Dickinson Co., Ltd., Japan), the organism was initially identified as Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, contrary to its colony characteristics. Upon repeated biochemical testing, the isolate was reidentified as Arcanobacterium haemolyticum. The microphotographs and colony characteristics of the organism isolated from the BALF are shown in Fig. 3. The MIC values of the tested antibiotics, including penicillin G, ampicillin, piperacillin, cefotiam, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, erythromycin, and clarithromycin, were found to be less than 0.05 \u03bcg\/ml. Only minocycline had an MIC value of 4 \u03bcg\/ml. Results of the acid-fast staining and PCR testing of the patient's BALF for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium, and Mycobacterium intracellulare were negative. Microphotographs and colony morphological features of the organism isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage. Panel A shows numerous coryneform Gram-positive rods (Gram stain). Panel B shows the molar-tooth-like appearance of the colonies on blood agar (72 h after incubation). Although a Gram-positive rod bacterium was isolated from the BALF cultures, the histological findings of the TBB specimen could reveal only nonspecific inflammation. Thus, there was a possibility of coinfection with other etiologic pathogens. The Coccidioides antibody was not detected on clinical day 32. However, owing to her unique travel history and radiological findings, we could not completely exclude the possibility of acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. Therefore, we performed an additional histological assessment and repetitive examinations for detection of Coccidioides antibody to confirm the diagnosis. On clinical day 36, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was performed to acquire lung tissue. During VATS, the nodule (30 mm) in the right lower lobe was resected and examined. On histological examination, lymphocyte infiltration, fibrous change, and several Masson bodies were found within the resected nodule, but no pathogen, including Coccidioides, was identified by pathological or microbiological examination. On clinical day 53, after confirming the result of VATS and obtaining negative results for the repetitive tests for serum antibody against Coccidioides, we replaced TAZ-PIPC and L-AMB with amoxicillin (AMPC) therapy at 2 g\/day. After 2 months of administration, the pulmonary abscesses were no longer detected on radiological examination. Because of the rarity of her clinical course, we performed molecular identification by PCR amplification and sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene using DNA extracted from the isolates. The universal primers 8UA (5\u2032-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3\u2032) and 1485B (5\u2032-ACGGGCGGTGTGTRC-3\u2032) were used, as described previously (9). We performed a sequencing analysis using a GenBank BLAST search and BiBi (http:\/\/pbil.univ-lyon1.fr\/) phylogenetic tools. The sequence of the 16S rRNA gene showed 99.7% identity (1,403 bp over the entire 1,407-bp fragment) with that of the type strain Actinomyces graevenitzii (CCUG27294; GenBank accession no. AJ 540309). On the basis of this result, we identified the isolate as A. graevenitzii. Actinomyces spp. are the most common commensal anaerobic bacterium in the human oral cavity, and 6 species of this genus are considered pathogenic in humans: A. israeli, A. naeslundii, A. odontolyticus, A. viscosus, A. meyeri, and A. gerencseriae (8, 13). Pulmonary actinomycosis is well known as a cause of chronic infection, and it constitutes 15% of the total burden of actinomycosis in humans (8). The clinical features usually include low-grade inflammation with indolent advancement, which is similar to the presentation of fungal infection or lung neoplasms (8). Several reports (7, 8, 15) found that 25% to 49% of cases of pulmonary actinomycosis were suspected to be lung malignancy upon hospital admission, and the mean duration of illness before a definitive diagnosis was 2 to 6 months. A diagnosis of pulmonary actinomycosis is often confirmed by histological findings, which reflect chronic inflammation consisting of granulomatous change with sulfur granules (6). Bacterial confirmation of a clinicopathological diagnosis is usually obtained in <50% of cases owing to inadequate culturing techniques, previous antibiotic therapy, and bacterial overgrowth (1). Song et al. (15) found that positive culture results were obtained in only 3 of 40 cases of pulmonary actinomycosis. Thus, the diagnosis of conventional pulmonary actinomycosis requires a combination of several factors, including respiratory specimen culture, correlation with clinical and radiological features, histological findings, and response to antibiotic treatment. In addition to these traditional actinomycotic forms, some coryneform anaerobic bacteria have also recently been assigned to the genus Actinomyces by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (4, 5). A. graevenitzii is a newly recognized Actinomyces sp. that was first isolated from 4 clinical human specimens in 1997 by Ramos et al. (11). It is a filamentous Gram-positive rod with no catalase production and is facultatively anaerobic with a distinct biochemical profile (11). Sarkonen et al. isolated A. graevenitzii from failed dental implant surfaces for their study on the distribution of Actinomyces spp. in 33 dental implant fixtures (12). Similar to other Actinomyces spp., A. graevenitzii is possibly a component of the oropharyngeal flora. Very little is known about the clinical features and pathogenesis of A. graevenitzii (14), and only 1 case report has described the disseminated infection of A. graevenitzii, which showed coinfection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (16). Our case presented different clinical features of conventional pulmonary actinomycosis, such as the rapid progression of lung lesions and the lack of specific histological features, including granulomatous change or presence of sulfur granules. Acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis was first suspected because of the patient's travel history to an area of coccidioidomycosis endemicity and the radiological features of multiple round shadows predominantly located in the lower lobes. A histological examination of lung specimens by VATS was necessary for definite differentiation. Although the pathogen could not be identified by histological examination, the quantitative culture of BALF yielding 1 \u00d7 10 CFU\/ml organisms supports the diagnosis of infection by A. graevenitzii as the etiological pathogen present in the patient's lesions. Quantitative culturing of BALF is one of the most reliable methods for differentiating respiratory tract pathogens from colonization related to pneumonia, particular for organisms that can colonize the respiratory tract (2, 10). Because the progression of the lung lesions in our case was more rapid than that of conventional pulmonary actinomycosis, the histological findings revealed acute inflammatory change, which is different from the features of typical pulmonary actinomycosis. As our patient was a 32-year-old previously healthy woman with no known predisposing conditions, the rapid growth of pulmonary actinomycosis in our case was assumed to be due to pathogenic factors rather than host factors. Interestingly, the strain of A. graevenitzii isolated in our case formed molar-tooth-like colonies within 48 to 96 h of incubation. Its growth rate is faster than that of other Actinomyces spp. that can be cultured anaerobically for up to 3 weeks (17). We presume that the rapid growth of A. graevenitzii in aerobic conditions may contribute to rapidly progressive pneumonia. However, the reason for the rapid growth of the pulmonary lesion in this patient is unknown. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing multiple lung abscesses caused by A. graevenitzii, which was diagnosed using a quantitative culture of BALF. In our patient, a PET examination before treatment revealed that the lesions were located only in the lungs. Combined with the onset of clinical manifestation after inhalation of dust on a U.S. beach, it could be considered that the pulmonary multiple abscesses were caused by the entry of the pathogens to the lungs via the respiratory tract as opposed to hematogenous infection. As the habitat of A. graevenitzii is unknown, further caution is necessary for this organism, in particular when differentiation of such cases is required from those of acute pulmonary abscesses developing after the inhalation of soil, such as in cases of acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. In conclusion, we report a unique case of lung abscesses caused by A. graevenitzii that resembled pulmonary coccidioidomycosis in its clinical features and CT findings. Because of its rarity, the documentation of more cases is required to define the pathogenesis of A. graevenitzii."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whether A. graevenitzii is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"32-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-positive","answer_start":9099,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can A. graevenitzii cause?","id":"32-1-3-2","answers":[{"text":"lung abscesses","answer_start":11806,"id":1},{"text":"lung abscesses","answer_start":12621,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about A. graevenitzii's requirement for oxygen?","id":"32-1-3-3","answers":[{"text":"facultatively anaerobic","answer_start":9152,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of A. graevenitzii?","id":"32-1-3-4","answers":[{"text":"rod","answer_start":9113,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"A 38-year-old apparently healthy woman complained of fever and dry cough after visiting Los Angeles, CA.

Thus, there was a possibility of coinfection with other etiologic pathogens. The Coccidioides antibody was not detected on clinical day 32. However, owing to her unique travel history and radiological findings, we could not completely exclude the possibility of acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. Therefore, we performed an additional histological assessment and repetitive examinations for detection of Coccidioides antibody to confirm the diagnosis. On clinical day 36, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was performed to acquire lung tissue. During VATS, the nodule (30 mm) in the right lower lobe was resected and examined. On histological examination, lymphocyte infiltration, fibrous change, and several Masson bodies were found within the resected nodule, but no pathogen, including Coccidioides, was identified by pathological or microbiological examination. On clinical day 53, after confirming the result of VATS and obtaining negative results for the repetitive tests for serum antibody against Coccidioides, we replaced TAZ-PIPC and L-AMB with amoxicillin (AMPC) therapy at 2 g\/day. After 2 months of administration, the pulmonary abscesses were no longer detected on radiological examination. Because of the rarity of her clinical course, we performed molecular identification by PCR amplification and sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene using DNA extracted from the isolates. The universal primers 8UA (5\u2032-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3\u2032) and 1485B (5\u2032-ACGGGCGGTGTGTRC-3\u2032) were used, as described previously (9). We performed a sequencing analysis using a GenBank BLAST search and BiBi (http:\/\/pbil.univ-lyon1.fr\/) phylogenetic tools. The sequence of the 16S rRNA gene showed 99.7% identity (1,403 bp over the entire 1,407-bp fragment) with that of the type strain Actinomyces graevenitzii (CCUG27294; GenBank accession no. AJ 540309). On the basis of this result, we identified the isolate as A. graevenitzii. Actinomyces spp. are the most common commensal anaerobic bacterium in the human oral cavity, and 6 species of this genus are considered pathogenic in humans: A. israeli, A. naeslundii, A. odontolyticus, A. viscosus, A. meyeri, and A. gerencseriae (8, 13). Pulmonary actinomycosis is well known as a cause of chronic infection, and it constitutes 15% of the total burden of actinomycosis in humans (8). The clinical features usually include low-grade inflammation with indolent advancement, which is similar to the presentation of fungal infection or lung neoplasms (8). Several reports (7, 8, 15) found that 25% to 49% of cases of pulmonary actinomycosis were suspected to be lung malignancy upon hospital admission, and the mean duration of illness before a definitive diagnosis was 2 to 6 months. A diagnosis of pulmonary actinomycosis is often confirmed by histological findings, which reflect chronic inflammation consisting of granulomatous change with sulfur granules (6). Bacterial confirmation of a clinicopathological diagnosis is usually obtained in <50% of cases owing to inadequate culturing techniques, previous antibiotic therapy, and bacterial overgrowth (1). Song et al. (15) found that positive culture results were obtained in only 3 of 40 cases of pulmonary actinomycosis. Thus, the diagnosis of conventional pulmonary actinomycosis requires a combination of several factors, including respiratory specimen culture, correlation with clinical and radiological features, histological findings, and response to antibiotic treatment. In addition to these traditional actinomycotic forms, some coryneform anaerobic bacteria have also recently been assigned to the genus Actinomyces by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (4, 5). A. graevenitzii is a newly recognized Actinomyces sp. that was first isolated from 4 clinical human specimens in 1997 by Ramos et al. (11). It is a filamentous Gram-positive rod with no catalase production and is facultatively anaerobic with a distinct biochemical profile (11). Sarkonen et al. isolated A. graevenitzii from failed dental implant surfaces for their study on the distribution of Actinomyces spp. in 33 dental implant fixtures (12). Similar to other Actinomyces spp., A. graevenitzii is possibly a component of the oropharyngeal flora. Very little is known about the clinical features and pathogenesis of A. graevenitzii (14), and only 1 case report has described the disseminated infection of A. graevenitzii, which showed coinfection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (16). Our case presented different clinical features of conventional pulmonary actinomycosis, such as the rapid progression of lung lesions and the lack of specific histological features, including granulomatous change or presence of sulfur granules. Acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis was first suspected because of the patient's travel history to an area of coccidioidomycosis endemicity and the radiological features of multiple round shadows predominantly located in the lower lobes. A histological examination of lung specimens by VATS was necessary for definite differentiation. Although the pathogen could not be identified by histological examination, the quantitative culture of BALF yielding 1 \u00d7 10 CFU\/ml organisms supports the diagnosis of infection by A. graevenitzii as the etiological pathogen present in the patient's lesions. Quantitative culturing of BALF is one of the most reliable methods for differentiating respiratory tract pathogens from colonization related to pneumonia, particular for organisms that can colonize the respiratory tract (2, 10). Because the progression of the lung lesions in our case was more rapid than that of conventional pulmonary actinomycosis, the histological findings revealed acute inflammatory change, which is different from the features of typical pulmonary actinomycosis. As our patient was a 32-year-old previously healthy woman with no known predisposing conditions, the rapid growth of pulmonary actinomycosis in our case was assumed to be due to pathogenic factors rather than host factors. Interestingly, the strain of A. graevenitzii isolated in our case formed molar-tooth-like colonies within 48 to 96 h of incubation. Its growth rate is faster than that of other Actinomyces spp. that can be cultured anaerobically for up to 3 weeks (17). We presume that the rapid growth of A. graevenitzii in aerobic conditions may contribute to rapidly progressive pneumonia. However, the reason for the rapid growth of the pulmonary lesion in this patient is unknown. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing multiple lung abscesses caused by A. graevenitzii, which was diagnosed using a quantitative culture of BALF. In our patient, a PET examination before treatment revealed that the lesions were located only in the lungs. Combined with the onset of clinical manifestation after inhalation of dust on a U.S. beach, it could be considered that the pulmonary multiple abscesses were caused by the entry of the pathogens to the lungs via the respiratory tract as opposed to hematogenous infection. As the habitat of A. graevenitzii is unknown, further caution is necessary for this organism, in particular when differentiation of such cases is required from those of acute pulmonary abscesses developing after the inhalation of soil, such as in cases of acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. In conclusion, we report a unique case of lung abscesses caused by A. graevenitzii that resembled pulmonary coccidioidomycosis in its clinical features and CT findings. Because of its rarity, the documentation of more cases is required to define the pathogenesis of A. graevenitzii."}]},{"title":"Actinomyces graevenitzii bacteremia in a patient with alcoholic liver cirrhosis","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Actinomyces graevenitzii cause?","id":"32-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"septicemia","answer_start":54,"id":1},{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":317,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" We report the first case of Actinomyces graevenitzii septicemia in a patient with alcoholic liver cirrhosis.

They mostly affect immunodeficient or immunocompromised individuals who have other underlying diseases [1]. Once the anatomical barrier is disrupted, Actinomyces accompanied with other pathogenic bacteria in the alimentary tract may invade into adjacent tissues and cause infection [1, 3]. Actinomycosis lesions in humans usually consist of other aerobic or anaerobic species such as A. actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacteria, Bacteroides, Staphylococci, Streptococci, and Enterobacteriaceae [4]. In the present case, corrosive injury throughout the alimentary tract and jejunostomy were considered potential predisposing factors contributing to infection caused by oropharyngeal flora including C. albicans, S. constellatus, and A. odontolyticus. Valour et al. [3] reported that A. gerencseriae and A. israelii are the dominant species isolated from 70% of human forms of actinomycosis. Isolation of A. odontolyticus from liver abscess is exceptionally rare. Moreover, Actinomyces species such as A. odontolyticus, A. meyeri, and A. graevenitzii have been reported to be isolated from the oral cavity (including the tongue surface, tonsillar crypts, and distal esophagus [1]) in one-third of infants at the age of 2 months, and the diversity of Actinomyces increases with age [5]. In particular, A. odontolyticus is the predominant species in the oral cavity of edentulous infants and is the only representative of the genus found at an early age [5, 6]. In our patient, the repair and regeneration of the oral mucosa were similar to those observed in edentulous infants, which may be the reason for the unusual infection caused by A. odontolyticus instead of other Actinomyces species. Actinomyces odontolyticus resides on mucosal surfaces and gains access into the deeper tissue through trauma [1]. Previous esophageal corrosive injury as well as hypoimmunity may have contributed to the severe infection in our patient. Few reports of A. odontolyticus infection shared similar characteristics with our case. In their case report, Pova\u017ean et al. described A. odontolyticus-associated bacteremia in a patient on the 10th hospital day after chemotherapy treatment [7]. A study by Cone et al. summarized 25 cases of A. odontolyticus infection from 1974 to 2003, and five of the infected patients were immunosuppressed [8]. Lopes et al. described peritonitis caused by A. odontolyticus in a patient with underlying gastric perforation [9]. Furthermore, Deivert et al. reported hepatic actinomycosis in an immunocompetent patient who had undergone endoscopic and surgical treatment due to hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm. They presumed that previous interventions provided a portal of entry for bacteria, leading to indolent abscess formation [10]. The application of prolonged therapies with high doses of amoxicillin or penicillin G remains the first-line treatment against Actinomyces. However, some studies have suggested tetracyclines or doxycycline as alternative regimens [11, 12]. Abscess drainage was performed in patients with widespread necrotic tissues or those nonresponsive to antibiotic therapy. In some cases, blood supply to infected sites was insufficient for antibiotics to penetrate; consequently, surgery was considered [11]. However, aggressive treatment was not favored in our patient considering his asthenia condition and personal reasons. In summary, actinomycosis is still a disease that poses a considerable diagnostic challenge in clinical settings. Coinfection of oropharyngeal flora including C. albicans, S. constellatus, and A. odontolyticus is rarely reported. In the present case, a history of GI tract perforation provided crucial clues toward unidentified bacterial diseases among immunocompromised individuals. With the increasing availability of molecular identification techniques, such as MALDI-TOF, the reported number of cases of A. odontolyticus infection is likely to increase. In conclusion, A. odontolyticus should be considered as a causative pathogen in patients with disruption of the GI mucosa. We emphasize the importance of early diagnosis, and delays in treatment can lead to increased morbidity and mortality."}]},{"title":"Actinomyces odontolyticus bacteraemia associated with cervical and mediastinal abscesses in an immunocompetent patient: First reported case in Qatar","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Actinomyces odontolyticus is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"33-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram positive","answer_start":225,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Actinomyces odontolyticus's requirement for oxygen?","id":"33-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"anaerobic","answer_start":240,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Actinomyces odontolyticus normally exist?","id":"33-2-1-3","answers":[{"text":"gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts","answer_start":295,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Actinomyces odontolyticus cause?","id":"33-2-1-4","answers":[{"text":"infections of the central nervous, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems","answer_start":367,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"The Actinomyces species are part of the Actinomyceataceae family that was identified in the 19th century.

Manifestations of infection by A. odontolyticus include thoracic, abdominal, pelvic and central nervous system disease. In the four decades following its isolation, more than 20 cases of invasive infections were reported in multiple geographic locations including the United States and Europe. Majority of the patients were males and the mean age at diagnosis was 50 years [5]. Thoracopulmonary infections due to A. odontolyticus were observed before. The first case of mediastinitis was reported in an immunocompromised patient following a heart-lung transplant and required combined medical and surgical treatment with intravenous penicillin and sternal debridement, respectively. Unfortunately, the patient did not survive the infection [6]. Other intrathoracic infections include pneumonia, empyema and chest wall abscess, with most cases reported in immunocompromised patients. Pneumonia was reported in alcoholic, chronic lung disease and transplant patients [7,8]. Empyema and pulmonary abscess were reported in patients who had underlying pulmonary disease and rheumatoid arthritis [9]. A case of empyema due to A. odontolyticus was also reported in an alcoholic patient who had history of pulmonary tuberculosis and aspergilloma which were treated with pneumonectomy. He underwent drainage, received antimicrobial agents, and responded to treatment [10]. A review of the epidemiology of A. odontolyticus in the state of Qatar between the years 2016 and 2020 revealed 15 cases of bacteraemia. Nine of the patients were females (60%). Mean age at diagnosis was 45 years. 11 patients (73%) had comorbid conditions, including hypertension and diabetes mellitus. 12 patients (80%) had fever on presentation. Two patients (13%) presented with upper respiratory symptoms, two with urinary tract infection and two with lower respiratory complaints, with the remaining patients presenting with constitutional symptoms. Three patients (20%) had orofacial abnormalities in the form of dental caries. Most of the patients (60%) received B-lactam antibiotics. One patient passed away while the other 14 recovered uneventfully with a case fatality rate of 6.6%. In summary, we describe the case of a 32-year-old immunocompetent gentleman who presented with fever and facial swelling seven days after dental extraction and was found to have A. odontolyticus bacteremia associated with cervical collections and descending necrotizing mediastinitis. The patient underwent surgical drainage of the collections in synchrony with intravenous antibiotics and successfully recovered with an excellent clinical outcome. We believe that this case is unique due to multiple reasons. First, case reports of such an extensive cervical and mediastinal involvement in a previously healthy patient following a simple, uncomplicated dental extraction were not published. Secondly, the patient fully recovered despite a relatively short period of antibiotics which was four weeks only, as the usual recommended duration in cases with extensive cervical and thoracic involvement is 3-6 months, even when combined with surgical drainage [11]. In addition, this case highlights the importance of combined medical and surgical management in patients with A. odontolyticus cervical and thoracic collections and how it helps to minimise the duration of antibiotics."}]},{"title":"Secondary peritonitis by Actinomyces odontolyticus","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Actinomyces odontolyticus cause?","id":"33-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"secondary peritonitis","answer_start":223,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Abdominal actinomycosis is a rare infection and the non-recognition of this particular microorganism may led to a prolonged septic process and recurrent disease.

Actinomyces odontolytica is one of the most predominant Actinomyces species in biofilms on tooth surfaces. It is also common in the pharynx and in the distal esophagus. This last site has a relatively stable environment for bacterial colonization by the agent.7 Little is known about the virulence factors of Actinomyces spp., but they are able to evade clearance by the host immune system and, thus, cause a chronic invasion.6 While the vast majority of actinomyces-related infections are polymicrobial (up to 95%),7 in this particularly clinical case, Actinomyces odontolytica was the only identified pathogen. Abscess drainage and long course of antibiotics with penicillin derived antibiotics is the recommended treatment for infections caused by Actinomyces spp.8 Long-term antibiotics (up to a year) may be required.4 This concept is changing, as when optimal surgical resection of infected tissues is achieved, a 3-month course of antibiotics is possible.6 The actual role of surgery usually takes place in cases of extensive necrotic lesions or when antimicrobial therapy fails.7 Actinomyces infections can recur years after initial treatment or may linger asymptomatically if primary treatment is not curative.4 CT-scan or Magnetic Resonance Imaging are used to perform the follow-up on patients with medical treatment.5 We opted to performed a CT-scan three months after surgery, despite her being asymptomatic, to ensure the complete resolution of the collection, which could otherwise lead to recurrence of the infection."}]},{"title":"Sepsis due to Actinomyces odontolyticus as a Rare Complication of Neobladder","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Actinomyces odontolyticus cause?","id":"33-4-1-1","answers":[{"text":"sepsis","answer_start":0,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are A. odontolyticus sensitive to?","id":"33-4-1-2","answers":[{"text":"prolonged course of doxycycline","answer_start":315,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Sepsis due to Actinomyces odontolyticus (A. odontolyticus) is an extremely rare condition that has been reported only a handful of times.

Immunosuppression is essential or having a significant risk factor for infection, including poor oral hygiene, intravenous drug use, and previous mucosal manipulation to develop bacteremia with A. odontolyticus [4\u20136]. Gram staining and pathology of infected tissue is usually more sensitive than the culture since it is often difficult to identify in the lab and can be culture-negative and might remain sterile in more than 50% of cases, but when combined with immunofluorescence technique, they provide a highly specific diagnosis [7]. Beta-lactams and especially penicillin G or amoxicillin are treatments of choice for Actinomyces spp. Hence, they are extremely susceptible to this spectrum of antibiotics. In case of allergies to these antibiotics, doxycycline, clindamycin, ceftriaxone, and macrolides have been successfully used to treat actinomycosis [1]. The duration recommendation of IV antibiotic therapy is 2 to 6 weeks followed by oral antibiotics for 6 to 12 months in certain individuals which are warranted for complicated and invasive cases, immunocompromised patients, and patients with HIV infection. While shorter courses have been successful in treating actinomycosis, this extended therapy is recommended due to the infection tends to recur [8\u201310]. Also, another argument supporting prolonged antibiotic treatment is the tendency of Actinomyces species to form fistulas that have been reported in many case reports [11, 12]. In our case, the patient is immunocompromised and had an invasive surgery (neobladder), which was probably colonized with A. odontolyticus, which has introduced A. odontolyticus to his bloodstream causing sepsis. The current literature provides guideline therapy for a severe localized infection rather than sepsis due to A. odontolyticus. Thus, given the patient's case, we have determined to proceed with 4 weeks of oral and IV antibiotics (doxycycline and ceftriaxone) followed by 6 months of oral antibiotics (doxycycline) with periodic monitoring of his progress. It might have been worth culturing the patient's urine before the neobladder procedure to detect and prevent this infection, especially considering a subsequent immunosuppressant therapy. Although given the incidence rate, it might not be feasible to culture every single patient undergoing a bladder procedure which might raise an already high medical expense in the US. More research is required to maybe develop a sensitive, rapid, and cheap test to detect A. odontolyticus which will help to prevent infection and force early specific treatment. In conclusion, a high suspicion for A. odontolyticus is a cause of sepsis in a patient with high-risk factors. A. odontolyticus could cause an endogenous infection arising from the colonized oral (most common) or urogenital (rare) mucosal membranes when an individual becomes immunocompromised or has a surgical intervention or injury to the mucosal membrane serving as an entrance to the bloodstream. Extended treatment is recommended in most cases given recurrence rate and tendency to cause a fistula especially in immunocompromised patients."}]},{"title":"Lung abscess by Actinomyces odontolyticus and Parvimonas micra co-infection presenting as acute respiratory failure: A case report","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Actinomyces odontolyticus cause?","id":"33-5-1-1","answers":[{"text":"lung abscess","answer_start":805,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Lung abscess is usually caused by polymicrobial infections with anaerobes including Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, and Bacterioides, and aerobes including Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Klebsiella.

These 2 species are often found in the human oropharynx. Pulmonary infection by A odontolyticus or P micra result from the aspiration of these species into the lungs. In this article, we reported a case of lung abscess and respiratory failure in an immune-competent patient caused by these 2 organisms. A prompt diagnosis and an adequate treatment of pulmonary actinomycosis are important even though it is a relatively rare disease with a low mortality rate. The computed tomography findings of pulmonary actinomycosis provide limited information; therefore, the confirmative diagnosis of pulmonary actinomycosis is made by a microscopic examination of pus or lung biopsy sample. A case of pulmonary actinomycosis of periodontal origin by Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces viscosus was reported previously. A case of periodontal disease-associated septic pulmonary embolism by Actinomyces species was also reported, but the specific species was not mentioned. This case highlights the potential pathogenic role of A odontolyticus of periodontal origin as a risk factor for lung infection. The pulmonary infection by P micra is also very rare and P micra is rarely identified in pure culture. This organism usually causes periradicular diseases and periodontitis, with other microorganisms. Poetter et al reported a case of pleural empyema in which P micra was cultured from the pleural pus. In our case, A odontolyticus was identified by the pleural fluid culture and P micra was identified by the blood culture. Although pulmonary actinomycosis is rare and difficult to diagnose, prognosis is relatively good if it is properly treated. There are no guidelines for antibiotics treatment for pulmonary actinomycosis and P micra infection yet. The recommended therapy for these infections is 4 to 6 weeks of intravenous penicillin followed by a 6 to 12 months oral regimen. In this case, the patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics for 15 days along with percutaneous drainage and further treated with oral antibiotics for several months.

Delftia is usually isolatedfrom soil, water, raw milk, animal infections, etc. They only seldom cause human infections, viz., endocarditis, otitis, nosocomial sepsis, peritonitis, urinary tract infections, and keratitis. Notwithstanding few reported cases of delftia-associated keratitis, D. acidovorans is still contemplated as a highly unusual ocular pathogen.[4,5] To the best of our knowledge, our case is the first reported case of delftia- associated endophthalmitis. As only a handful reports of delftia-associated ocular infections exist in literature, the clinical characteristics and the antimicrobial resistance patterns of the organism are relatively unfamiliar. Study of the clinicomicrobiological profile, antibiotic sensitivity pattern, and treatment response of our case is, therefore, essential to understand the risk factors, clinical presentation, and outcome of delftia-related endophthalmitis. Our patient presented with dense fibrinous hypopyon uveitis, had no preexisting ocular or systemic comorbidities. In our case, there was an initial lack of response to intravitreal ceftazidime prior to core vitrectomy. This can be explained probably by the high virulence of the organism, high initial bacterial and toxin loads which had reduced subsequently after core vitrectomy. The patient, therefore, had shown response with clearing of media to intravitreal, topical, and IV ceftazidime. There was no subsequent recurrence of infection till last follow-up. Intraoperative retinal examination showed perivascular retinal exudates. Follow-up evaluation of the fundus at 1 week and at 1 month showed features of retinal vasculitis in the form of sheathing and sclerosis of vessels, few retinal hemorrhages, etc. Retinal vasculitis has been described as a rare manifestation of bacterial endophthalmitis secondary to staphylococcus and streptococcus species.[6,7,8,9] In all these cases, diagnosis of endophthalmitis was heralded by retinal hemorrhages and vasculitis as early hallmark of the diagnosis. Extensive retinal perivasculitis can appear clinically as vascular sheathing as seen in our case. Although such a presentation in endophthalmitis is rare, the visual outcome is often poor. Early intervention in such cases in the form of vitrectomy is beneficial as it reduces bacterial toxins and white blood cells that produce harmful proteolytic enzymes and cause tissue destruction.[6] In hindsight in our case, an earlier vitrectomy would probably have been helpful in improving final outcome but dense vitreous exudates had precluded initial fundus evaluation. Another important differential diagnosis to consider in our case based on the fundus findings is coexistent hemorrhagic occlusive retinal vasculitis (HORV). HORV is described as a type III hypersensitivity or delayed immune reaction akin to leukocytoclastic vasculitis or Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura. It is caused by deposition of immune complexes in vessel walls, with subsequent activation of complement pathway and numerous cytokine cascades. It usually presents between 2 days to 2\u20133 weeks following intraocular use of vancomycin (either intracameral or intravitreal) in the form of retinal vasculitis and small retinal hemorrhages. Retinal hemorrhages in HORV are mostly clustered around occluded venules. Other uncommon manifestations in HORV can be large retinal hemorrhages (> 1 disc diameter), cuffing or sheathing of the venules, macular edema, and whitening. Peripheral retinal involvement is more common.[10] In our case, intraoperative perivenous exudates were noted during initial core vitrectomy on the third day after intravitreal vancomycin and vessel sheathing in the corresponding vessels was documented in fundus photograph on day 7. Retinal hemorrhages in our case were also very few as compared to extensive retinal hemorrhages seen in classical HORV. Vessels around the disc as well as along the temporal arcades showed sheathing and sclerosis in our case while in HORV, involvement of peripheral venules is more common. HORV can occasionally be a dose-dependent response to the drug.[10] Our patient had received two doses of intravitreal vancomycin prior to core vitrectomy which could possibly cause a dose-dependent HORV. However, the onset of clinical findings and spectrum of retinal manifestations in our case are more in favor of endophthalmitis-associated vasculitis. We do acknowledge that HORV cannot be ruled out completely due to overlapping clinical features. Complexity of the diagnosis in our case lies in the intermingled manifestations of both endophthalmitis and HORV. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) can show vascular occlusion corresponding to the areas of hemorrhage in HORV. Also, it can show the status of macular perfusion. Due to logistic reasons, FFA could not be done in our case which is a certain drawback here. In HORV, the initial inflammatory response is followed by the onset of an ischemic drive which results in retinal neovascularization and neovascular glaucoma. Antivascular endothelial growth factor (Anti-VEGF) injections and panretinal photocoagulation may be useful at this stage to prevent these complications of severe retinal ischemia associated with HORV. Rapid development of iris and angle neovascularization leading to secondary neovascular glaucoma is uncommon in postoperative endophthalmitis-associated retinal vasculitis. Hence, close follow-up of our patient to detect these signs at the earliest is recommended. However, till last follow-up, our patient had no evidence of neovascularization or glaucoma. ERM, CME, and temporal disc pallor seen in our case were responsible for poor post surgery visual outcome. Visual evoked potential (VEP) can be done to assess optic nerve function. Optic atrophy will show reduced amplitude and normal latency of P100 in pattern-reversal VEP. Also macular perfusion status can be studied using either FFA or optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Visual outcome for ERM peeling surgery will depend on the macular perfusion status in FFA\/OCTA and optic nerve function in VEP. D. acidovorans usually shows susceptibility only to broad-spectrum cephalosporins, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ureidopenicillins, fluoroquinolones, and tetracyclines but it is often resistant to aminoglycosides. Therefore, timely intervention, isolation of the organism, identification of the species, and antimicrobial sensitivity testing are all mandatory to decide the most appropriate antimicrobial therapy.[2,3] On biochemical testing, the organism isolated in our case was urease nonproducer, kligler iron agar nonfermenter and showed an orange indole reaction test. On addition of Kovac's reagent in nutrient agar, the colonies turned orange. This occurs due to production of anthranilic acid from tryptophan on addition of Kovac's reagent which subsequently imparts the characteristic \u201cpumpkin orange\u201d color to the media.[3] Further identification test using VITEK2 colorimetric card (BioMerieux) confirmed the organism as Delftia acidovorans. The organism in our case showed sensitivity to ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, cefoperazone\/sulbactam, meropenam, and chloramphenicol; and responded to treatment with intravitreal, intravenous, and topical ceftazidime after core vitrectomy.

In this instance, the prompt removal of the line combined with appropriate use of antimicrobials to which the organism was sensitive resulted in a positive outcome for the patient who was well enough to be discharged home 10 days after he was first admitted to hospital."}]},{"title":"Delftia acidovorans pneumonia with lung cavities formation","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Delftia acidovorans cause?","id":"35-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"cavitary pneumonia","answer_start":1201,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"A 52-year-old female patient was admitted to our clinic with complaints of cough, sputum, fever and fatigue.

A pulmonary cavity is the common finding of a wide variety of the pathological process which is affecting the lung. Since some diseases are more associated with the development of the pulmonary cavity the evaluation of the cavity helps to clinicians in the differential diagnosis  12 . According to the developmental periods, it is recommended to divide the cavities into two groups. Some cavities develop within the 12 weeks, while others require more than 12 weeks  13 . A rapidly developing cavity (<12 weeks) strongly suggests an infectious or acute cause. However, the cavities those had a more chronic or silent development (>12 weeks) support the presence of chronic infections, autoimmune conditions, or malignancy. Nevertheless, there may be a significant change in the temporal development of cavitary disease processes, depending on both the patient's immune status and comorbidities  13 . We suspected that the patient has an infection because the patient's complaints had started three weeks ago and she had been receiving immunosuppressive treatment for a long time. Moreover, the radiological findings also suggested the possibility of cavitary lung disease in addition to the suspicion about infectious diseases. There are some reports of Delftia acidovorans that cause infection in humans  2    5 . However, in the literature, we could not find a study reported that Delftia acidovorans causes pulmonary cavitary disease. The vasculitis syndromes were not considered among the preliminary diagnoses since the markers of cavitary pulmonary vasculitis syndromes were negative.  The cavity development is more common in some disease such as tuberculosis and Klebsiella pneumoniae infections  12 . Additionally, some fungal infections may also cause cavity development in the lung  12 . However, in our patient's serial sputum microscopy the acid-fast bacilli were not detected. Bronchoscopic fluid analysis has been reported to be useful when a specific infectious agent, such as fungal and tuberculosis infection, is suspected in immunocompromised patients  14    15 . Therefore, we also performed bronchoscopy for further analysis. The galactomannan antigen was found negative in serum and bronchoscopic fluid.  In a large-sample study using PCR for validity and comparing Biotyper (MALDI-TOF MS; matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry) and Phoenix methods, the urine-isolated bacteria was accurately identified 99.9% and 99.5% at the genus level, 99.1% and 98.5% at the species level  7 . Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the Phoenix automated microbiology systems can be used for in the majority of strains encountered in a university-based laboratory to evaluate the identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) performances  8 . For this reason, we used this system to evaluate the identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility test. By bronchial lavage fluid culture and automatized bacteria validation test Delftia acidovorans was detected.  Bilgin et al.  2 , reported a case of Delfia acidovorence pneumonia in a patient with neutropenia. However, in their case, there was no pulmonary cavitary involvement  2 . Ta\u015f et al.  5 , reported that they detect Delftia acidovorans in deep tracheal aspiration culture of a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This patient with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection died despite treatment  5 . The reported cases of Delfia infection consist mostly of patients with immunodeficiency  2    16    17  However, there are also cases reported in immunocompetent patients  3    5    18 . Khan et al.  3 , reported a case of Delftia acidovorans bacteremia, in a four-year-old immunocompetent patient with pulmonary abscess. Patel et al.  14 , reported a case of catheter-related septic pulmonary embolism, caused by Delftia acidovorans in a 49-year-old woman with vertebral osteomyelitis. However, there was no cavitary pulmonary infiltrates in this patient CT images, and the CT scan revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules and pleural effusion. For an accurate diagnosis and treatment, the elimination of the contaminations is very important. Before examining the patient sample, we took a swab sample from the automated system in order to eliminate contamination. There was not a bacterial growth in the culture of this swab sample. Additionally, this organism couldn't be isolated from the culture of other patients. Moreover, the patient's clinical features, laboratory, and radiological findings indicated the presence of a pulmonary infection. These points supported the fact that this organism wasn't an environmental contaminant for our patient.  In Latin America, Galles et al.  19 , examined a total of 176 unusual, non-facultative gram-negative bacteria, including four Delftia acidovorans isolates. In this multicenter study, there was poor in vitro efficacy with aminoglycosides. Although the information on Delftia acidovorans sensitivity is limited, Delftia acidovorans is generally known to be susceptible to broad-spectrum cephalosporins, piperacillin, aztreonam, carbapenems, quinolones, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  19 . Similarly, in our case, an effective response was obtained with piperacillin\/tazobactam treatment (MIC \u22644\/4\/g\/mL). Since Delftia acidovorans isolates are resistant to aminoglycosides, type determination is important for appropriate treatment  20 . Similarly, in our case, the bacterium was found to be resistant to aminoglycosides (MIC <16 \u03bcg\/dL for amikacin). According to our literature research, the case presented here will be the first example of pulmonary cavitary infiltrates due to Delftia acidovorans."}]}]},{"species":"Actinomyces viscosus","docs":[{"title":"Actinomyces viscosus causing disseminated disease in a patient on methotrexate","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of drugs are A. viscosus sensitive to?","id":"36-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"penicillin-based regimen","answer_start":664,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Actinomyces viscosus cause?","id":"36-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"disseminated actinomycosis with lung and brain lesions","answer_start":394,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Actinomyces viscosus normally exist?","id":"36-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"oropharynx of humans","answer_start":293,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Actinomycosis is an uncommon infectious disease caused predominantly by Actinomyces israelii.

Only a few cases have been reported in humans where it was mostly associated with subacute infections including cervicofacial, pulmonary, perioperative endophthalmitis, endocarditis & branchial cyst infections but never a disseminated infection. Two serotypes of A. viscosus have been described, serotype 1 and serotype 2. Serotype 1 was isolated from hamster and animals whereas serotype 2 from humans [1,2,7,9]. To the best of our knowledge, our case is the first reported case of a disseminated actinomycosis secondary to A. viscosus in existing literature. Methotrexate could be a reason for the dissemination as its use is associated with immunosuppression [12]. Disseminated actinomyces infection has been seen usually with A. israelii, A. meyeri, A. odontolyticus [4,6,8]. Most actinomycotic infections are polymicrobial and include other flora such as Actinobacillus, Fusobacterium, and Peptostreptococcus species [6]. There is no clinical characteristic of A. viscosus infection that can distinguish it from other actinomyces species. However, microbiologically A. viscosus is a gram-positive, non-acid fast, facultative anaerobe that grows as acute-angle branching filamentous rods. Unlike other species which are catalase-negative and indole-positive, A. viscosus colonies are catalase-positive and indole-negative [1]. The diagnosis is frequently made by histopathological examination of excised tissue, which has a characteristic \u201csulfur granule\u201d appearance grossly and forms white to gray colonies. Gram stain shows branching gram-positive rods that grow anaerobically. \u201cSulfur granules\u201d contain filamentous or club-shaped structures which are Gram-positive but non-acid fast. This feature differentiates actinomycosis from nocardiosis [3,8] Prolonged antibiotic therapy with penicillin or amoxicillin for six to twelve months is required since it has poor drug penetration into fibrotic lesions. Adjunct therapy with surgical or percutaneous drainage or excision are done when indicated [6]. In penicillin-allergic patients, tetracyclines, erythromycin, clindamycin, cephalosporins, and Chloramphenicol can be used as alternatives [5]. Even though this patient was immunocompromised and the lesions were disseminated, antibiotic treatment proved to be effective. Actinomycosis usually shows a good response to antibiotic therapy. However, careful treatment and follow-up are required, especially in immunocompromised patients. In summary, we describe a case initially presumed as lung cancer with brain metastasis in a patient who presented with generalized weakness, later confirmed as an uncommon disseminated infection due to A. viscosus. Our case not only highlights an unusual presentation of rare infection caused by A. viscosus but also signifies the importance of multidisciplinary involvement in the management of complicated cases and is, therefore, worth reporting in the field of medical literature. Physicians should be aware of the various species and presentations of Actinomyces infection."}]},{"title":"Clinical Characteristics of Actinomyces viscosus Bacteremia","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Actinomyces viscosus cause?","id":"36-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia with cutaneous actinomycosis","answer_start":744,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Background and Objectives: Actinomyces species are part of the normal flora of humans and rarely cause disease. It is an uncommon cause of disease in humans. The clinical features of actinomycosis have been described, and various anatomical sites (such as face, bones and joints, respiratory tract, genitourinary tract, digestive tract, central nervous system, skin, and soft tissue structures) can be affected. It is not easy to identify actinomycosis because it sometimes mimics cancer due to under-recognition. As new diagnostic methods have been applied, Actinomyces can now more easily be identified at the species level. Recent studies have also highlighted differences among Actinomyces species. We report a case of Actinomyces viscosus bacteremia with cutaneous actinomycosis. Materials and Methods: A 66 years old male developed fever for a day with progressive right lower-leg erythematous swelling. Blood culture isolates yielded Actinomyces species, which was identified as Actinomyces viscosus by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. In addition, we searched for the term Actinomyces or actinomycosis cross-referenced with bacteremia or \u201cblood culture\u201d or \u201cblood stream\u201d from January 2010 to July 2020.

Poor oral hygiene was confirmed by dental examination. There were no disease relapses during the following period. Most cases of actinomycosis can be treated with penicillin. However, clinical alertness, risk factor evaluation, and identification of Actinomyces species can prevent inappropriate antibiotic or intervention. We also compiled a total of 18 cases of Actinomyces bacteremia after conducting an online database search. Conclusions: In summary, we describe a case of fever and progressive cellulitis. Actinomyces species was isolated from blood culture, which was further identified as Actinomyces viscosus by 16S rRNA sequencing. The cellulitis improved after pathogen-directed antibiotics.

Then, shortly afterward in 1890, Actinomyces israelii was discovered in humans [2]. These bacteria are Gram-positive, filamentous, and rod-shaped. They are mostly facultative anaerobic organisms, which normally colonize the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, colon, and vagina [3,4]. However, only a handful of species are known to be associated with human infections such as A. israelii, A. meyeri, A. neuii, and A. turicensis [3,4]. Odontomyces viscosus was first found in the periodontal plaque of hamsters in 1958. The species was classified and named \u201cActinomyces viscosus\u201d [5,6]. The two closely related species A. viscosus and A. naeslundii showed high phenotypic and serological relatedness and could be isolated from dental plaque and mucosa samples [7]. A. naeslundii Serotype II was renamed \u201cActinomyces oris\u201d in 2009 [8], and human strains which have been assigned to A. viscosus are likely members of A. oris [9]. Despite being a commensal bacterium in the majority of human adults with teeth, A. viscosus has rarely been reported to cause disease [10]. Actinomyces was redefined to include catalase-positive organisms in 1969 [11]. Unlike other species which are catalase-negative and indole-positive, these colonies are catalase-positive and indole-negative. Actinomyces species can be cultured on blood agar (BA) with selective nutritional requirements [12]. In the 1980s, a new standard of 16S rRNA gene sequencing for bacterial identification was introduced and also used to establish the genotypic taxonomy [13,14,15]. In order to identify bacteria at the genus and species level, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology to quickly perform reliable identification of bacteria in this case. Evidence of actinomycosis infection is based on accurate identification of Actinomyces species. Therefore, accuracy is a key factor in preventing unnecessary invasive intervention and facilitates the selection of proper treatment [16,17]. The most common pathogenic actinomycosis species include A. viscosus and A. meyeri [2,3,4,12]. According to some reviews, A. israelii and A. meyeri have been identified as frequently encountered specimens from periappendiceal abscesses and abdominal actinomycosis [12,18]. Cutaneous actinomycosis is uncommon in clinical practice [19] and is usually a secondary infectious process with an underlying focus in deeper tissues [20], or it may appear as a result of hematogenous spread from an actinomycotic lesion elsewhere in the body [4]. In cutaneous actinomycosis, the commonly found causative organisms were A. meyeri and A. viscosus according to previous reports [4,12]. Oral hygiene is a recognized risk factor for the development of cutaneous actinomycosis [21]. According to a literature review of original clinical studies on Actinomyces, this species can be a source of invasive disease when superadded by periodontal disease and poor oral hygiene, leading to the development of infections. Although oral cervicofacial actinomycosis is the common form, Actinomyces can also result in infection of the thoracic, abdominopelvic, cutaneous, musculoskeletal system, pericardium, and central nervous system, as well as in disseminated disease [3]. In the present review, we report a case with A. viscosus bacteremia and cellulitis in a patient with poor oral hygiene, and we gathered this information to provide a comprehensive and microbiologically consistent overview of the A. viscosus bacteremia and cutaneous actinomycosis in human infections."},{"qas":[{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of A. viscosus?","id":"36-2-3-1","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":4339,"id":1},{"text":"opportunistic pathogens","answer_start":24,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Actinomyces viscosus sensitive to?","id":"36-2-3-2","answers":[{"text":"penicillin and beta-lactam antibiotics","answer_start":1842,"id":1},{"text":"carbapenems, tetracyclines, clindamycin, and vancomycin","answer_start":2253,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Actinomyces species are opportunistic pathogens and capable of causing disease, which often invade the body following the disruption of mucosal barriers [4,8]. There are nine Actinomyces species that are commonly found in the oral cavity, namely, A. israelii, A. viscosus, A. odontolyticus, A. naeslundii, A. georgiae, A. gerensceriae, A. meyeri, A. radicidentis, and A. graevenitzii [52,53]. A. israelii is known as the most common bacterium associated with classical actinomycosis, which has been linked with dental abscesses and oral infections [12]. In this study, we reviewed cases of Actinomyces bacteremia in databases and found that 15 of 18 patients had at least one risk factor. According to the analysis, seven patients were relatively immunocompromised (one alcoholic liver cirrhosis, four diabetes mellitus, one preterm labor, and one monoclonal gammopathy). Seven cases had a procedure-related risk factor (two IUD, one TVOR, one colonoscopy, and one surgery), and four cases had evidence of poor oral hygiene. The diagnostic method and basic characteristics of Actinomyces bacteremia cases reported from 2010 January to 2020 July are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2. A phenotypic test is an easily applied, rapid, and cost-efficient tool for identification of Actinomyces species. The classical method is based on phenotypic tests such as gas production from glucose, urease, catalase, and acid production [8]. However, it is difficult to determine the taxon when species have the same characteristics [4]. With the low cost of 16S rRNA sequencing in recent years, it is possible to use this reliable and accurate approach currently available in clinical practice. In this study, we used 16S sequencing to confirm the pathogen, which was identified as Actinomyces viscosus. In general, Actinomyces species are susceptible to penicillin and beta-lactam antibiotics [54]. Some studies reported that actinomycosis can be treated successfully with ceftriaxone [23,27,54], but several case reports noted that some isolates were resistant to ceftriaxone, such as A. europaeus and A. graevenitzii [12,54]. A retrospective assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates showed that the Actinomyces spp. were also susceptible to carbapenems, tetracyclines, clindamycin, and vancomycin as alternative treatments [54]. However, another interesting observation was that Actinomyces isolates were resistant to doxycycline [12] and clindamycin, showing a high range from 30% to 80% with poor susceptibility rates [55]. Additionally, in the present study, it was found that A. meyeri and A. odontolyticus were resistant to tetracycline and vancomycin; in most Actinomyces spp., isolates showed high resistance to metronidazole and quinolones as \u201cintrinsic resistance\u201d [55]. Therefore, the susceptibility profiles of Actinomyces are important as they help to inform the selection of an appropriate treatment [54]. In our study, the patient recovered well after intravenous ampicillin treatment. A recent study on the healthy human oral microbiome showed that Actinomyces species are part of the oral flora in Taiwanese populations [56]. Human isolates of Actinomyces viscosus showed high phenotypic and serological relatedness to A. naeslundii [57]. Therefore, we used 16S rRNA sequencing analysis for identification of A. viscosus; it was also possible to differentiate it from other closely related species in the genera Arcanobacterium and Actinobaculum [58,59]. The oral cavity could be considered a causative factor in human actinomycosis [60]. The isolation of Actinomyces spp. from blood culture is traditionally regarded as clinically significant [61]. However, the possibility of contaminants does exist [62]. Sound clinical judgment based on the presence of risk factors is essential to interpretate the results. According to the literature review of original clinical studies on Actinomyces, this species can become pathological when superadded by periodontal disease and poor oral hygiene, leading to the development of infections. The mucosal barrier is disrupted by triggering factors such as plaque, tooth cavities, and periodontitis in the case of oral infections [19,63,64]. In this study, our patient had poor oral hygiene and chronic periodontitis, which were considered risk factors. A. viscosus is an opportunistic pathogen in the oral cavity. This may have been the source of bacteremia in our patient, who had hematogenous spreading, which led to cellulitis of the right lower leg. Furthermore, immunocompromised patients, such as those with diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), etc., patients who have undergone a surgical or invasive procedure, and patients with local tissue damage, are also traditionally considered to be at greater risk for actinomycosis."}]}]},{"species":"Actinomyces israelii","docs":[{"title":"Pyogenic granuloma associated with Actinomyces israelii","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Actinomyces israelii cause?","id":"37-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"pyogenic granuloma","answer_start":230,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Pyogenic granulomas are a form of nonneoplastic inflammatory hyperplasia that respond to various stimuli such as chronic local irritation, trauma, and hormonal changes.1 A case of infection of Actinomyces israelii with associated pyogenic granuloma formation is described.

A cerebral abscess caused by Actinomyces israelii was detected in a 10-year-old boy with congenital heart disease and successfully treated with neurosurgical excision followed by a 4-week course of ceftriaxone [7]. The process of intracerebral abscess formation goes through four stages. The first stage (early cerebritis) is characterized with poorly demarked surrounding tissue and presence of a perivascular infiltration. In the second stage (late cerebritis), a reticular matrix and development of a necrotic center are seen. In the third stage (early incapsulation), a necrotic center with neovascularisation is observed. The fourth stage (late incapsulation) differentiates clear distinction between the collagen capsule, a necrotic center, and reactive gliosis around the capsule [8]. The patients have signs of increased intracranial pressure such as headaches, nausea, and lethargy, followed by high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and leukocytosis over 10,000, negative hemoculture and over 90% positive lumbar puncture. Once the infection is established, spread through surrounding tissues begins with possible hematogenous dissemination at any stage of disease. In most cases of a central nervous system (CNS) involvement, it is thought to have spread from an extracranial source. When the infection has a cervico-facial localization, the principal route of entry may be the oral cavity via periapical dental granuloma [9,10,11]. In the early stages of abscess development (stages one and two) and an abscesses size of under 2.5 cm in diameter, the medical therapy is the method of choice. Antibiotic treatment is based on high doses of penicillin for a long time (6-12 months). However, Jamjoom et al. reported three cases cured by shorter antibiotic treatment [12]. The surgical intervention should be reserved for abscesses larger than 2.5 cm and in all lesions with presence of a capsule. In our case, a craniotomy was performed based on the neuroradiological findings of perifocal edema and presence of a capsule."}]}]},{"species":"Actinomyces oris","docs":[{"title":"Bacterial Endocarditis Caused by Actinomyces oris: First Reported Case and Literature Review","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Actinomyces oris is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"38-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-positive","answer_start":24,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Actinomyces oris's requirement for oxygen?","id":"38-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"facultative anaerobic","answer_start":39,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Actinomyces oris?","id":"38-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"bacilli","answer_start":61,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Actinomyces species are gram-positive, facultative anaerobic bacilli.

Infective endocarditis caused by Actinomyces species is rare with only 30 reported cases since 1939. To date, 14 species of Actinomyces have been implicated in endocarditis: Actinomyces bovis, Actinomyces graminis, Actinomyces septicus, Actinomyces muris, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces meyeri, Actinomyces pyogenes, Actinomyces funkei, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Actinomyces neuii, Actinomyces georgiae, Actinomyces turicensis, and Actinomyces naeslundii. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first reported case of A oris as a causative organism of infective endocarditis. Actinomyces oris is one of the predominant organisms colonizing the oral cavity and plays a role in dental plaque formation. This species previously belonged to the A naeslundii\/A viscosus group. However, the multilocus sequence analysis based on sequence comparisons for partial gene sequences has further speciated and proposed A oris as a new species of Actinomyces. Furthermore, a phylogenetic tree based on 16s rRNA gene sequence of the genus Actinomyces has clearly showed that A oris is genetically different from A naeslundii and A viscosus. However, it is also possible that A viscosus or A naeslundii in previous reports might be actually A oris as the technology at that time might not be able to differentiate these species. In a literature review, 31 cases of endocarditis caused by Actinomyces spp have been reported since 1939 including our case (Table 2). Of the previous case reports of actinomycotic endocarditis, there was only one pediatric case. The median age was 48 years (34-65 years), and 22 patients (71%) were male. Sixteen patients (52%) had underlying cardiac disease. Seven patients (22.6%) had a history of recent dental procedure or presence of dental caries. Twenty-eight cases (90.3%) involved a native valve. Of these 31 cases, 8 patients (25.8%) required cardiac surgery. The overall mortality associated with actinomycotic endocarditis was 25.8% (8 of 31 patients). Clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcome of patients with Actinomyces endocarditis are described in Table 3.

Clinical Characteristics, Treatment, and Outcome of Endocarditis Cases Caused by Actinomyces Species. Similar to the present case, most of the patients in this review presented with subacute or chronic endocarditis that usually involved native heart valves. Predisposing factors for actinomycotic endocarditis include periodontal diseases or dental procedures in association with a preexisting cardiac valvular defect. Our patient might have had underlying rheumatic heart disease that he had not been aware of. This is a known risk factor for infective endocarditis. Additionally, the pathological findings from the MV and AV were suggestive of post-inflammatory change, which can be seen in rheumatic heart disease. Furthermore, the presence of dental caries, in this case, might be an attributable factor for developing infective endocarditis since Actinomyces species habitually colonize in the oral cavity. The diagnosis of actinomycotic endocarditis primarily depends on the identification of Actinomyces species from blood cultures, which may be recognized within 5 to 7 days. However, the cultures should be held for up to 4 weeks to improve the yield of diagnosis. Moreover, blood cultures may fail to identify the organism since these facultative anaerobes require special specimen handling with minimal exposure to oxygen and a need for a CO2-enriched environments. The definitive diagnosis of Actinomyces spp has always been challenging. Over the past decade, 16s rRNA sequencing has been widely used for bacterial identification and the discovery of novel bacteria, especially uncultivable or slow-growing bacteria. This method has led to the classification and identification of Actinomyces spp, differentiating Actinomyces spp from other gram-positive anaerobic bacilli. However, accurate identification of certain species of actinomycosis is still problematic. MALDI-TOF MS has emerged as a rapid and effective method for bacterial identification with the ability to speciate closely related organisms. A previous study has demonstrated the performance of MALDI-TOF MS in identification of endocarditis due to A neuii. As in this case, MALDI-TOF MS was used to confirm the etiologic organism in subacute endocarditis. The choice and optimal duration of antibiotics in actinomycotic endocarditis remains unclear. Actinomyces species are generally susceptible to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Penicillin or cephalosporins have been considered to be first-line agents for the treatment of actinomycosis. According to previous reports, most patients with endocarditis tended to receive high doses and prolonged antibiotic therapy. In our literature review, duration of antibiotic therapy ranged from 1 to 12 months. Alternative agents, including chloramphenicol, erythromycin, clindamycin, doxycycline, or vancomycin, have been shown in vitro to be active against these organisms. In the present case, the patient was successfully treated with 6 weeks of intravenous ampicillin followed by oral amoxicillin for a planned 12-month course. In conclusion, we describe a case of native valve A oris endocarditis that was successfully treated with intravenous ampicillin and oral amoxicillin and surgical valve replacement. Although infective endocarditis caused by Actinomyces spp is rare, it could be considered in a case of culture-negative endocarditis since the clinical features might be indistinguishable from other bacterial endocarditis. Additionally, MALDI-TOF MS could be a useful diagnostic tool for the identification of Actinomyces spp to improve the accuracy of speciation and diagnosis."}]}]},{"species":"Chryseobacterium gleum","docs":[{"title":"Chryseobacterium gleum Isolation from Respiratory Culture Following Community-Acquired Pneumonia","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can C. gleum cause?","id":"39-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"urinary tract infections and pneumonia","answer_start":337,"id":1},{"text":"respiratory infection","answer_start":1554,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are C. gleum sensitive to?","id":"39-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole","answer_start":1609,"id":1},{"text":"fluoroquinolones, piperacillin-tazobactam, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole","answer_start":1821,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Patient: Male, 61-year-old Final Diagnosis: Hospital-acquired infection Symptoms: Fatigue \u2022 fever \u2022 respiratory distress Medication: \u2014 Clinical Procedure: Respiratory culture with gram stain Specialty: Infectious Diseases Rare disease Chryseobacterium gleum (C. gleum) is a rare but concerning device-associated infection that can cause urinary tract infections and pneumonia.

The use of BiPAP and VentiMask have been described, with the hypothesis that these devices may harbor C. gleum. Exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics, including treatment with vancomycin and ceftriaxone, has also been noted [6]. Our patient had several of these risk factors, including possible immune function compromise secondary to his malnourished state, antibiotic exposure, and use of BiPAP and VentiMask during portions of his admission. He did not, however, have an indwelling catheter or a prolonged hospital or medical intensive care unit stay. It is a possibility that our patient was exposed to C. gleum while in the medical intensive care unit on either BiPAP or hi-flow. No cultures of the devices were taken, so the mechanism of exposure cannot be definitively determined. The patient had no prior respiratory cultures, so it is unknown if he was a carrier of C. gleum. To the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence of a respiratory carrier state of C. gleum documented in the literature. A true pathogen must be differentiated from a colonizer. Colonization occurs when microbes exist on a carrier without causing infection [7], and is common in the upper respiratory tract, where large quantities of different bacteria exist [8]. Repeating a sample collection supports the notion that an isolated microbe is causing a patient\u2019s infection, but no specific guidelines for repeat cultures exist in the literature [5]. Although our patient\u2019s sputum showed numerous C. gleum, only 1 sample was obtained throughout his stay. The patient\u2019s worsening clinical picture, despite broad-spectrum antibiotics for over a week, his rapid improvement following trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole therapy, coupled with the various risk factors for non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, collectively support the theory that the C. gleum isolate was pathogenic. The isolated strain showed susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, but was otherwise resistant to the remaining tested antibiotics as listed in Table 1, with breakpoint diffusions based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli protocol. While resistance to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and colistin is well documented within the genus, the isolate\u2019s resistance to ceftazidime and cefepime are noteworthy and concerning. A summary of other available case reports documenting susceptibilities and treatment of respiratory C. gleum pathogenic isolates is described in Table 2.

While the organism has consistently shown susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in various case reports, fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin or piperacillin-tazobactam (or a combination of these agents) are typically used for therapy (see Table 2).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of respiratory tract infection due to C. gleum in Saudi Arabia. It is also the first report of association between Chryseobacterium infection and nephrotic syndrome. This is a noteworthy case since Chryseobacterium species are ubiquitous in nature, are not part of human flora, and can cause infections in hospitalized patients with underlying disease [1], [2], [4]. In addition, they are resistant to chlorination and are found on wet services of medical devices and water systems. Therefore, medical devices such as humidifiers, intubation tubes, and ventilators are important sources for nosocomial infections caused by Chryseobacterium spp [1], [13]. VAP incidence is estimated to be 10\u201325% in Saudi Arabia and is associated with 25\u201350% mortality rates of these cases [14]. Environmental and mechanical ventilator samples did not grow any C. gleum in this case. However, intubation is a well known risk factor for VAP caused by Chryseobacterium. Therefore, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis as a causing agent whenever a VAP case is encountered. Patients with nephrotic syndrome suffer from infections due to the loss of proteins including immunoglobulins in urine [15]. This may explain in part why the patient developed pneumonia and previous multiple episodes of septicemia. This study suggests that nephrotic syndrome can be a risk factor for C. gleum infections. C. gleum has the ability of biofilm formation which can play a significant role in the establishment of infections and resistance to wide variety of antimicrobial agents [7]. The choice of antibiotic agent for treatment is not well established since there are insufficient data regarding the minimum inhibitory concentration profile. In addition, there are no CLSI guidelines for Chryseobacterium [10], [11]. According to report from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program (1997\u20132001), Chryseobacterium represented 0.27% of the studied non fermentative Gram-negative rods and 0.03% of all bacterial isolates [10]. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and newer generations of quinolones (levofloxacin, garenoxacin, and gatifloxacin) were the most active agents against Chryseobacterium [10]. Our data correlated with this study where C. gleum strain was susceptible to levofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

C. gleum has been associated with various healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) including septicemia, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, wound infections, peritonitis, and meningitis [3-7]. The Sentry Antimicrobial Surveillance program sponsored by JMI Laboratories was first established in 1997 and is the longest-running surveillance program that monitors the changes in resistance patterns of pathogens worldwide through centralized testing. In the 1997-2001 Sentry dataset, Chryseobacterium was recognized for the first time as a medically relevant bacterial species, constituting 0.27% of non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli found in samples from 16 countries. The highest prevalence was among the elderly. Among the 50 isolates, the most common pathogenic member of this genus was C. meningosepticum (24 isolates - 48%) while C. gleum (two isolates - 4%) was the most infrequent [8]. In the 2013-2017 Sentry dataset, C. gleum constituted only 13 of 151,572 isolates worldwide. Out of 13, 11 were isolated from the United States and 10 of them were HAIs. HAIs are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting 2 million patients annually, causing 90,000 deaths and loss of 28-45 billion US dollars [9].

Environmental studies have shown that they can thrive in chlorinated water and wet surfaces and are not a part of normal flora. Risk factors that are associated with infection include prolonged hospital stay especially in ICUs, indwelling devices, and exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. A study from Taiwan has shown that they can form biofilms on medical devices (respirators, intubation tubes, syringes, etc.) or surgically implanted devices (intravenous catheters or prosthetic valves) which contributes to their pathogenic potential [10]. Our patient presumably acquired the infection while in the ICU as his initial respiratory cultures were negative and he responded to steroids, but during the second admission to the ICU, he was unresponsive to steroids and had rapid respiratory deterioration. There were no cultures obtained from the medical devices, but the patient was on contact and droplet precautions during the entire hospital stay which prevented the nosocomial spread of bacteria to other patients in the ICU. Chryseobacterium spp has been reported to be resistant to several antibiotics such as aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, colistin, tetracycline, clindamycin, erythromycin, teicoplanin, and beta-lactams. Bellasis et al. found that these bacteria are resistant to beta-lactams as they can chromosomally encode class A beta-lactamases (CGA-1) [11]. In our case, the bacteria were susceptible to most groups of antibiotics including cephalosporins as opposed to the other two reported cases from Unites States [12,13]. Historically, the choice of antibiotics is not well established because of the insufficient data on minimum inhibitory concentration and no Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CSLI) or EUCAST (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) guidelines. In SENTRY studies and most of the reported cases, TMP-SMX and quinolones (Levofloxacin, Gatifloxacin, Garenoxacin) were used to treat the infection. We initially treated our patient with tigecycline and SXT and then Levofloxacin for three days before he opted for comfort care. We did not have a good clinical response because, in most other studies, patients were treated with Levofloxacin for at least 7-10 days. Other causes could be worsening of the underlying ILD due to bacterial proliferation leading to further inflammation and lung damage or poor immune response due to underlying hematologic malignancy.

C. matruchotii has previously been found in a morphological unit in tooth biofilms, termed \u201ccorn cobs\u201d, formed by the filamentous organism with adherent cocci [2]. Recent studies redefined the bacterial organization in the supragingival biofilm as a hedgehog-like structure and suggested that C. matruchotii is a nucleating species in the bacterial community [3]. Morphological characterization of the hedgehog structure has revealed a network in which Streptococcus and Actinomyces species attach to the C. matruchotii filaments, with more cocci adhering to its distal filament tips [3]. Other species in the hedgehog structure belong to Porphyromonas, Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Neisseria, Fusobacterium, and Leptotrichia genera [3]. However, Kolenbrander and Williams [4] did not observe any interaction between C. matruchotii and Actinomyces viscosus (strains MG1, T14V, and T14AV), Actinomyces naeslundii (strains ATCC 12104, I, and W1544), or Streptococcus spp. (strains DL1, Challis, Hi, 34, and J22). Kim and Koo [5] recently confirmed that the corncob, hedgehog, and seaweed spatial architectures are common, but also documented a dome-like structure in caries-active toddlers [6]. Several 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies have found C. matruchotii among the most prevalent species in the adult human oral core microbiome, as they are present in virtually all subjects in significant abundance [7,8]. This was also confirmed in metaproteome and metatranscriptome studies [9,10]. Furthermore, C. matruchotii represents a large proportion of the protein activity in human tooth biofilms [9,10] and secretes a 50 amino acid membrane-associated proteolipid inducing calcium precipitation [11], as well as an oxidoreductase (MdbA) that catalyzes a disulfide bond formation in vitro, which may be utilized to catalyze oxidative protein folding and stabilization [12]. The relationship between C. matruchotii and oral health remains unclear. Some studies report C. matruchotii to be enumerated in caries-free children and young adults [7,13], and reduced in caries progression [13]. However, a yet unnamed Corynebacterium phylotype has been found to be among the predominant species related to caries progression in the primary and permanent dentition [14]. Similarly, some studies have found an association between C. matruchotii and periodontal health [15,16], but one study reported that C. matruchotii is more than twice as prevalent in smokers, indicating an association or co-appearance with periodontal disease, which is more common in smokers [17]. Thus, support is growing for a possible key role of C. matruchotii in oral biofilm formation, but much remains to be understood about its role in oral microbiota biology and oral health. The aims of this study were to explore C. matruchotii\u2019s demography by age and colonization site (plaque and saliva), in vitro bacterial\u2013bacterial interactions in coaggregation and coadhesion assays, and glycolipids as potential binding ligands in thin-layer chromatogram binding assays."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where does C. matruchotii normally exist?","id":"40-1-2-1","answers":[{"text":"the oral cavity, the skin [46], and likely the nose and nasopharynx","answer_start":5644,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"The present study surveyed the presence of C. matruchotii in saliva and tooth biofilm from birth to young adulthood and explored phenotypical characteristics of C. matruchotii related to its presence in saliva and establishment in tooth biofilms. The main findings are that the species establishes after 3 months of age and then reaches nearly 100% by early adulthood. C. matruchotii is enriched in tooth biofilms compared to saliva but does not bind directly to the tooth saliva pellicle and may need an adjuvant component to establish itself. C. matruchotii recognition of lactotriaosylceramide, lactotetraosylceramide, and neolactotetraosylceramide may mediate binding to human tissues. Our findings also support that C. matruchotii is part of the core tooth microbiota in humans. Due to the relatively late colonization, establishment may be associated with tooth eruption, but it is not evidently associated with the number of teeth in early adulthood. Saliva binding in the planktonic phase, but with a limited ability to bind saliva-coated tooth surfaces, suggests binding to a non-tooth absorbing protein or glycoprotein within the saliva, or hidden epitopes after absorption to the tooth surface and that the oral biofilm establishment may build on partner bacteria-dependent recruitment. This would be in line with the prerequisite of tooth eruption and formation of a tooth biofilm before C. matruchotii establishment. Theoretically, binding may also be mediated by a structurally modified tooth pellicle component, but this was not tested in the present study. C. matruchotii has been indicated to be in close proximity with Actinomyces spp. at the tooth surface [3]. In vivo, A. naeslundii was associated with the abundance of C. matruchotii at all ages and, in vitro, A. naeslundii bound C. matruchotii in both planktonic and overlay assays and possessed the ability to recruit C. matruchotii to the tooth surface. We can hypothesize that A. naeslundii, which is an initial tooth colonizer [34], binds to the saliva pellicle [35] and forms a layer that provides C. matruchotii attachment sites. In addition to A. naeslundii, C. matruchotii associated with F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, Leptotrichia sp. HMT 392, and Tannerella sp. HMT 286 in in vivo and in vitro binding assays suggests that Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, Aggregatibacter, and Streptococcus may directly interact with C. matruchotii. To some extent, this is in line with in vivo localization in which the neighbors along the C. matruchotii filament consisted of Fusobacterium, Leptotrichia, and Capnocytophaga, and at its distal end Streptococcus and Porphyromonas, with frequently observed Haemophilus-Aggregatibacter and Neisseriaceae [3]. Notably, Capnocytophaga spp. were associated with the in vivo abundance of C. matruchotii at all ages but did not directly bind to C. matruchotii. The binding properties of C. matruchotii suggest both protein and carbohydrate interactions with its bacterial partners. Similar dual mechanisms have been observed for A. naeslundii [36], but further studies are required to dissect the C. matruchotii bacterial interaction network. Glycolipid binding assays demonstrated selective binding of C. matruchotii to isoglobotriaosylceramide, Gal\u03b13-isoglobotriaosylceramide, lactotriaosylceramide, lactotetraosylceramide, and neolactotetraosylceramide. Isoglobotriaosylceramide is not likely to be a physiologically relevant ligand for C. matruchotii in humans because this glycolipid has not been found in human tissues [37]. Gal\u03b13-isoglobotriaosylceramide has been characterized in cat intestine [38], but not yet in humans. C. matruchotii ligands in humans are most likely lactotriaosylceramide, lactotetraosylceramide, and neolactotetraosylceramide. Lactotetraosylceramide has been identified in the human gastrointestinal tract [39,40,41], whereas neolactotetraosylceramide is widely distributed in human tissues and has been characterized in erythrocytes [42], neutrophils [33], brain [43], and stomach [40]. Lactotriaosylceramide is the precursor of both lactotetraosylceramide and neolactotetraosylceramide and should also be present in these tissues. Furthermore, the terminal Gal\u03b24GlcNAc\u03b2 sequence of neolactotetraosylceramide is a common core structure in the carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins [44]. The current study has some strengths and limitations that should be recognized and considered when evaluating the results. The strengths include a combination of in vivo clinical data and in vitro experimental data to support the conclusions and the wide age range from earliest infancy to early adulthood. In addition, two different C. matruchotii strains were used to cover some within-species genetic variations. The two strains mainly presented overlapping results, but also some phenotypic variation. In addition, for the majority of tested C. matruchotii bacterial binding partners, a limited number of strains within in each species were evaluated, limiting the coverage of intra-species variations. The limitations include a relatively low number of participants with milk and feces samples; however, as the results were consistent among the samples analyzed, these samples rendered conclusive results on the low detection prevalence and abundance. In addition, the use of next generation sequences (NGS) for the identification of microorganisms is potentially associated with errors at various steps, including PCR amplification, sequencing, and bioinformatics. Furthermore, NGS identification includes dead bacteria, and, finally, self-reported information is prone to bias [45]. C. matruchotii colonizes the oral cavity, the skin [46], and likely the nose and nasopharynx, but is not detected in the gastrointestinal tract or human milk, but the association between C. matruchotii and health is still unclear. Interestingly, abundance of the Corynebacterium genus was negatively associated with head and neck squamous cell cancer risk, which also parallels less smoking [47]. We also found smoking to be associated with reduced levels of C. matruchotii, which also coincides with some previous studies [12,15], but not others [17,48]. Notably, C. matruchotii has been suggested to be a low immunogenic species compared to other oral bacteria [49], and the finding that C. matruchotii possesses the ability to bind glycolipids isolated from tissues is of interest for future studies. Genetic tools are required to further understand C. matruchotii [12,50]. Such tools were valuable when the C. matruchotii MdbA gene was characterized, indicating that C. matruchotii possesses the ability to catalyze disulfide bond formation in vitro, and has a similar function as the Corynebacterium diphtheriae MdbA gene, which is required to maintain normal cell growth and morphology, toxin production, and pilus assembly [12]. In conclusion, the present study shows that C. matruchotii establishes after 3 months of age and has reached nearly 100% at early adulthood. C. matruchotii oral biofilm establishment is likely to require both tooth eruption and formation of a pre-existing bacterial biofilm, potentially by A. naeslundii. In addition, C. matruchotii has the ability to interact with glycolipids present on human cells and exhibits specific binding to lactotriaosylceramide, lactotetraosylceramide, neolactotetraosylceramide, isoglobotriaosylceramide, and Gal\u03b13-isoglobotriaosylceramide."}]},{"title":"Corynebacterium matruchotii: A Confirmed Calcifying Bacterium With a Potentially Important Role in the Supragingival Plaque","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Corynebacterium matruchotii normally exist?","id":"40-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"dental calculus","answer_start":98,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Corynebacterium matruchotii is a reported calcifying bacterium that can usually be isolated from dental calculus and induce mineralization in vitro.

The phylogenetic and molecular taxonomic description was based on two isolates from human clinical specimens, one from an unknown source and one from blood cultures of a patient with bronchitis. C. aurimucosum is a non-lipophilic species, and growth is facultatively anaerobic. On Columbia blood agar colonies are generally slightly yellow in colour [1]. The isolation of C. aurimucosum from other human clinical sources has been reported, although very rarely. C. aurimucosum was detected in samples from patients with acute or chronic joint or bone infections [3,4], in infected diabetic foot wounds [5] and in a biopsy sample from a patient with rheumatoid arthritis [6]. Furthermore, C. aurimucosum 16S rDNA was detected in a bacterial population collected in the entrance area of a clean room environment in the Johnson Space Center [7,8] and in dust samples taken from office rooms in buildings located in central Finland [9]. Moreover, unusual charcoal-black-pigmented variants of C. aurimucosum were isolated in the U.S.A. and Canada from female urogenital sources, mostly from vaginal and cervical swabs [10-12]. In 2001, Shukla and co-workers reported the characterization of strain CN-1 (ATCC 700975) that was isolated from a vaginal swab of a 34-year-old female who experienced a spontaneous abortion during month six of pregnancy [10]. Subsequently, additional isolates with similar phenotypic and genotypic characteristics were recovered from the genital tract of women who had complications during pregnancy [12,13], suggesting that this newly recognized corynebacterium might be an opportunistic pathogen in pregnant women [13]. According to their black pigmentation, the name Corynebacterium nigricans was proposed for these isolates, and CN-1 was selected as type strain of this species [14]. However, morphological and biochemical analyses and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes in a polyphasic study of black-pigmented coryneform bacteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) group FCG4 suggested that C. nigricans is a later synonym for C. aurimucosum [12]. In this study, we present the complete genome sequence and bioinformatics analysis of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 (C. nigricans CN-1) to obtain insights into the physiology and lifestyle of this potential urogenital pathogen. Strain CN-1 was originally isolated from a female who presented with the sudden onset of premature labor during month six of gestation. The medical history of the patient was unremarkable, but the fetus died during vaginal delivery. A vaginal sample was taken at the time of delivery and revealed moderate growth of a black-pigmented corynebacterium in conjunction with other normal vaginal flora [10]."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where does C. aurimucosum normally exist?","id":"41-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"human skin","answer_start":4211,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"The annotation and bioinformatics analysis of the complete genome sequence of the clinical isolate C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 (C. nigricans CN-1) provides detailed insights into the metabolism and lifestyle of this bacterium. The most prominent features of C. aurimucosum strains from female urogenital sources are the unusual black pigmentation and their association with complications during pregnancy [12,13]. Due to the black pigmentation and other phenotypic characteristics, these bacteria were initially named C. nigricans [14], but were later shown to represent black-pigmented variants of C. aurimucosum [12]. Annotation of the gene content of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 revealed a cluster of coding regions on plasmid pET44827 that is probably involved in the synthesis of the black pigment. The protein encoded by orf18 showed similarity to the gene product of indC from the phytopathogenic bacterium E. chrysanthemi [71]. The indC gene of E. chrysanthemi codes for a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase that carries out the stepwise synthesis of the blue pigment indigoidine. Reverchon et al. demonstrated that the production of indigoidine conferred an increased resistance to oxidative stress and enhanced the tolerance of E. chrysanthemi cells to external hydrogen peroxide [71]. The protection of the bacterial cells by indigoidine is probably based on common chemical properties of many pigment molecules that comprise several carbonate double bonds and can therefore act as efficient radical scavengers [71,77]. This protective function of a bacterial pigment might be relevant also for C. aurimucosum when colonizing the human vaginal tract. The healthy human vaginal microflora is mostly dominated by acidophilic lactobacilli that play important roles in preventing disease, such as bacterial vaginosis, by creating a low-pH environment with a product of their metabolism, lactic acid, and by producing hydrogen peroxide [54]. The synthesis of hydrogen peroxide by lactobacilli provides a major protection mechanism against opportunistic pathogens in the female genital tract [78]. Hydrogen peroxide is toxic in two ways, firstly by producing toxic hydroxyl radicals and secondly by combining with the pool of chlorine ions in the vagina to generate chloridium ions [79]. Hence, the colonization of the female genital tract by C. aurimucosum may depend on the efficient protection against cellular damage induced by external hydrogen peroxide. Although the genome of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 contains a standard gene repertoire for defense against oxidative stress (including catalase, superoxide dismutase and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase), efficient protection of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 cells against reactive oxygen species in the human vagina is additionally achieved by the synthesis of the typical black pigment that might act as radical scavenger. The location of the corresponding genes on plasmid pET44827 explains why black-pigmented and non-pigmented C. aurimucosum strains were isolated from clinical specimens. Remarkably, only black-pigmented strains were recovered from female genital sources, pointing towards the pivotal role of pigmentation for the colonization of the vaginal tract. However, when considering complications during pregnancy, such as bleeding, lactobacilli are less efficient in producing hydrogen peroxide, causing increased alkaline conditions in the vagina and thereby permitting the overgrowth of pathogenic microbes [80]. It would be interesting to screen non-pregnant women and sexually active men to see if some of them are colonized with this bacterium. Although Corynebacterium species appeared to be present in the healthy human vaginal microflora [78,81-83] and on the vaginal epithelium [84], C. aurimucosum was hitherto not detected in specimens from the genital tract of healthy women. Which pathway of vaginal, cervical and intrauterine infection by C. aurimucosum is therefore likely? Information regarding the non-urogenital habitat of C. aurimucosum is currently based on only three reports: (i) Three 16S rDNA sequences were detected in specimens from the forearm skin of a healthy male, indicating that C. aurimucosum is part of the human skin biota [19]. (ii) A single 16S rDNA sequence was reported in the prostate fluid from a prostatitis patient [85]. (iii) An apparently pigmented C. aurimucosum strain, originally named C. nigricans AE1-3, was recovered from a fecal sample of a 35-year-old male Japanese volunteer [37]. This isolation of C. aurimucosum from a fecal sample suggested that this species (and its pigmented variants) may reside in the human intestine. The specific metabolic features of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 deduced from the annotation of detected singletons corroborate this microbiological observation. C. aurimucosum may therefore gain access to the lower genital tract by contamination, followed by the so-called ascending pathway from the vagina and cervix, which is the most common route of intrauterine infections [80]. However, almost all of the black-pigmented variants of C. aurimucosum have been reported from urogenital sources suggesting that it may be the primary niche for this potential pathogen. Indeed, its capability to (i) attach to mucosal surfaces through pili, (ii) make biofilms, and (iii) utilize aromatic compounds and L-histidine suggests that it is fully equipped to invade vaginal mucosa. When viewed in the context of its consistent isolation from pregnant women during complications of pregnancy, it is reasonable to assume that it plays an important role there. In the gut ecosystem, aromatic amines and aromatic acids can be a frequent carbon and energy source for microbial growth when oxygen is available for the enzymatic ring cleavage reaction [39]. As oxygen molecules are present in close proximity to epithelial cells, where they pass from the blood through the epithelium, bacterial cells attached to the epithelium can assimilate such molecules and can thus benefit from the presence of oxygen [40]. The adherence of C. aurimucosum to epithelial cells is apparently mediated by a pilus structure of the SpaH type, consisting of the major pilin SpaH and the minor pilins SpaI and SpaG. Adherence of C. diphtheriae to pharyngeal epithelial cells can be mediated also by the minor pilin SpaB of the structurally related SpaABC pilus [57]. The SpaB protein is covalently anchored to the cell wall to provide tight contact between the bacterial cell and the host tissue in the absence of a pilus shaft. Taking into consideration a similar functioning of the SpaI subunit of the SpaH pilus, adherence of C. aurimucosum cells to host tissue may also occur in the absence of a pilus shaft. Adhesive pili can mediate the initial contact to host cell receptors, with cell-wall-linked pilins supporting the formation of an intimate zone of adhesion. This close contact between the bacterium and host cells enables additional ligand-receptor interactions and, in the case of pathogenic interactions, the efficient delivery of virulence factors [58]. Furthermore, the adherence of C. aurimucosum to epithelial cells may result in the formation of biofilms. The cross-linking of bacterial cells can be mediated by the G5 domains of the accumulation-associated protein Aap that is encoded on the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 chromosome and can probably interact with N-acetylglycosamine residues present in the peptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall [59]."}]}]},{"species":"Corynebacterium striatum","docs":[{"title":"Corynebacterium striatum: a diphtheroid with pathogenic potential","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Corynebacterium striatum cause?","id":"42-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"pleuropulmonary infections and bacteremia","answer_start":248,"id":1},{"text":"infection of exist sites of central venous catheters, thrombophlebitis associated with central venous catheters, conjunctivitis, and chorioamnionitis","answer_start":510,"id":2},{"text":"peritonitis and pyogenic granuloma","answer_start":707,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are C. striatum sensitive to?","id":"42-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"vancomycin and aminoglycosides","answer_start":957,"id":1},{"text":"penicillin G, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin","answer_start":1036,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Although nondiphtherial corynebacteria are ubiquitous in nature and commonly colonize the skin and mucous membranes of humans, they rarely account for clinical infection.

Unlike Corynebacterium jeikeium, which is highly resistant to beta-lactam agents, aminoglycosides, and quinolones, all strains of C. striatum isolated from the patients described in this report were susceptible to vancomycin and aminoglycosides, and all strains except one were susceptible to penicillin G, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. C. striatum should be recognized as a potential pathogen in both immunocompromised and normal hosts in the appropriate circumstances, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy can quickly lead to resolution of infection.

METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of the C. striatum isolated in a university hospital from January 1991 to July 1995. C. striatum was identified using conventional methods, the API CORYNE system and cellular fatty acid profiles. RESULTS: In the study period, C. striatum was isolated from clinical samples in 127 patients. In 49 patients, data from clinical charts were considered insufficient for evaluation. In 26 cases, the microorganism was considered to be the etiologic agent of an infectious process. In the remaining 52 patients, the organism was considered to be a colonizer. Before the infection all the patients had been hospitalized for some underlying condition, and 22 (85%) of them had received antibiotics previously. Six patients died. In two of them, death was a consequence of their underlying disease and in the remaining four, death was related to the C. striatum infection. CONCLUSIONS: C. striatum, a microorganism traditionally considered to be an avirulent member of the normal human nasopharyngeal and skin flora, may opportunistically cause infections in hospitalized patients with underlying diseases and previous antibiotic treatments.

He had a history of having fallen when lifting furniture 3 months previously and had been treated with simple analgesics. Due to increasing pain, his general practitioner organized a pelvic X-ray 4 days prior to his hospital presentation. This showed a fracture involving the left pubic ramus. Since his pain was not controlled, he was referred to hospital for further management. He denied any fever or night sweats, and there had been no significant weight loss. He had a recent excision of basal cell carcinoma in the left preauricular region approximately a month previously and had had a partial left knee joint replacement in the past. Clinical examination was unremarkable, apart from tenderness around the pubic symphysis. His inflammatory markers were raised with C-reactive protein (CRP) of 288 mg\/liter (normal value of <5) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 23 mm\/h (normal value of <20). His white cell count and differentials were normal. A magnetic resonant imaging (MRI) scan showed insufficiency fractures of the left symphysis pubis and right sacral alar, with probable osteomyelitis of the left symphysis pubis, myositis, and a soft tissue collection within the left adductor brevis muscle measuring approximately 40 by 19 by 18 mm. An aspirate of this collection was performed under ultrasound guidance and was sent for cytology and microbiological analysis. He was given the provisional diagnosis of osteomyelitis and was started on empirical intravenous flucloxacillin. The cytology report showed numerous neutrophils, some macrophages, and nonspecific birefringent particles, but no malignant cells. He was discharged on the 10th day of admission on home intravenous treatment with cephazolin for 4 weeks. This was followed by 4 weeks of oral amoxicillin. He showed clinical improvement, with CRP and ESR declining to 6 and 9, respectively, over a period of 3 weeks. Gram staining of the aspirate from the adductor brevis collection revealed numerous leukocytes with occasional Gram-positive coccobacilli seen both intracellularly and extracellularly. The aspirate was received in a sterile, screw-top bottle and was plated onto Columbia sheep blood agar, chocolate agar, MacConkey agar, and blood neomycin agar and incubated aerobically and anaerobically. After 48 h of incubation, small, nonhemolytic, gray-white pinpoint colonies were seen on the sheep blood agar. The isolate was recovered in pure culture. The colonies were slow growing, but their growth was enhanced by Tween 80 on repeat culture. One drop of Tween 80 was instilled onto a lawn of C. accolens on sheep blood agar. After overnight incubation, colonies covered by Tween 80 showed significantly enhanced growth compared to areas without it. On subculture, visible colonies could be seen after 24 h. The API CORYNE (version 3.0), with an API code of 1100315 (as interpreted according to API Web; bioM\u00e9rieux), identified the isolate as Corynebacterium macginleyi. 16S rRNA sequencing (1,445 bp) and partial rpoB sequencing (394 bp) identified the isolate as Corynebacterium accolens. The primers used for the amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA partial gene were as described by Wilbrink et al. (15), and aligned with the 16S rRNA sequence database at http:\/\/blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Blast.cgi. The partial rpoB gene was amplified and sequenced using primers C2700F and C3130R (9) and analyzed by web-based alignment at http:\/\/umr5558-sud-str1.univ-lyon1.fr\/lebibi\/lebibi.cgi.

A repeat API CORYNE analysis gave a profile of 1000315 and 95.6% identification for C. accolens. The key reactions were positive nitrate reduction, d-glucose, d-ribose, mannitol, and sucrose fermentation and a negative alkaline phosphatase reaction. Two sets of blood cultures were taken prior to starting antibiotics and were incubated with BacT\/Alert 3D (bioM\u00e9rieux). These showed no growth after 5 days. The initial susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion. An inoculum with a 0.5 McFarland standard was prepared and swabbed in three different directions on Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. The isolate was susceptible to penicillin (10 U), erythromycin (15 \u03bcg), vancomycin (30 \u03bcg), ciprofloxacin (5 \u03bcg), ceftriaxone (30 \u03bcg), and tetracycline (30 \u03bcg), using Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) interpretive criteria set for Staphylococcus spp. (5, 7). An Etest was initially performed on Mueller-Hinton agar with 5% sheep blood and showed a penicillin MIC of 0.06 \u03bcg\/ml. Broth microdilution was performed subsequently by our reference laboratory according to the CLSI method (5) and showed a penicillin MIC of 0.12 mg\/liter, vancomycin MIC of 0.5 mg\/liter, erythromycin MIC of 0.016 mg\/liter, and gentamicin MIC of 0.06 mg\/liter. These are all within susceptible ranges. Corynebacterium accolens (previously CDC Corynebacterium group G-1) was first described by Neubauer et al. in 1991 (7, 11). It is a Gram-positive bacillus considered to be an inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract. It has been isolated from human clinical specimens from sites including wound drainage, endocervix, sputum, throat swab, breast abscess, and valvular vegetations (1, 4, 7, 8, 11). It has also been isolated from cases of sepsis, otitis media, keratoconjunctivitis, sinusitis maxillaris, and meningitis (4, 11). C. accolens forms small, gray, transparent, nonhemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. Its growth is enhanced by lipids such as Tween 80, and it also shows satellitism along a Staphylococcus streak. It ferments glucose and variably ferments sucrose and mannitol. It reduces nitrate and does not utilize esculin or produce urease. Among the corynebacteria, it is biochemically closely related to C. macginleyi, except that it is negative for alkaline phosphatase. It is included in the database of API CORYNE and RapID CB Plus systems (8). In our case, our isolate was initially misidentified as C. macginleyi by API CORYNE, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing failed to resolve identification (hence, the use of rpoB as a secondary target was required). As C. macginleyi has been exclusively isolated from eye specimens, the identification was doubted, and the isolate was forwarded for sequencing. Rigorous efforts to confirm identification are important when these bacteria are isolated from previously unreported sites. To our knowledge, an association of C. accolens with osteomyelitis and myositis has not been previously described. Bone and joint infections caused by Corynebacterium species have been described with C. aurimucosum, C. amycolatum (14), C. striatum (6), C. jeikeium (2, 12), C. urealyticum (3), and C. diphtheriae (13). Ang and Brown described C. accolens isolated from a breast abscess sample following mild trauma (1). Our case also had a history of trauma secondary to a fall 3 months prior to the patient's hospital presentation. This man disclosed a history of excision of a skin cancer in the left preauricular region about a week prior to onset of his hip pain. It is possible that this could be a portal of entry of the infection. It is unclear if C. accolens may also colonize other mucosal sites. The MIC breakpoints for our isolate obtained by the broth microdilution method are within the susceptible range for penicillin, and this is consistent with the other reports in which patients clinically responded to amoxicillin (1, 4). MICs obtained with Etest had been reported to be as reliable as those obtained with broth microdilution and disk diffusion in susceptibility testing of coryneform bacteria (10). Corynebacterium is a common skin commensal (7). However, when repeatedly isolated, or isolated from a sterile site, or in pure culture, it is very likely to be clinically significant. C. accolens was the sole organism isolated from this man. It was seen on the initial Gram stain and subsequently isolated in pure culture from his left adductor brevis collection situated in close proximity to the left symphysis pubis. In our case, despite the bacteria being seen on a Gram stain, it took over 24 h for the initial isolate to grow. This is consistent with other reports (1, 4) that C. accolens is a slow-growing bacterium species. The patient in our case was also given empirical flucloxacillin upon admission, which may have slowed the rate of recovery. Despite having a knee prosthesis in situ on the same side as the osteomyelitis of the pubic rami, there is no clinical evidence of disease involving this site. It is probable that for some unknown reasons, C. accolens may favor previously traumatized sites. Infection of prosthetic material with C. accolens has not yet been reported. In conclusion, our case represents the first reported case of osteomyelitis associated with C. accolens. The risk factors for this remain unclear, but the patient in our case developed osteomyelitis of the left pubic symphysis and soft tissue collection in the adjacent adductor brevis muscle following trauma and fracture of the pubic symphysis."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Corynebacterium accolens is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"43-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-positive","answer_start":5998,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Corynebacterium accolens normally exist?","id":"43-1-3-2","answers":[{"text":"upper respiratory tract","answer_start":6059,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can C. accolens cause?","id":"43-1-3-3","answers":[{"text":"osteomyelitis","answer_start":9783,"id":1},{"text":"sepsis, otitis media, keratoconjunctivitis, sinusitis maxillaris, and meningitis","answer_start":6304,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Corynebacterium accolens?","id":"43-1-3-4","answers":[{"text":"bacillus","answer_start":6012,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"A previously healthy 69-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with a 3-week history of an increasingly painful left hip.

The lipophilic C. jeikeium is also related phylogenetically. The results of our DNA-DNA hybridization studies with type strains of C. auriscanis and C. jeikeium revealed that the unknown coryneform is not related specifically to any other species. Comparison of the biochemical characteristics of lipophilic Corynebacterium with those of our isolates (Table \u200b(Table3)3) shows that only C. afermentans subsp. lipophilum and C. urealyticum are unable to oxidize glucose, maltose, sucrose, mannitol, or xylose. C. urealyticum and C. afermentans subsp. lipophilum can be differentiated from our isolates because they are urease and pyrazimidase positive, respectively. Biochemical characteristics of lipophilic Corynebacterium spp. With the API Coryne system a profile code of 4100004 is considered a doubtful profile, which makes our isolates readily recognizable in clinical laboratories. Our newly identified corynebacterium is similar to C. jeikeium and C. urealyticum in that it is resistant to a number of antimicrobial agents, which makes this strain clinically relevant. C. jeikeium and C. urealyticum are susceptible to teicoplanin and vancomycin as well as to the tetracyclines (16), whereas our isolates are resistant to tetracyclines. Among corynebacteria, our isolates appear to have the greatest degree of resistance to antimicrobial therapies, which complicates patient management. While vancomycin is considered the first choice for eradication of multidrug-resistant corynebacteria, the use of vancomycin is restricted to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Japan because of potential nephrotoxicity and to prevent its overuse. Therefore, minocycline is considered the first choice, both for safety and for economic considerations. In the present study, GTC 2027 was isolated on three occasions over 2 days during an episode of sepsis from a 68-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome. On the basis of the clinical findings and the recovery of corynebacteria from blood cultures, we considered C. jeikeium the most likely etiologic agent, and minocycline (200 mg\/day) was administered. Because the MIC of 8 \u03bcg\/ml was considered high, we believe that lack of effective therapy contributed to the subsequent death of the patient from sepsis. Our isolates present a clinical challenge because glycopeptides appear to be the only antimicrobial agents with low MICs. Of the five strains in the present study, only GTC 2025, which was recovered from a patient in an outpatient setting, showed low MICs for imipenem and minocycline. It is thought that exposure to antimicrobial agents in an inpatient setting contributes to increased resistance. Furthermore, as with C. jeikeium, the potential for nosocomial spread increases the clinical significance of our isolates (8, 15). On the basis of our phenotypic and molecular genetic findings, we propose that the unknown multidrug-resistant corynebacteria described above be classified as a new species within the genus Corynebacterium and that the name Corynebacterium resistens sp. nov. be used.  Corynebacterium resistens (L. adj. resistens, resistant). The descriptive characteristics given below are based on the results of the studies of the five strains. Cells are gram positive, non-spore-forming, and nonmotile. They are typically club-shaped rods, coryneform bacteria (indicative of true Corynebacterium spp.) 1 to 3 \u03bcm in length, and arranged as single cells, in pairs, or in small clusters. Growth on TSA with 5% sheep blood demonstrated nonpigmented, grayish-white, glistening, pearly colonies up to 1.0 mm in diameter. Colonies were catalase positive, oxidase negative, nonhemolytic, and very slow growing under anaerobic conditions. Tween 80 enhanced growth, resulting in colonies 2 to 4 mm in diameter; CAMP negative, lipophilic, and nitrate was not reduced. There was no oxidizing resolution of any carbohydrates. However, the fermenting resolution was as follows: d-tagatose, 5-ketogluconate, ribose, and d-glucose were positive. For four of the five strains, trehalose and l-sorbose were positive. All strains were negative for glycerol, erythritol, d-arabinose, l-arabinose, d-xylose, l-xylose, adonitol, \u03b2-methylxyloside, galactose, d-fructose, d-mannose, rhamnose, dulcitol, inositol, mannitol, sorbitol, \u03b1-methyl-d-mannoside, \u03b1-methyl-d-glucoside, N-acetylglucosamine, amygdaline, arbutin, esculin, salicin, cellobiose, maltose, lactose, melibiose, sucrose, inulin, melezitose, d-raffinose, starch, glycogen, xylitol, \u03b2-gentiobiose, d-turanose, d-lyxose, d-fucose, l-fucose, d-arabitol, l-arabitol, gluconate, and 2-ketogluconate. Alkaline phosphatase, esterase (C4), esterase lipase (C8), leucine arylamidase, acid phosphatase, and naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase were clearly positive, whereas lipase (C14), cysteine, and arylamidase were weakly positive.

MVR: Mitral Valve Replacement. TI: Tricuspid Insufficiency. The first case was a 77-year-old female who presented with oliguria, fatigue, and generalized weakness. She had two episodes of a urinary tract infection (UTI) in the last two months. She also had aortic valve (AV) and mitral valve (MV) replacement six months earlier due to aortic stenosis (AS) and mitral insufficiency (MI). Diagnosis of mitral valve infective endocarditis (IE) due to C. jeikeium was confirmed with a blood culture. She was treated by mitral valve replacement (MVR) and vancomycin for six weeks. The patient was discharged completely cured [1]. The second patient was a 51-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital due to a long history of fever, fatigue, weight loss, and dental caries. Patient had past medical history of mitral insufficiency. Blood culture showed growth of C. jeikeium. The patient was diagnosed with IE and underwent multiple teeth extractions. He was further treated with vancomycin and gentamycin for a total of six weeks. He was readmitted four months later with another episode of endocarditis and was retreated with the same antimicrobials for another six weeks. The patient recovered and discharged after two months [1]. The third case was a 54-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital after experiencing fever and chills for one day. He was on hemodialysis due to ESRD and also suffered from mitral insufficiency. Echocardiography showed MV vegetation and blood culture confirmed growth of C. jeikeium. Patient was treated with vancomycin for ten weeks and recovered uneventfully [1]. The fourth patient was a 57-year-old woman who underwent MV and AV replacement (MVR and AVR), tricuspid valve annuloplasty, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to calcified MS, functional tricuspid insufficiency, and stenotic lesions of the coronary arteries. She developed septicemia after surgery and mitral insufficiency was noticed. Blood cultures confirmed diphtheroid group JK growth. Combined antimicrobials, including parenteral erythromycin, piperacillin, and netilmicin, were started, but the patient deteriorated and mitral valve vegetation remained unchanged. The patient also developed positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus epidermidis and died after three months due to cardiogenic shock [1]. Case number five was a 45-year-old man who underwent AVR due to severe aortic insufficiency (AI) following mixed AS and AI with signs of left ventricular dilatation. The patient developed fever and chills. Blood cultures showed JK diphtheroid growth. An echocardiography revealed severe AI due to paravalvular leakage. He was started on vancomycin and his prosthetic valve was replaced. He recovered after receiving vancomycin for a total of 30 days [1]. The sixth patient was a 56-year-old alcoholic woman who underwent liver transplantation due to fulminant hepatic failure. She also suffered from hepatorenal syndrome which required hemodialysis. The post-transplant course was complicated with respiratory insufficiency, renal failure, and sepsis. Different cultures from central line and indwelling dialysis catheter showed growth for C. jeikeium and the patient was treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime for four weeks. She recovered, but one month later, was re-admitted due to decreased urine output and orthopnea. Echocardiogram showed new incidence of AV vegetation and severe AI. Aortic valve replacement surgery was performed and the patient was treated with vancomycin and amphotericin for two weeks. She recovered and was discharged in good condition [2]. The seventh case was a 63-year-old woman with a history of CABG. She presented with fever, progressive malaise, fatigue, and generalized weakness six weeks after she underwent two coronary catheterizations with angioplasty and stent placement both performed through a right femoral access with a one week interval. The initial evaluation did not show any evidence of infective endocarditis. So a third cardiac catheterization was performed that showed AV vegetation with severe AI. She was treated with intravenous vancomycin and gentamicin and underwent emergent AVR with a bioprosthesis. Her post surgical course was complicated with multi-organ dysfunction and the patient\u2019s family requested withdrawal of support, thus, the patient expired [3]. Case number eight was an 84-year-old man who presented with a low grade fever, left sided body weakness, and fatigue for ten days before admission. His past medical history was positive for bioprosthetic AVR due to severe aortic calcification. An EKG showed first degree AV block. TEE confirmed vegetation on the prosthetic aortic valve. Blood culture grew C. jeikeium on three cultures. His bioprosthetic AV was replaced and vancomycin, gentamycin, and rifampicin were given for a total of six weeks. The patient recovered and was discharged in good health [4]. The ninth case was a 72-year-old man who was admitted after six weeks of fever. He had a dual chamber pacemaker due to brady-tachy syndrome with bifasicular block. The TEE was unremarkable and one out of twelve sets of blood cultures showed growth of C. jeikeium. The patient received vancomycin and linezolid for two weeks followed by doxycycline for six weeks. Three weeks after discontinuation of antimicrobials, the patient was readmitted with recurrent fever and a positive blood culture. He was then treated with vancomycin for two weeks followed by doxycycline and rifampicin for four weeks. The pacemaker was replaced as well. He recovered in good condition [5]. The last case was a 57-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital due to third degree AV block; a temporary pacemaker was immediately inserted. The patient had previously undergone AVR. TTE revealed large vegetation on the prosthetic aortic valve. He was started on daptomycin, rifampicin, and ceftazidime after the blood culture was sent. The results showed C. jeikeium growth. The antimicrobials continued for six weeks. The aortic valve was replaced and the patient recovered [6]. Diphtheroids are gram-positive pleomorphic bacilli in the family of Coryneform bacteria. These organisms are present in the human flora and generally regarded as nonpathogenic contaminants of different samples including blood cultures due to low virulence, but they may cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients [[7], [8]]. During the last four decades, there have been an increasing number of scientific publications related to the clinical microbiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogenic corynebacteria and other gram positive rods. A few different features have contributed to this development: 1) as a result of advances in medical science, there is an increased number of patients with immunosuppressive disease or risk factors for opportunistic and nosocomial infection, 2) organisms whose pathogenic potential was initially underestimated, like nondiphtherial corynebacteria, are now recognized with increasing frequency as opportunistic human pathogens [9], and 3) improvement in microbiologic and genetic techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) made it possible to differentiate between several species of these organisms."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Corynebacterium jeikeium is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"46-1-4-1","answers":[{"text":"gram positive","answer_start":49,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can C. jeikeium cause?","id":"46-1-4-2","answers":[{"text":"endocarditis","answer_start":413,"id":1},{"text":"endocarditis","answer_start":574,"id":2},{"text":"endocarditis","answer_start":771,"id":3},{"text":"endocarditis","answer_start":1449,"id":4},{"text":"different forms of infectious disease including endocarditis","answer_start":276,"id":5}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are C. jeikeium sensitive to?","id":"46-1-4-3","answers":[{"text":"vancomycin","answer_start":1388,"id":1},{"text":"vancomycin or teicoplanin","answer_start":1525,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Corynebacterium jeikeium?","id":"46-1-4-4","answers":[{"text":"rods","answer_start":63,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Nondiphtherial Corynebacteria (diphtheroids) are gram positive rods which are increasingly recognized as pathogenic organisms causing different human infections. C. jeikeium is the most well-known pathogen of this group in hospital and intensive care settings which can cause different forms of infectious disease including endocarditis. There are many different factors that can increase the risk of C. jeikeium endocarditis in various patients. According to our article review summarized in Table 1, five out of ten patients (50%) had valve replacement prior to infective endocarditis due to C. jeikeium. All these five patients (100%), suffered infective endocarditis on the same prosthetic valve. This is consistent with the study that showed majority of C. jeikeium endocarditis occurs in patients with prosthetic valves [7]. Similar to our patient, two out of ten patients (20%) had a history of renal insufficiency on hemodialysis and had an indwelling catheter. This can be correlated with the study that showed increased frequency of C. jeikeium infection in patients who are immunocompromised or have in-place catheter insertion [32]. Like our patient, all ten cases, except case numbers 4 and 10, were treated with vancomycin alone or as a combined therapy (see Table 1). Seven out of eight patients who were treated with vancomycin recovered, which supports the importance of vancomycin treatment in patients who suffer from C. jeikeium endocarditis.

Broad-spectrum resistance to antimicrobial agents is a common feature of C. jeikeium clinical isolates.

The strains were separated into two groups depending on the susceptibility to erythromycin (ERY), with one group (17 strains) representing resistant organisms (MIC > 128 \u03bcg\/ml) and the second group (3 strains) representing susceptible organisms (MIC \u2264 0.25 \u03bcg\/ml).

The highest incidence (up to 82%) of colonization occurs in severely immunocompromised patients. This colonization can lead to infection (sepsis), especially in neutropenic patients and in patients with skin disruption (e.g., by indwelling medical devices). Frequently, infected patients have been on prolonged antibiotic regimens, which often results in disease caused by organisms with broad-spectrum drug resistance, including resistance to macrolides. In these cases, therapeutic options are very limited, essentially relying on vancomycin. C. jeikeium can also cause infections in immunocompetent patients. For example, in a recent study (24), C. jeikeium (and other corynebacteria) was identified as a cause of infections in patients following joint replacement surgery and in patients with open bone fractures. Although C. jeikeium is a significant opportunistic pathogen primarily of the immunocompromised host, the presence of C. jeikeium in the hospital environment is probably the most clinically important aspect of the natural history of this organism. This is because there is recent evidence that drug resistance genes may have transferred from corynebacteria to a Proprionibacterium sp. clinical isolate (A. Eady, presented at the 100th Gen. Meet. Am. Soc. Microbiol., 2000). Thus, the high incidence of multiply drug-resistant C. jeikeium suggests that this organism may be an important environmental reservoir of drug resistance genes. The molecular bases for multidrug resistance in C. jeikeium are incompletely understood but may be a consequence of the accumulation of individual and specific genetic events or may involve nonspecific mechanisms, such as increased drug efflux or changes in the permeability of the cell wall. Macrolide resistance in C. jeikeium is of particular interest because it is clearly an acquired phenotype and is common in clinical isolates. Thus, in this report, we present a study of the basis of macrolide resistance in C. jeikeium as a first step in understanding the molecular and genetic basis for multidrug resistance in this clinically important species."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Corynebacterium jeikeium resistant to?","id":"46-2-3-1","answers":[{"text":"Macrolide","answer_start":84,"id":1},{"text":"Macrolide","answer_start":1489,"id":2},{"text":"Macrolide","answer_start":1592,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"In this report, we describe the genetic elements responsible for the acquisition of macrolide resistance in C. jeikeium, as part of the phenomenon of multidrug resistance observed in this species. Macrolide resistance was found to cross to the other members of the MLSb group, and the acquisition of macrolide resistance was separate from resistance to other non-MLSb agents. These observations suggest that broad-spectrum resistance in C. jeikeium is the result of the accumulation of several independent genetic changes. MLSb resistance in C. jeikeium is conferred by alleles of the erm gene class X. Recently, Roberts et al. (15) proposed a logical nomenclature for erm genes, and grouped the corynebacterial genes in erm class X. Thus, MLSb resistance in C. jeikeium is conferred by alleles of the erm gene class X. However, despite the high degree of homology between the erm(X) alleles isolated from different corynebacteria (i.e., C. diphtheriae, C. jeikeium, and C. xerosis), the alleles were found in different genetic contexts. The C. diphtheriae erm(X) gene (originally termed ermCd) was located within a 14.5-kbp plasmid pNG2 (7), whereas the C. xerosis erm(X) gene (originally termed ermCX) was located within transposon Tn5432, which itself was carried by the 50-kbp R plasmid, pTP10 (22). In contrast, our evidence indicates that erm(X)cj is integrated within the C. jeikeium chromosome. This is consistent with a previous report by Pitcher et al. (13), which suggests that macrolide resistance in C. jeikeium is not plasmid associated. Evidence for chromosomal association of macrolide resistance determinants has also been reported for C. striatum (14). Despite the differences in the carriage of the erm(X) genes of C. jeikeium and C. xerosis, in 40% of MLSb-resistant C. jeikeium strains erm(X) is associated with the transposon Tn5432. In the remaining 60% of MLSb-resistant C. jeikeium strains erm(X) is not associated with Tn5432, although these strains do possess all the component parts of the transposon. Since Tn5432 is highly conserved between C. jeikeium and C. xerosis, we believe that all MLSb-resistant C. jeikeium strains originally acquired erm(X)cj within Tn5432 but subsequently the transposon became rearranged within the chromosome. This phenomenon may indicate the presence of an integron (5). This leads to the possibility that the IS1249 elements have formed new composite transposons containing other drug resistance genes. This point is particularly troubling since the transposase of IS1249 is known to be able to insert Tn5432 (and presumably other IS1249-containing transposons) into the genomes of unrelated bacteria (22). The source organisms from which the corynebacterial erm genes were characterized were isolated from geographically distinct locations. The original pNG2-containing C. diphtheriae and the C. striatum were isolated from patients from the northwestern United States (3, 14), whereas the pTP10-containing C. xerosis was isolated in Japan (22). The C. jeikeium organisms used in this study were isolated from patients in France. This distribution of erm(X) suggests that the corynebacteria acquire the erm gene from a common source, possibly an organism that can be found colonizing skin or mucosa. The fact that the mode of carriage of the erm genes is different suggests that the reservoir is not readily transferred from organism to organism, i.e., the erm gene either is on a plasmid with a narrow host range or is chromosome associated. It is interesting that the ermCd-containing plasmid (pNG2) is similar to plasmids isolated from a range of skin-colonizing corynebacteria (20) and appears to have a broad host range, including E. coli (19, 21). Thus, pNG2 is unlikely to be the environmental reservoir element for all the corynebacterial erm genes. The transposon, Tn5432, is a more likely candidate as it is common to two Corynebacterium species, is integrated within the chromosome of one species, and is known to be mobile (22). Clearly, more studies are needed to characterize the clinical importance of multidrug-resistant corynebacteria, such as C. jeikeium, as reservoirs of resistance genes within the hospital environment."}]}]},{"species":"Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum","docs":[{"title":"Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum causing genitourinary tract infection: Case report and review of the literature","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum cause?","id":"47-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"urethritis","answer_start":397,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum?","id":"47-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogens","answer_start":55,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are C. glucuronolyticum sensitive to?","id":"47-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"ciprofloxacin","answer_start":1030,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Corynebacterium species are increasingly recognized as opportunistic pathogens.

C. glucuronolyticum is a rare species isolated from male patients with genitourinary tract infections, probably being part of the normal male genitourinary microbiota, while its presence in females is uncertain. Uncommonly, C. glucuronolyticum has been also found in blood and peritoneal fluid [5], [9], and, recently, it has been recognized among the most common agents of monomicrobial paucisymptomatic bacterial prostatitis, along with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., and Escherichia coli [10]. Finally, it has been found that C. glucuronolyticum is not associated exclusively with humans, but also with animals [7], [11]. In this report we documented an episode of urethritis caused by C. glucuronolyticum, thus further confirming the pathogenic role of this species in the genitourinary tract infections, mainly in otherwise healthy males, in agreement with the more recently published literature [12], [13]. Although C. glucuronolyticum is reported to be a non-lipophilic microorganism, lipophilic Corynebacterium species have been described to grow poorly in broth or as tiny pinpoint colonies onto standard agar plates after 24 h-incubation [14]. In this case the strain grew as tiny colonies after 24 h-incubation under 5% CO2 atmosphere, being more clearly observed only after 48 h of incubation. Identification of coryneforms to the species level is often problematic [15]. It should be always performed when they grow as pure culture from clinical specimens and when they represent the most abundant organisms in samples collected from physiologically sterile sites. Establishing an association between Corynebacterium species and disease is strictly dependent on a correct identification to the species level [16]. In fact, an accurate species identification of this group of bacteria is worthwhile to ascribe potential pathogenic role to species that were previously thought to be mere innocent bystanders, and to discriminate infective agents from harmless colonizers. Therefore, the methods used for identification have to be appropriate and must reflect taxonomic changes observed among coryneform bacteria. Most coryneform taxa can be identified to the species level mainly through three different identification approaches, (i) phenotypic methods, mostly relying on biochemical tests; (ii) proteomic-based analysis, meaning the use of MALDI-TOF technology; (iii) sequence-based identification methods [17], [18]. It is also necessary to emphasize the importance of Gram staining for the preliminary identification of coryneform bacteria [14]. As regards biochemical tests, the key reactions that are used to differentiate coryneforms are catalase activity, fermentative or oxidative carbohydrate utilization, urea production, esculin hydrolysis, and the CAMP reaction, the latter being obtained by inoculating a studied isolate perpendicularly to a \u03b2-hemolysin-producing Staphylococcus strain [14], [19]. Motility and establishing whether the isolate is lipophilic are also helpful [14]. MALDI-TOF represents a revolutionary technology, that rapidly became a routinely used tool in many microbiology laboratories, whereby specific bacterial proteins are ionized and detected by a mass spectrometer; then the generated spectrum is analyzed, and its pattern compared to entries found in a database, thus giving rise to a score matching species-specific profile. There are limited studies evaluating the use of MALDI-TOF for Corynebacterium spp. identification, although findings are comforting [20], [21], [22]. Molecular genetic techniques for species identification of Corynebacterium strains include 16S rRNA gene and rpoB gene sequencing [14], [17]. In this report, C. glucuronolyticum was correctly and consistently identified to the species level by using both MALDI TOF and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, thus confirming the former as a rapid and valuable system for identification of this species. C. glucuronolyticum isolates have been frequently shown to be tetracycline-resistant and may also exhibit resistance to macrolides and lincosamides [23]. C. glucuronolyticum strains resistant to ciprofloxacin have been recently described [13]. Our strain resulted to be resistant, in vitro, to tetracycline, macrolides, and lincosamides, but susceptible to all other antibiotics tested and, particularly, the fluoroquinolone proven to be effective to treat the infectious process described. Although C. glucuronolyticum is infrequently isolated, we strongly recommend that it should be considered as a potential cause of urogenital infection in male patients, and therefore always included in the etiologic diagnostic algorithm. In particular, the slow growth this species may display on agar media should be taken into account, as emphasized here, to reach a reliable diagnosis."}]},{"title":"Urethritis due to Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum cause?","id":"47-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"urethritis","answer_start":23,"id":1},{"text":"non-gonococcal urethritis","answer_start":167,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum sensitive to?","id":"47-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"fluoroquinolones","answer_start":621,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" We describe a case of urethritis in a young man caused by Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum.

Lipophilic corynebacteria are a particularly relevant subgroup of corynebacteria since they might be involved in infections of hospitalized patients and often show multiresistance to antimicrobials (9). The taxonomic characterization of C. tuberculostearicum is intricate and is described here briefly. In 1984, Brown et al. studied 16 so-called leprosy-derived coryneform (LDC) strains and named the isolates \u201cC. tuberculostearicum\u201d because their fatty acid profile comprised tuberculostearic acid (3). Riegel et al. then showed that \u201cC. tuberculostearicum\u201d strain LDC8, as well as three strains of \u201cC. pseudogenitalium,\u201d another not validly named lipophilic Corynebacterium species, and the reference strain of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) coryneform group G-2 (CDC G5840) clustered within one group (genomospecies I) based on DNA-DNA-hybridization analysis (15). In 2004, the species C. tuberculostearicum was characterized validly. The authors demonstrated that \u201cC. pseudogenitalium\u201d strain ATCC 33035 also represents C. tuberculostearicum and showed that this species forms a distinct phylogenetic lineage together with C. accolens and C. macginleyi (8). Unfortunately, strains of CDC group G-2 were not included in this taxonomic study, which would clarify the phylogenetic relationship to C. tuberculostearicum (10). In the 1990s, several clinically relevant isolates of CDC group G-2 showing partial multiple antibiotic resistance were described (16, 23, 24). Up to now, there has been only one publication in the recent literature describing the isolation of C. tuberculostearicum from human infections. In 2002, Paviour and colleagues reported on the isolation of corynebacterial species, including C. tuberculostearicum, from pus from women with mastitis, implicating their possible involvement in cases of inflammatory breast disease (14). In this report, we provide clinical and microbiological information on 18 patients from whom C. tuberculostearicum was isolated and elaborate on its clinical significance and involvement in the infectious process. Furthermore, we present detailed data on its microbiological identification, including biochemistry, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis, as well as the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 16 strains in our collection."}]},{"title":"Pancreatic panniculitis complicated by infection with Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum: A case report","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum cause?","id":"48-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"pancreatic panniculitis","answer_start":21,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum sensitive to?","id":"48-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"linezolid","answer_start":196,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"We present a case of pancreatic panniculitis in a patient with alcohol abuse where Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum was isolated from a pannicular nodule on the crus.

The latter (i.e. mastitis) highlights its potential relevance in fatty tissue infections and also elucidates its potential role in infections emerging from inflammatory fatty tissue such as panniculitis. The deep punch biopsy from this patient's leg showed subcutaneous fat necrosis. Since C. tuberculostearicum is a lipophilic bacterium, the necrosis, apart from being a characteristic presentation of pancreatic panniculitis, could also be a result of possible bacterial lipase activity. However, we were not able to show lipase activity when testing in our laboratory. 15 of the 18 patients presented in Hinic et al's article [3] had a history of long hospital stays, and a majority had undergone prolonged therapy with broad-spectrum antimicrobials. This emphasises the role of C. tuberculostearicum in nosocomial infections. The patient presented in this case had prior to admission only been treated with penicillin. However, upon hospitalization broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy was initiated. Furthermore, the patient did have various underlying comorbidity as well as alcohol abuse rendering his immune system more susceptible to infections. Pancreatic disease is often associated with alcohol abuse. C. tuberculostearicum might therefore be of particular relevance in patients suffering from panniculitis caused by pancreatic disorders, since this patient group in general has a higher risk for developing infections [7]. In conclusion we find C. tuberculostearicum to be a possible etiologic agent in worsening of infections in the fatty tissue, in particular for patients with decreased immune defence. It seems probable that the symptoms presented in this case emerge from both pancreatic panniculitis and C. tuberculostearicum infection. If clinically relevant infection with C. tuberculostearicum is suspected long term treatment might be essential in order to eradicate the infection. Further studies on cultures from inflammatory nodules in patients with pancreatic panniculitis are warranted in order to establish the role of C. tuberculostearicum in this rare inflammatory condition."}]},{"title":"Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum, a human skin colonizer, induces the canonical nuclear factor-\u03baB inflammatory signaling pathway in human skin cells","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum normally exist?","id":"48-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"human skin","answer_start":85,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum (C. t.) is a ubiquitous bacterium that colonizes human skin. In contrast to other members of the genus Corynebacterium, such as toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae or the opportunistic pathogen Corynebacterium jeikeium, several studies suggest that C. t. may play a role in skin health and disease. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. To investigate whether C. t. induces inflammatory pathways in primary human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs) and human cutaneous squamous carcinoma cells (SCCs), cell culture, reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blot, chromatin immunoprecipitation\u2010PCR, small interfering RNA knockdown and luciferase reporter expression system were used. Herein, we demonstrate that C. t. upregulates the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of inflammatory mediators in two human skin cell lines, HEKs and SCCs. We further show activation of the canonical nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB) pathway in response to C. t. infection, including phosphorylation of the inhibitor of \u03baB (I\u03baB), the nuclear translocation of NF\u2010\u03baB subunit (NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010P65) and the recruitment of NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010P65 and RNA polymerase to the NF\u2010\u03baB response elements at the promoter region of the inflammatory genes. Lastly, the data confirm that C. t.\u2010induced tumor necrosis factor mRNA expression in HEKs is toll\u2010like receptor 2 (TLR2) dependent. Our results offer a mechanistic model for C. t.\u2010induced inflammation in human keratinocytes via TLR2 and activation of I\u03baB kinase and downstream signaling through the canonical NF\u2010\u03baB pathway. Relevance to chronic inflammatory diseases of the skin and cutaneous oncology is discussed."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum normally exist?","id":"48-3-2-1","answers":[{"text":"many skin microenvironments, whether dry, moist or sebaceous","answer_start":85,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum cause?","id":"48-3-2-2","answers":[{"text":"inflammatory breast disease, pancreatic panniculitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, and surgical site infections","answer_start":190,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Through shotgun metagenomics, C. t. has been identified as an important colonizer of many skin microenvironments, whether dry, moist or sebaceous.25 C. t. disease associations have included inflammatory breast disease, pancreatic panniculitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, and surgical site infections.26, 27, 28, 29 Using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, our laboratory has also shown that C. t. is more commonly identified in keratinocyte carcinomas (ie, basal and squamous cell carcinomas) as compared with matched, perilesional skin controls (data presented at the Canadian Dermatology Association's 93rd Annual Conference). Taken together, these data suggest that C. t. may play an important role in skin health and disease. As the major cellular component of the epidermis, keratinocytes have important barrier properties and are mediators of skin inflammation.54, 55 They produce various high\u2010molecular\u2010weight mucopolysaccharides, cytokines, chemokines, antimicrobial peptides, and cell adhesion molecules that recruit immune cells to sites of injury or infection.16, 55, 56 After a breach in the skin barrier, keratinocytes regulate an inflammatory response that mitigates microbial invasion.57 Unregulated and persistent cutaneous inflammation may lead to chronic inflammatory disease and, possibly, cancer.58, 59, 60, 61 Furthermore, data suggest that inflammatory responses to infection are linked to 15% to 20% of cancer deaths worldwide.62 We, therefore, asked the following question: does C. t. play a role in cutaneous inflammation and, if so, what are the underlying mechanisms? The microbial infection has been shown to trigger the activation of TLR via the canonical NF\u2010\u03baB pathway.41, 42, 63, 64 In this report, we demonstrate C. t., not only elicits inflammation but also upregulates the expression of TLR2, hence potentially amplifying and perpetuating the inflammatory response to TLR2 stimuli in human keratinocytes. These data collectively indicate that C. t. upregulated proinflammatory mRNAs and proteins involved in the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway. Furthermore, in both HEKs and SCC cells, C. t., the opportunistic C. j. and the skin commensal S. e. showed differential mRNA expression. Our results support the notion that C. t. upregulates proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules in keratinocytic cells, both primary cultures and SCC lines, through activation of the canonical NF\u2010\u03baB pathway. In keeping with other bacterial pathogens, we confirmed the inflammatory role played by IKK.65, 66, 67, 68, 69 Using fluorescent microscopy and Western blot analysis, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of I\u03baB is C. t.\u2010dependent. Furthermore, the inhibition of IKK by the specific inhibitor PS\u2010114570 significantly reduced the mRNA and protein expression of proinflammatory molecules induced by C. t., indicating these effects are mediated, at least in major part, by IKK. P\u2010I\u03baB, generated by IKK activation, is directed to proteasomal degradation, thereby allowing the translocation of NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010P65 subunit to the nucleus and resultant transcription of target genes.71, 72 In agreement with this molecular pathway, our results confirm that C. t. promotes NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010P65 nuclear translocation and subsequent attachment to the consensus binding sites of NF\u2010kB at the promoter region of IL1\u03b2, IL6, and CSF3 genes. Although transcription factor binding to cis\u2010 or trans\u2010acting DNA sequences is required to initiate transcription, it does not universally guarantee transcription; modification of the neighboring chromatin microenvironment is also needed to regulate the recruitment of RNA Pol and other cofactors to the transcriptionally active locus.73, 74, 75 Herein, we showed enhanced RNA Pol\u2010II occupancy at the promoter regions of IL1\u03b2, IL6, and CSF3 genes in the C. t.\u2010 and TNF\u2010treated cells, confirming ongoing stimulus\u2010induced and active transcription. As a reporter expression system recapitulates the activity of the DNA sequence from an actual gene, the pTNF3\u2032NF\u2010\u03baB luciferase reporter was used to provide quantitative measurements of transcription in response to C. t. stimulation. pTNF3\u2032NF\u2010\u03baB contains several NF\u2010\u03baB binding sequences and is induced by TNF.34 In the present study, pTNF3\u2032NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010transfected HEKs and SCC cells exhibited significantly greater luciferase activity than that reported in nontransfected cells. Furthermore, the luciferase activities were significantly increased in keratinocyte\u2010derived cells treated with C. t. (which enhances cellular TNF; see Figure \u200bFigure1),1), and these effects were dramatically reduced in cells pretreated with PS\u20101145, an inhibitor of IKK. Collectively, these results demonstrate that C. t. induced proinflammatory mediators in HEKs and SCC cells, in part by activation of the canonical NF\u2010\u03baB pathway. Although NF\u2010\u03baB is a crucial regulator of host defenses, its dysregulation is associated with chronic inflammatory skin diseases.76, 77, 78 The C. t.\u2010mediated inflammatory effect in human keratinocytes is shown to be an NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010dependent process, attenuated successfully by inhibition of IKK. We propose that C. t. could initiate and\/or perpetuate chronic inflammatory diseases or malignancies of skin through subversion of the NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathway. The unique inductive effects of C. t., as compared with C. j. or S. e., on proinflammatory cytokines in keratinocyte\u2010derived cell lines support the potential for microbe\u2010specific predisposition to inflammatory skin diseases or malignancy. Future studies will investigate (a) the mechanistic impact of environmental, immunogenetic, and microbial determinants of the C. t. activation on inflammatory pathways in human skin; (b) the relevance of the specific inflammatory mediators induced by C. t. vs other microbes, and (c) the relevance of C. t. to keratinocyte carcinomas, including basal cell carcinoma and SCC."}]}]},{"species":"Corynebacterium minutissimum","docs":[{"title":"Corynebacterium minutissimum bacteremia in an immunocompetent host with cellulitis","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Corynebacterium minutissimum cause?","id":"49-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"cellulitis and bacteremia","answer_start":182,"id":1},{"text":"erythrasma","answer_start":94,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Since its original description in 1961, Corynebacterium minutissimum, the causative agent of erythrasma, has rarely been associated with extracutaneous disease.

It was not until the wide application of molecular biology techniques that the function of L. iners in the vaginal microbiome was carefully explored. L. iners has the smallest genome among known Lactobacilli and it has many probiotic characteristics, but is partly different from other major vaginal Lactobacillus species, such as L. crispatus, in contributing to the maintenance of a healthy vaginal microbiome. It is not only commonly present in the healthy vagina but quite often recovered in high numbers in bacterial vaginosis (BV). Increasing evidence suggests that L. iners is a transitional species that colonizes after the vaginal environment is disturbed and offers overall less protection against vaginal dysbiosis and, subsequently, leads to BV, sexually transmitted infections, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Accordingly, under certain conditions, L. iners is a genuine vaginal symbiont, but it also seems to be an opportunistic pathogen.

There have been case reports of M. osloensis causing bacteremia, central venous catheter-related infection, pneumonia, meningitis, and endophthalmitis. The most fluent isolate is from blood samples, as in the present case. M. osloensis is usually considered a Gram-negative bacillus, although in the present case, Gram staining revealed both Gram-negative small bacilli to coccobacilli. This variation in Gram staining pattern and morphology has been reported before. We could definitively identify the isolate as M. osloensis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which has been reported as a useful method for precise identification. This method improves clinical microbiological identification by allowing better identification of poorly described organisms like M. osloensis. With respect to treatment, penicillins, cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides are usually effective against M. osloensis. In the present case, the patient was successfully treated with a 2-week course of cefepime. Mortality from central venous catheter-related infection caused by M. osloensis seems to be low. Moreover, in many cases, catheter-related infection caused by this organism resolves without the need for removal of the central venous catheter, as in the present case. In general, the Infectious Diseases Society of America guideline recommends removal of the catheter in patients with catheter-related bloodstream infection caused by Gram-negative bacilli. While we also basically recommend removal of a central venous catheter under these circumstances in infections caused by M. osloensis, successful control of the infection may be achieved without removal of the central venous catheter. In conclusion, we report here a case of central venous catheter-related infection caused by M. osloensis and successful control of the infection with antibiotic therapy without removal of the central catheter. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of central catheter-related infection caused by M. osloensis reported in Japan. The causative organism was identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. M. osloensis can be a causative pathogen of catheter-related infection among immunocompromised patients, especially in those with underlying cancer, and may be a more important human pathogen than previously thought."}]},{"title":"Infection due to Moraxella osloensis: case report and review of the literature","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Moraxella osloensis cause?","id":"56-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":61,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" We describe the successful treatment of Moraxella osloensis bacteremia in a 2-year-old boy who presented with fever, petechial rash, and exacerbation of reactive airway disease.

However, the role of the associated bacterium in the pathogenicity of the nematode to the slug is unknown. We discovered that M. osloensis alone is pathogenic to D. reticulatum after injection into the shell cavity or hemocoel of the slug. The bacteria from 60-h cultures were more pathogenic than the bacteria from 40-h cultures, as indicated by the higher and more rapid mortality of the slugs injected with the former. Coinjection of penicillin and streptomycin with the 60-h bacterial culture reduced its pathogenicity to the slug. Further work suggested that the reduction and loss of pathogenicity of the aged infective juveniles of P. hermaphrodita to D. reticulatum result from the loss of M. osloensis from the aged nematodes. Also, axenic J1\/J2 nematodes were nonpathogenic after injection into the shell cavity. Therefore, we conclude that the bacterium is the sole killing agent of D. reticulatum in the nematode-bacterium complex and that P. hermaphrodita acts only as a vector to transport the bacterium into the shell cavity of the slug.

The bacterium can grow in mineral medium with acetate and ammonium salts and produces oxidase and catalase but is sensitive to penicillin. M. osloensis is occasionally isolated from the upper respiratory tract, genitourethral specimens, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and pyogenic manifestations in joints, bursae, and other sites in humans (1). The bacterium is considered an opportunistic human pathogen and has been found to cause diseases, such as endocarditis (22), osteomyelitis (23), central venous catheter infection (4), and meningitis (11). M. osloensis has also been found to be associated with Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita (Rhabditida: Peloderinae), a lethal nematode parasite of slugs (26). This bacterium-feeding nematode has potential for the biological control of mollusk pests, including the grey garden slug, Deroceras reticulatum (Stylommatophora: Limacidae), which is often regarded as the most serious pest of agricultural and horticultural plants (15, 21, 25). As with the entomopathogenic nematodes in the genera Heterorhabditis and Steinernema, the parasitic cycle of P. hermaphrodita is initiated by the third-stage infective juveniles. The infective juveniles invade D. reticulatum through the dorsal integumental pouch immediately posterior to the mantle, enter the shell cavity via a short canal, and then develop into self-fertilizing hermaphrodites that produce progeny, resulting in host death (25). When the food source is depleted, the nematodes form the next generation of infective juveniles, which leave the cadaver to search for new hosts. Unlike Heterorhabditis and Steinernema, which are associated with one particular bacterium each in the genera Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus, respectively (13), P. hermaphrodita has been found to be associated with many different species of bacteria. Wilson et al. (27) recovered more than 150 bacterial isolates from inside infective juveniles of P. hermaphrodita, from living and dead D. reticulatum, and from xenic foam chip cultures of the nematodes, including M. osloensis. Nine bacterial isolates were selected and studied, and only two isolates from 24-h cultures (Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens isolate 140) were found to be pathogenic to D. reticulatum when they were injected into the hemocoel of the slug. However, nematodes grown with M. osloensis or P. fluorescens (isolate 141) were pathogenic, those grown with Providencia rettgeri produced inconsistent results, and those grown with Serratia proteamaculans and P. fluorescens (isolate 140) were nonpathogenic to the slug. Finally, Wilson et al. (27) selected M. osloensis as the preferred associated bacterium to mass-produce P. hermaphrodita in monoxenic culture. A commercial product, NemaSlug, based on P. hermaphrodita has been developed in England. However, a high dose of the nematodes (3 \u00d7 10 infective juveniles\/ha) is required for effective plant protection in the field (17). Pathogenicity of the mass-produced nematodes varies among different batches. Further, aged P. hermaphrodita nematodes are less virulent than young ones. All of these factors restrict further development of the product. Therefore, information on the virulence mechanism of the nematode-bacterium complex is necessary to develop mass-production systems that maintain high and stable nematode pathogenicity. Availability of a high-quality biological control agent is needed to manage slug pests in landscapes, nurseries, and field crops worldwide. The present study was conducted to discern the real virulent agent in the nematode-bacterium complex. Wilson et al. (27) reported that a 24-h culture of M. osloensis that is injected into the D. reticulatum hemocoel is not pathogenic. As the shell cavity in the posterior mantle region, and not the mouth or genital pore, serves as the main portal of entry for P. hermaphrodita (24), it is predicted that the nematode carries M. osloensis first into the shell cavity and not the hemocoel. Since important organs, including the kidney, lung, and heart, are located in the mantle region, it is possible that M. osloensis alone may kill the slug without entering the hemocoel. Therefore, we hypothesized that M. osloensis vectored into the shell cavity could be pathogenic to the slug. We also hypothesized that the pathogenicity of M. osloensis may vary with the age and number of the bacteria."}]},{"title":"Peritonitis due to Moraxella Osloensis: An Emerging Pathogen","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether M. osloensis is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"56-6-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-negative","answer_start":744,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Moraxella osloensis cause?","id":"56-6-1-2","answers":[{"text":"peritonitis","answer_start":423,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are M. osloensis sensitive to?","id":"56-6-1-3","answers":[{"text":"cephalosporin","answer_start":908,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Peritonitis is a very serious complication encountered in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis and healthcare providers involved in the management should be very vigilant.

Most common organisms causing peritonitis are gram-positive bacteria from skin flora accounting for more than 60% of cases [4]. Peritonitis from gram-negative bacteria is less frequent and fungal peritonitis is rare. Peritonitis from Moraxella catarrhalis has been reported frequently, but only two cases of peritonitis by Moraxella osloensis have been reported to date [2, 3]. Moraxella is a genus of aerobic, gram-negative, nonmotile, oxidase positive coccobacilli [5]. They were initially included in genus Neisseria and later transferred to genus Branhamella and finally got the status of their own [5]. Moraxella are normal commensals of skin and mucosa. These are unusual pathogens in humans except M. catarrhalis, which causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections. The other medically important species are M. atlantae, M. lacunata, M. nonliquefaciens, and M. osloensis [5]. M. osloensis has been reclassified as a separate species in 1967 [6] and prior to that has been grouped along with M. nonliquefaciens. The bacterium has been isolated from multiple environmental sources like sinks, laundry [7], anesthetic agents [8], and slug parasite nematode [9]. Our patient had a history of gardening, the day before the presentation with peritonitis, which could have led to the touch contamination, as the bacterium is present in slug parasite nematode. Fewer than 40 cases of infections by M. osloensis have been reported in literature causing bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and pneumonia [1, 10\u201315]. M. osloensis is not promptly identifiable and pleomorphic appearance on gram stain adds to the diagnostic dilemma. New technologies are playing a critical role in identifying M. osloensis, which was underdiagnosed previously. RNA gene sequence analysis is the primary method of diagnosing the bacterium and accurate diagnosis is of utmost importance [16]. There are no established guidelines on the treatment of M. osloensis because of sparse cases of infection caused by the bacteria in literature.

The code obtained by API 20 NE (BioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy L'Etoile, France) strips was 0000004, corresponding to Moraxella sp. (82.3%). No identification was obtained when the ID 32 GN (BioM\u00e9rieux) strips were used. This phenotypic profile did not initially lead to an identification, but in retrospect it was found to be consistent with the genotypic identification as M. atlantae. Susceptibility was tested with the disk diffusion technique. No criteria are available for interpretation of the results, but because of the large inhibition zones, the strain was considered to be susceptible to all tested antibiotics, namely ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, cefuroxime, gentamicin, colimycin, temocillin, and ciprofloxacin. Since no initial phenotypic identification could be obtained, the isolate was subjected to genotypic identification. Initially, identification with tRNA-PCR (13) in combination with capillary electrophoresis (1, 12) failed because no entries for M. atlantae were present in our tRNA-fingerprint library. However, since this M. atlantae isolate had tRNA spacer fragments with lengths of 116, 133, and 270 bp, a pattern which is different from all other members of the genus Moraxella and from those obtained for all bacterial species tested thus far, addition of this fingerprint to the library should enable future identification by means of tRNA-intergenic spacer-length polymorphism analysis. Two M. atlantae culture collection strains (CCUG 10707 and CCUG 31324) were shown to have tRNA spacer fragments with identical lengths. 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing was carried out as published before (11). Briefly, the complete 16S rRNA gene was amplified, followed by sequencing reactions using the Big Dye Terminator Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) and analysis of the obtained fragments on the ABI 310 capillary electrophoresis apparatus (Applied Biosystems). Total gene assembling of the obtained fragments, alignment, and clustering were done with GeneBase (Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium). The obtained sequence (1,354 bp) was compared to all known sequences in the GenBank by Blast (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, Md.; http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/blast\/index.html). The Blast search resulted in a similarity of almost 99% with the only M. atlantae sequence present (GenBank number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AF005191\",\"term_id\":\"2155392\"}}AF005191). However, the sequences obtained for the M. atlantae strain of this study and for the GenBank M. atlantae strain contained two regions with substantial differences. Therefore, two M. atlantae culture collection strains (CCUG 10707 and CCUG 31324) were sequenced. This revealed other differences in the same regions. Those differences appeared to be nonrandom. For region 1 (Escherichia coli position 201 to 218), sequences a (TTTWGGGTTC) and b (GCGAGAGCTTT) were observed. Sequence a was present in strain CCUG 10707 and the strain of this case report, and sequence b was observed for the GenBank entry {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AF005191\",\"term_id\":\"2155392\"}}AF005191. Strain CCUG 31324 apparently carried different alleles from either one or both sequences, since the ambiguities in the sequence obtained for this strain corresponded to a mixture of both sequences found in the other strains (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1).1). For region 2 (E. coli position 455 to 478), two possible sequences were seen, with strain CCUG 10707 and the GenBank entry {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AF005191\",\"term_id\":\"2155392\"}}AF005191 having one possible sequence and CCUG 31324 and our clinical isolate having the other. Other points of difference were found at E. coli position 381 (either C or G), E. coli position 668 (either A or G), E. coli position 848 (either C or T), and E. coli position 1136 (either A or G). Alignment of two variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of four M. atlantae strains. IUB codes: S, C or G; Y, C or G; K, G or T; W, A or T; R, A or G. Sequences: 1, M. atlantae CCUG 10707 (GenBank no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AJ417491\",\"term_id\":\"17978240\"}}AJ417491); 2, M. atlantae CCUG 31324 (GenBank no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AJ417492\",\"term_id\":\"17978241\"}}AJ417492); 3, M. atlantae CDCA1922 (GenBank no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AF005191\",\"term_id\":\"2155392\"}}AF005191); 4, M. atlantae CCUG 45702, the clinical strain of this study (GenBank no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AJ313278\",\"term_id\":\"21684791\"}}AJ313278); 5, E. coli ATCC 11775 (GenBank no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"X80725\",\"term_id\":\"1240022\"}}X80725). In fact, all four strains have highly identical 16S ribosomal DNA sequences which at some regions are different mixtures of a few basic themes, probably reflecting past recombination events (5, 9). Furthermore, strain CCUG 31324 appears to have alleles with different sequences in a region between E. coli positions 201 and 218 whereby one or more cistrons have sequence a while one or more others have sequence b. The 16S rRNA sequences of two M. atlantae isolates were compared with those of other moraxellae (including a more complete sequence of Moraxella lincolnii obtained in this study), Psychrobacter immobilis and Psychrobacter phenylpyruvicus, and the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus type strain (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2).2). Psychrobacter and Acinetobacter are genera which belong to the Moraxellaceae as well. A dendrogram of 16S rRNA gene sequences was constructed using the GeneBase software package. First, pairwise alignment using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean was carried out with a gap penalty of 100%, a unit gap cost of 20%, and an ambiguity cost of 50% of the mismatch cost. Subsequently, global alignment with A. calcoaceticus as the outgroup was carried out on the region corresponding to positions 60 through 1334 of the 16S rRNA gene of E. coli, with costs as described above. Finally, a similarity matrix of the aligned sequences was constructed by global alignment homology calculation and a gap penalty of 20%. The neighbor-joining method was used to construct the dendrogram based on this similarity matrix (7). Cluster analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences of M. atlantae and other Moraxellaceae. Cluster analysis was based on the neighbor-joining method, with A. calcoaceticus as the outgroup. The bar indicates 1% homology divergence. The numbers in parentheses are references. This revealed that in fact the species Moraxella osloensis, M. lincolnii, and M. atlantae could be classified as separate genera, based on a less than 95% sequence relatedness to each other, to the other moraxellae, and to Psychrobacter. The similarity percentages were 91 for M. atlantae versus M. lincolnii, 92 for M. atlantae versus M. osloensis, 89 for M. atlantae versus the other moraxellae, 93 for M. lincolnii versus M. osloensis, and 89 for M. atlantae versus P. immobilis and P. phenylpyruvicus. The sequence differences between the two Psychrobacter species amounted to 5.7% as well. The suggestion that these species could be classified as separate genera is in correspondence to earlier reports based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing (8), DNA-DNA hybridization (10), and DNA transformation (2). M. atlantae is an unusual and only rarely isolated bacterium, formerly known as CDC group M-3. B\u00f8vre et al. (2) described five strains isolated from blood cultures, all with the tendency to spread on blood agar plates, but without mentioning the clinical importance. The strain of the only case report thus far (3) was isolated from a blood culture of a 25-year-old patient suffering from systemic lupus erythematosis and had the same biochemical and phenotypic characteristics as the strain from the present case report. M. atlantae is a rare opportunistic pathogen that is apparently susceptible to most common antibiotics. This\u2014together with the difficulties encountered in most laboratories in the identification of gram-negative nonfermenters\u2014may cause possible underestimation of its occurrence. For example, the Culture Collection of the University of G\u00f6teborg (CCUG) harbors 12 M. atlantae strains, of which 10 were isolated since 1981. Ten are from blood, one from pleural fluid, and one from a dog bite wound. Unambiguous identification of this organism is possible by means of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, tRNA-PCR, and phenotypic characteristics. Short, nonmotile, gram-negative rods forming small colonies, possessing twitching motility and corroding activity on blood agar, capable of growing on MacConkey agar, oxidase and catalase positive, not acidifying sugars, negative for nitrate reduction, urease, acetate assimilation, and tributyrin hydrolysis, and positive for pyrrolidone peptidase can be considered M. atlantae.  The sequences of the 16S rRNA genes from M. atlantae and M. lincolnii obtained in this study were deposited under GenBank numbers {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AJ313278\",\"term_id\":\"21684791\"}}AJ313278 and {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AJ417490\",\"term_id\":\"17978239\"}}AJ417490, respectively."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Moraxella atlantae is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"58-2-3-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-negative","answer_start":816,"id":1},{"text":"gram-negative","answer_start":1720,"id":2},{"text":"gram-negative","answer_start":10982,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of M. atlantae?","id":"58-2-3-2","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":10352,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are M. atlantae sensitive to?","id":"58-2-3-3","answers":[{"text":"most common antibiotics","answer_start":10409,"id":1},{"text":"ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, cefuroxime, gentamicin, colimycin, temocillin, and ciprofloxacin","answer_start":3104,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Moraxella atlantae's requirement for oxygen?","id":"58-2-3-4","answers":[{"text":"aerobic","answer_start":962,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Moraxella atlantae?","id":"58-2-3-5","answers":[{"text":"rod-shaped","answer_start":1698,"id":1},{"text":"short, plump, rod-shaped to coccoid","answer_start":1684,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"In April 2001 a 31-year-old female patient was admitted to the oncology department with a history of intermittent fever for more than 1 week and with complaints of right hypochondrial pain and rectal cramps. The patient had a rectal adenocarcinoma that was diagnosed 1 year previously, with recent massive liver metastasis which had been treated with an anterior resection and with palliative chemotherapy (irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil) for 10 months. Clinical examination revealed a relapse of the rectal cancer at the anastomosis and a hepatomegaly of 8 cm. X-ray examination of the thorax revealed no infiltrates. Three pairs of blood cultures and a urine culture were carried out, with the latter being negative. Streptococci of the viridans group were isolated from one aerobically incubated culture bottle. A gram-negative rod, susceptible to all antibiotics tested and later identified as Moraxella atlantae (CCUG 45702), was isolated from the two other aerobic bottles. The anaerobic cultures remained negative. The patient was treated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (875 mg) two times a day, resulting in the disappearance of the fever after 2 days, whereafter the patient was dismissed. A computed tomography of the abdomen 7 days later showed an abscess around the rectum, which was drained with evacuation of 100 ml of serous fluid. Culture of this fluid remained negative. The patient died 4 months later as a result of her underlying disease. The blood culture bottles (FA aerobic and SN anaerobic bottles; Organon Teknika, Boxtel, The Netherlands) were inoculated with 10 ml of blood and incubated in the Bact\/Alert 3D system (Organon Teknika). Gram staining showed short, plump, rod-shaped to coccoid gram-negative rods. On tryptic soy agar plus 5% sheep blood (Becton Dickinson, Erembodegem, Belgium), colonies were small and grayish, with twitching motility and corroding activity. The isolate grew well on MacConkey agar, in contrast to most other Moraxella sp. It was nonmotile. Catalase and oxidase were positive. No sugars were acidified, either fermentatively or oxidatively. No growth was observed on triple sugar iron agar. Nitrate reduction and production of indol, urease, phenylalanine deaminase, lysine and ornithine decarboxylases, and arginine dihydrolase were negative.

There are only a handful of case reports implicating the organism as a cause of endocarditis, bacteraemia, septic arthritis and endophthalmitis. Identification to the species level based on routine laboratory techniques has been challenging, with final identification often made through 16S rRNA sequencing. With the use of a newer diagnostic tool, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS, we were able to rapidly identify the organism and initiate appropriate treatment. Case presentation. We present a rare care of M. nonliquefaciens meningitis in a paediatric patient with an underlying cranial anatomical defect due to Crouzon syndrome. She had been admitted to hospital 3 months previously with Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis and mastoiditis, and returned to the emergency department with meningismus. CSF culture grew M. nonliquefaciens. She was treated with ceftriaxone with rapid improvement and eventually was taken for endoscopic surgical repair of a right encephalocele defect. Conclusion. The use of MALDI-TOF MS allowed for the rapid identification of the organism. The patient recovered with appropriate antimicrobial therapy and eventual surgical correction. An underlying anatomical defect should be considered in all patients who present with meningitis due to this unusual organism.

The genus Moraxella includes seven species, the most common of which is Moraxella catarrhalis, a frequent cause of otitis media in children and of infectious exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults [15, 16]. M. nonliquefaciens is a usually non-pathogenic microorganism that exists as part of the upper respiratory tract flora [1]. It has been reported as an occasional cause of localized invasive infections, including meningitis [2], endophthalmitis [3, 4], endocarditis [5\u20137], pneumonia [8], and septic arthritis [17]. Immediately life-threating conditions in the form of bloodstream infections seem to be even more rare: Including the case presented here, only five cases of M. nonliquefaciens bacteremia have been reported in the literature to date [9\u201312] (Table \u200b(Table1).1). In all cases, underlying diseases may have acted as predisposing factors: three patients presented with hemato-oncological disorders and treatment-induced neutropenia, and the remaining two patients had significant comorbidities. This suggests that M. nonliquefaciens has a relevant pathogenicity potential in immunocrompromised and critically ill patients, while it is unlikely to cause disease in healthy hosts. Bloodstream-associated and catheter-associated infections with other Moraxella species have been reported in cancer patients in association with chemotherapy-related mucositis [18], which constitutes a plausible portal of entry also in our patient. The ability to produce biofilms observed in M. nonliquefaciens and other Moraxella species [15] and the interaction with other microorganisms within this milieu can contribute to bacterial persistence and resistance against antibiotic treatment [19]. In spite of the lack of specific susceptibility breakpoints for M. nonliquefaciens, an in vitro resistance pattern frequent in the genus Moraxella was observed, with resistance against penicillin, amoxicillin, ampicillin und piperacillin and susceptibility to piperacillin plus tazobactam that suggest the production of \u03b2-lactamases [20]. Although not possible to prove, and based on the evidence regarding the pathogenicity of M. nonliquefaciens in immunocompromised patients, the clinical deterioration of our patient at day two of appropriate antibacterial therapy with prompt recovery after removal of the indwelling central venous catheter suggests a role of biofilm in the pathogenesis of the evolving sepsis. This supports the importance of immediate source control for successful management of bloodstream infections by M. nonliquefaciens. Although very infrequently, Moraxella nonliquefaciens may cause bloodstream infections, especially in immunocompromised patients. A successful therapeutic approach should include prompt source control and administration of adequate antibiotic therapy."}]},{"title":"Pneumonitis and pulmonary abscess associated with Moraxella nonliquefaciens","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Moraxella nonliquefaciens cause?","id":"59-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"pneumonitis and pulmonary abscess","answer_start":24,"id":1},{"text":"sinusitis and bronchitis","answer_start":302,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" A 78-year-old man with pneumonitis and pulmonary abscess associated with Moraxella nonliquefaciens is presented.

Medline database was used to conduct a systematic review from inception to January 2020 looking for English-language articles focused on N. farcinica cerebral abscess, in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines.    Results:  The research yielded 54 articles for a total of 58 patients. N. farcinica cerebral abscess displayed three different neuroimaging patterns: a single multiloculated abscess in half of the cases, multiple cerebral abscesses, or a small paraventricular abscess with meningitis. The patients who benefited from surgical excision of the abscess showed a trend towards a lower risk of surgical revision (8% versus 31%, P=0.06) and a lower mortality rate (8% versus 23%, P=0.18) than patients who benefited from needle aspiration. Twenty-two percent of the patients benefited from microbiological documentation from another site with a mortality rate of 23%.    Conclusion:  Urgent multimodal MRI is necessary in face with clinical suspicion of cerebral nocardiosis. In case of single or multiple small cerebral abscesses, microbiological documentation can be obtained with puncture of pseudotumoral visceral lesions. In case of large or symptomatic cerebral abscess, an aggressive surgical excision seems a reliable option and can be preferred over needle aspiration. Long-term antibiotic therapy with cotrimoxazole is necessary thereafter.

It is a ubiquitous bacterium naturally present in food. It is one of the major starter cultures used for meat fermentation [[1], [2], [3]]. S. xylosus can cause bovine mastitis, and hence, it is a clinically relevant pathogen in veterinary medicine [12]. In humans, few reports described S.xylosus infection in hosts with comorbidities [3,10,11]. PJI is a severe complication following joint replacement. No classification system of PJI is unanimously accepted. On the basis of the two major infection routes, PJI can be classified as either exogenous or hematogenous infection. When considering the virulence of bacteria and the host response of immunocompetent patients, PJI can be classified on the basis of symptoms as acute or chronic. The traditional classification differentiates among early (those developing within <3 months after implantation), delayed (3\u201324 months after surgery), and late (>24 months after implantation) infection. In clinical practice, it is more useful to classify PJI as follows: 1. Acute hematogenous PJI: Infection with 3 weeks or less of duration of symptoms after an uneventful postoperative period 2. Early postinterventional PJI: Infection that manifests within 1 month after an invasive procedure (surgery or arthrocentesis) 3. Chronic PJI: Infection with symptoms that persist for more than 3 weeks and are beyond the early postinterventional period This simple classification allows the differentiation between PJI which can be potentially cured with d\u00e9bridement and implant retention, and the infection requiring device removal for cure. Acute hematogenous infection is generally caused by virulent bacteria and requires d\u00e9bridement to retain the device. This type of PJI can occur at any time after surgery. The risk is highest within the first 3 months after implantation. However, most hematogenous infections occur late after surgery because the risk for hematogenous seeding persists lifelong. Early postoperative PJI manifests itself by poor wound healing, joint fluid accumulation, or persisting pain. In these cases, early detection by a high degree of suspicion, rapid diagnostic workup, and prompt surgical treatment is required for retention of the implant. In contrast, if these (exogenous) infections are not detected early after surgery (within the first month) or symptoms persist for more than 3 weeks, or both, chronic PJI develops irrespective of the infection route. This form of infection requires removal of all hardware and bone cement for cure. [20] The cumulative incidence of late PJI ranges between 0.3 % and 0.9 % [7,14].

In our reported case, the time interval from implantation to onset of symptoms plus the lack of a sinus tract indicated a haematogenous pathogenesis. The monoculture growth of the microorganism in two different samples obtained at two different time points strongly indicates that S. xylosus is the causative pathogen. The source of haematogenous seeding remains unknown and is speculative. One possible source could be the Salami consumption while suffering from a carious tooth chart, cutting his finger, especially while preparing Salami, or gingival microtraumata during dental care. The most common microbiological agents in haematogenous PJIs are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus spp. [17]. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) rarely cause haematogenous infections. Among CoNS, S.lugdunensis is typically associated with late infections [18], a species which resembles S. aureus in some regards. CoNS are frequently summarized and referred to as one group to distinguish them from Staphylococcus aureus (and other coagulase-positive staphylococcal species). CoNS in fact comprise a heterogeneous group, ranging from true nonpathogenic to facultative pathogenic species with low, medium or even high virulence potential [19]. However, detailed species identification may help to allocate data with respect to host (e.g.; exchange between humans and animals) or anatomical colonization site of the human body. Considering the increasing application of sophisticated molecular methods for species identification in routine clinical microbiology, it is possible that the group of CoNS causing PJIs will be divided in more detail. The aforementioned taxonomy grouping may explain why, to the best of our knowledge, PJI due to S. xylosus has only been reported once previously [13]. Samples showing CoNS growth lead to challenging situations. CoNS are frequent contaminants of blood samples and therefore CoNS may mistakenly be disregarded as the causative agent for infections of any kind. [15]. In suspected PJIs, where only aspirated joint fluid is positive for CoNS (and no microbiological growth in tissue samples, negative sonication and normal histology) it therefore is difficult to define whether there effectively is PJI or a contamination. Considering the patients clinical symptomps and due to the patient history with fever and a second arthrocentesis again showing S. xylosus there was little doubt about the presence of PJI and that the causative agent was S. xylosus. Time interval from implantation and onset of symptoms to certain diagnosis of PJI is an important variable. It helps to estimate the possible pathogenesis and the duration of PJI, and hence, the surgical and antibiotic therapy regime. It also underlines the importance of life long oral hygiene following arthroplasty implantation [16]."}]}]},{"species":"Anaeroglobus geminatus","docs":[{"title":"Anaeroglobus geminatus gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel member of the family Veillonellaceae","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"How about Anaeroglobus geminatus's requirement for oxygen?","id":"63-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"anaerobic","answer_start":20,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Anaeroglobus geminatus?","id":"63-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"coccus","answer_start":30,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" A hitherto unknown anaerobic coccus isolated from a post-operative fluid collection was characterized by phenotypic and phylogenetic methods. 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed an affiliation of this isolate to the family Veillonellaceae.

Microbial biofilms growing on the tooth surface and consisting of a multitude of different species are the etiological factor of the initiation of the disease. Within biofilms, oral microbes display increased virulence and become more resistant to antibiotics and to the immune system, compared to living in planktonic form Despite the deleterious role of oral biofilms in periodontal infection, commensal oral bacteria actually support the maintenance of a healthy periodontium, by minimally priming the immune responses to a readiness level. Switch of a microbial community from a commensal to a \u201cdysbiotic\u201d one may result in exacerbated tissue-destructive inflammation. This requires the synergy between metabolically compatible microorganisms within the biofilm, and entails an imbalanced relationship with the host immune response. Thus, understanding the role and behaviour of different microbes as counterparts of a biofilm community is essential for understanding the microbiome shifts that act as a driving force for the establishment of periodontal infection. A large number of microorganisms have been identified as candidates in the etiology of periodontal infections, particularly with the development of novel molecular diagnostic technologies. Anaeroglobus geminatus was not reported until 2002, when it was directly characterized as a strictly anaerobic gram-negative coccus belonging to the family Veillonellaceae and closely related to Megasphaera spp. The prevalence of this species was found to be increased in patients with chronic periodontitis and apical periodontitis, correlating with low bleeding on probing scores (indicative of gingival inflammation), and higher proportion of colonization of subgingival sites in chronic and aggressive periodontitis. These clinical observations indicate that A. geminatus is associated with periodontal diseases, at least under certain circumstances. Yet, the influence of A. geminatus in the dynamic shifts occurring in an oral biofilm community has never been investigated. The preamble for oral biofilm formation is the attachment of bacteria on the tooth surface, followed by the sequential attachment and growth of further species, resulting in a complex microbial community with established inter-species communication. Therefore, polymicrobial in vitro biofilm models are a useful resource to study communication and behavioural interactions between species. For instance, by using such models it was determined that BspA proteins of Tannerella forsythia were not imperative for biofilm formation when grown together with P. gingivalis, despite their positive effect on co-aggregation. In addition, it was also determined that gingipains, a set of important virulence factors of P. gingivalis, regulate the behaviour of other species in biofilms. The lysine-specific gingipain favoured the growth of T. forsythia , while the Arginine-gingipain supported the growth of Treponema denticola in a dual-species, as well as a 10-species biofilm. This 10-species biofilm model consists of bacteria commonly represented in subgingival biofilms associated with periodontitis, and has proved to be a useful model in evaluating the effects of individual species within the oral biofilm community. As such, the model has recently been used to evaluate the role of Aggegatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in the biofilm community, by developing a label-free quantification proteomics workflow to study the internally regulated proteins. With this state-of-art liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) technology, it is possible to identify a plethora of proteins in a single run. In conjunction with label-free quantification, it is further possible to quantify the regulation of these identified proteins. In the present study we used this biofilm model and proteomic approach, with the aim to evaluate the changes brought by A. geminatus to other species and chart the protein regulatory patterns in the biofilm, induced by its presence. This is the first molecular approach to understand the mechanisms of actions of A. geminatus within biofilms, with potential implications in periodontal infections."}]}]},{"species":"Acinetobacter johnsonii","docs":[{"title":"Vascular catheter-related bloodstream infection due to Acinetobacter johnsonii (formerly Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. lwoffi): report of 13 cases","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Acinetobacter johnsonii normally exist?","id":"64-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"human skin","answer_start":319,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Acinetobacter johnsonii cause?","id":"64-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"catheter-related bloodstream infections","answer_start":484,"id":1},{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":758,"id":2},{"text":"bloodstream infection","answer_start":1030,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Although Acinetobacter baumannii (formerly Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratus) is known to be an important nosocomial pathogen, the clinical impact of other Acinetobacter species is not fully understood.

Identification within the genus is difficult and requires molecular methods, and these organisms are rarely identified to the species level using appropriate methods (3, 4, 6, 24). While A. baumannii can relatively readily be identified by detection of blaOXA-51-like, the intrinsic carbapenemase gene in this species (22), the use of rpoB sequencing has facilitated identification across the genus (5, 8), and it is becoming clear that other species, such as A. ursingii (which has also been called A. septicus [13]) and A. haemolyticus, are also important nosocomial pathogens in some cases (3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 24). rpoB sequencing has advantages over such techniques as amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, and those based on the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region, since there is a relatively high degree of polymorphism in this gene among the Acinetobacter species, and sequences are available for all the currently described species (8), including those more recently described (11-14). Our laboratory provides a typing and identification service for hospitals in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland for this organism, and here we describe the species found among 690 isolates of Acinetobacter, each from a different patient, submitted over a 20-month period during 2008\/2009, from some 135 hospitals. While A. baumannii, which is frequently associated with outbreaks, is still by far the most common of the Acinetobacter species among clinical isolates, it is clear that lesser-known species, such as A. lwoffii, A. ursingii, and A. parvus, are regularly encountered, have been associated with serious infections, and may represent emerging pathogens. The majority of isolates were received as Acinetobacter species for typing, identification, and\/or susceptibility determinations and were subjected to a multiplex PCR for detection of blaOXA-58-like, blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-51-like, blaOXA-40-like, and class 1 integrase genes, as described by Turton et al. (22), with the addition of primers for blaOXA-58-like (27). Detection of blaOXA-51-like was regarded as a positive identification of A. baumannii; the identity of a proportion of such isolates was also checked by rpoB sequence cluster analysis; in addition, many were shown by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to be further representatives of strains previously identified as A. baumannii, and all gave amplicons in a PCR to amplify variable-number tandem repeat loci found in A. baumannii (23). The remaining isolates were identified by rpoB sequence cluster analysis using primers described by La Scola et al. (8). Briefly, a 903-bp portion of the rpoB gene covering two variable regions was amplified using the primers Ac696F and Ac1598R. Amplicons were treated with Exo-SAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and four sequencing reactions were carried out, using the primers Ac696F, Ac1055F, Ac1093R, and Ac1598R, respectively. The resulting fragments were separated on a Beckman-Coulter CEQ8000 genetic analysis system or an Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA analyzer and aligned, and sequences of a 765-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides (nt) 2964 to 3728 of the coding sequence were compared using the BioNumerics software program; a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the MEGA software program (http:\/\/www.megasoftware.net\/mega41.html) (19) (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1).1). Sequences of reference isolates were also included, and isolates were identified both by BLAST searches and according to which species they clustered most closely with; as more isolates were added to the database, a measure of the extent of sequence diversity associated with each species was obtained, allowing determination of whether isolates clustered closely enough to be assigned to that species. Susceptibilities to at least 16 antibiotics were determined by agar dilution and interpreted using British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) breakpoints (http:\/\/www.bsac.org.uk). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of ApaI-digested genomic DNA was carried out as described previously (21). Phylogenetic tree of sequences corresponding to nt 2964 to 3728 of the rpoB coding sequence of isolates of Acinetobacter species. Clinical and reference isolates were included, with GenBank accession numbers being included with the latter. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4 (19) using the neighbor-joining method. One thousand replicates were used for bootstrap analysis. Using this method, we were able to identify most isolates to the species level, although isolates of A. lwoffii and genomic species 9 clustered too closely to be distinguished from one another, as did those of A. baylyi and genomic species 11 (A. guillouiae). Similarly, as has been observed by others (26), A. grimontii and A. junii could not be distinguished and are likely to be a single species. Three isolates (UA1 to -3), two of which had highly similar rpoB sequences, did not cluster closely enough with any of the described species and may represent new species. For all three, the closest currently described species is A. towneri. Isolates that were identified as A. radioresistens were PCR positive for blaOXA-23-like, the naturally occurring carbapenemase gene in this species (17), consistent with the identification. Detection of OXA carbapenemase genes among species other than A. baumannii was rare, with the only other examples being two isolates, one of genomic species 3 and the other of genomic species 16, with blaOXA-58-like. As expected, the majority (78.0%) of isolates were identified as A. baumannii; with A. lwoffii\/genomic species 9 (8.8%), A. ursingii (4.0%), genomic species 3 (1.7%), A. johnsonii (1.7%), and A. parvus (1.3%) accounting for most of the rest (Table \u200b(Table1).1). In most cases, these non-A. baumannii isolates were from blood and were associated with bacteremia or septicemia. Of note is that some isolates (of A. johnsonii, genomic species 13, and A. beijerinckii) were implicated in endocarditis; this has been described for other Acinetobacter species (7, 18, 28) but not these and provides further evidence that these organisms can cause life-threatening infections. The relatively high incidence of A. ursingii, which exceeded those of both genomic species 3 and 13TU, was unexpected but agrees with observations from hospitals in the Netherlands and Northern Ireland (2, 24). It has previously been documented that this organism has the capacity to cause bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients (4, 9, 11), and it has been associated with a nosocomial outbreak of bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive care unit, in which two babies died (6). The isolates in the present study were from 28 patients in 24 centers, suggesting that they were not epidemiologically related; nevertheless, three isolates, each from different centers, formed a cluster by PFGE (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Similarly, A. lwoffii has previously been linked with catheter-related bloodstream infections (20), as has A. parvus (12). Submissions of Acinetobacter sp. other than A. baumannii received during the study period and associated clinical information Antibiotic susceptibility investigation of isolates of A. ursingii (n = 14), A. lwoffii\/genomic species 9 (n = 5), A. johnsonii (n = 2), genomic species 3 (n = 3), 13 (n = 5), and 13TU (n = 1), A. calcoaceticus (n = 2), A. schindleri (n = 1), A. haemolyticus (n = 1), A. bereziniae (n = 1), A. gyllenbergii (n = 1), and A. beijerinckii (n = 1), largely requested by the sending laboratories, revealed that it was those of A. lwoffii\/genomic species 9 and A. schindleri that were susceptible to the greatest number of antibiotics, with isolates of genomic species 3, 13, and 13TU, A. bereziniae, and A. gyllenbergii exhibiting resistance (full or intermediate) to 8 or more of the 17 antibiotics tested (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). An isolate of genomic species 3 (genomic species 3_3) displayed resistance to 13 antibiotics, including the carbapenems; it was PCR positive for blaOXA-58-like, explaining the latter resistance. However, most of the non-A. baumannii isolates tested were susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, the carbapenems, sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, and minocycline, in stark contrast to the situation with A. baumannii. Isolates of A. ursingii were resistant to up to eight of the antibiotics tested. There were some notable differences between the species; all isolates tested of genomic species 13 and that of A. beijerinckii were resistant to colistin, one of the last antibiotics useful for treating A. baumannii infections; isolates of the other species tested were susceptible. A reference strain of genomic species 13 (ATCC 17905) was also found to be resistant to colistin, suggesting this resistance is intrinsic in this species, in agreement with recent observations by others (15). Three patients carried a single strain of genomic species 3, and a further strain was shared by two patients (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material), suggesting that transmission between patients may have occurred. As identification of species of Acinetobacter other than A. baumannii becomes more widely undertaken, their prevalence and the nature of infections associated with them will become clearer. Evidence from isolates submitted to our laboratory suggests that some of these species are associated with clinical infections in significant numbers of cases. Some isolates exhibited multiresistance, which may impact on therapy; carbapenem resistance in isolates of genomic species 3 (1) and colistin resistance in isolates of genomic species 13TU (16) have previously been described. In addition, some species, particularly genomic species 3, 13TU, and A. ursingii, have been associated with outbreaks (6, 10, 24, 25), suggesting that they may become increasingly important."}]}]},{"species":"Acinetobacter baumannii","docs":[{"title":"Acinetobacter baumannii: an emerging opportunistic pathogen","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Acinetobacter baumannii?","id":"65-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic bacterial pathogen","answer_start":30,"id":1},{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":373,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen primarily associated with hospital-acquired infections.

Due to clusters of closely related species, it is difficult to distinguish Acinetobacter taxonomy using phenotypic traits and chemotaxonomic methods. Because antibiotic susceptibility and clinical relevance are significantly different between different genomic species, exact identification of Acinetobacter species are required (Bergogne-Berezin and Towner, 1996; Dijkshoorn et al., 1996; Houang et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2007). Many genomic fingerprinting methods have been developed, including repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, ribotyping, amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis, random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), RNA spacer fingerprinting, amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis, and sequence analysis of 16S-23S rRNA intergene spacer regions or the rpoB and gyrB genes (Koeleman et al., 1998; Chang et al., 2005; La Scola et al., 2006; Croxatto et al., 2012; Higgins et al., 2012; Lee C. R. et al., 2015; Li X. M. et al., 2016). Among Acinetobacter species, Acinetobacter baumannii is the most important member associated with hospital-acquired infections worldwide (Lin and Lan, 2014). This aerobic Gram-negative coccobacillus had been regarded as a low-grade pathogen, but it is a successful pathogen responsible for opportunistic infections of the skin, bloodstream, urinary tract, and other soft tissues (Peleg et al., 2008). Because many A. baumannii infections have suddenly been reported among veterans and soldiers who served in Iraq and Afghanistan (Centers for Disease and Prevention, 2004), A. baumannii is referred to as \u201cIraqibacter.\u201d Multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii has spread to civilian hospitals in part by cross-infection of injured military patients repatriated from war zones (Peleg et al., 2008). Most A. baumannii infections occur in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting (Fournier and Richet, 2006) and account for up to 20% of infections in ICUs worldwide (Vincent et al., 2009). Furthermore, the frequency of community-acquired A. baumannii infections has been increasing gradually (Lin and Lan, 2014). Several virulence factors have been identified by genomic and phenotypic analyses, including outer membrane porins, phospholipases, proteases, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), capsular polysaccharides, protein secretion systems, and iron-chelating systems (Antunes et al., 2011; McConnell et al., 2013; Lin and Lan, 2014). Many reports have shown that A. baumannii rapidly develops resistance to antimicrobials, and multidrug-resistant strains have been isolated (McConnell et al., 2013). The WHO declared that A. baumannii is one of the most serious ESKAPE organisms (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, A. baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) that effectively escape the effects of antibacterial drugs (Boucher et al., 2009). A number of A. baumannii resistance mechanisms are known, including enzymatic degradation of drugs, target modifications, multidrug efflux pumps, and permeability defects (Gordon and Wareham, 2010; Kim et al., 2012; Lin and Lan, 2014). In this review, we summarize the virulence factors of A. baumannii, antibiotic resistance mechanisms, and the therapeutic options available for treating A. baumannii infections.

Use of animal models has produced important data regarding virulence factors that contribute to A. baumannii pathogenesis. Notably, some studies on metal acquisition and protein secretion systems are interesting. Besides iron acquisition systems such as acinetobactin, the discovery of zinc and manganese acquisition systems in A. baumannii broadens our understanding of A. baumannii pathogenesis. More extensive studies on various protein secretion systems present in A. baumannii are required. About 300 genes required for in vivo survival of A. baumannii were identified using transposon screening in G. mellonella larvae (Gebhardt et al., 2015). Because many of these genes were not known to be associated with A. baumannii pathogenesis, more detailed studies are required to determine whether these genes are related to the pathogenesis of A. baumannii. In addition, transposon screening in other model animals will provide novel insight into A. baumannii pathogenesis. Knowledge of virulence factors responsible for A. baumannii pathogenicity will be the cornerstone for developing novel antibiotics. For example, LPS is an important virulence factor and LpxC inhibitor, which inhibits LPS synthesis, completely protects mice from lethal infection (Lin et al., 2012). These results indicate that blocking LPS synthesis is a powerful strategy for discovering novel antibiotics. However, despite recent extensive studies about A. baumannii pathogenesis, the toxicity and pathogenicity of A. baumannii remain unclear. Recent interest about A. baumannii is mostly due to its seemingly endless capacity to acquire antibiotic resistance. A. baumannii has almost all bacterial resistance mechanisms. All class \u03b2-lactamases have been detected in A. baumannii and the frequency of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates is very high. Furthermore, almost all A. baumannii contain aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes and many efflux pumps responsible for resistance to various clinically important antibiotics have been identified in A. baumannii. Due to these abilities, available antibiotics to treat A. baumannii infections are significantly limited. Colistin is used as the antibiotic treatment of last resort, due to its relatively low resistance rate. However, emergence of colistin-resistant A. baumannii strains has increased worldwide with increasing use of colistin. Notably, some more recent studies have proposed that another polymyxin antibiotic, polymyxin B, is a potential therapeutic alternative to colistin (Lenhard et al., 2016a,b; Rao et al., 2016a; Repizo et al., 2015). Polymyxin B has not been a good antibiotic owing to dose-dependent nephrotoxicity, but recent reports show that a novel combination therapy with carbapenems or tigecycline using minimal concentrations of polymyxin B can be a good strategy to treat carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii infections. These results indicate the requirement for extensive studies that analyze the pharmacodynamics of polymyxin B in combination therapy. Various trials to identify a novel alternative to carbapenem or colistin have been performed. Among them, engineered endolysins (artilysins) are particularly interesting, despite evident defects. A lytic enzyme degrading peptidoglycan of bacteria is a promising novel class of antimicrobial agents due to its unique mode of action. Similar to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics that are one of the most successful antibiotics, inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis is a promising target of antimicrobial agents. Because lytic enzymes directly degrade peptidoglycans, but not proteins, the possibility of the emergence of a resistance mechanism is relatively low. In addition, enzymes with relatively high molecular weight are not inhibited by efflux pumps. If the short stability of artilysin in serum and high cost in its production compared with small molecules can be resolved, the improved artilysin can be a good treatment option for carbapenem- or colistin-resistant A. baumannii infections. In conclusion, novel, rationally designed strategies and screening-based approaches are required to discover new classes of antibiotics. If we continue to take all efforts at maintaining the effectiveness of antibiotics and developing novel antibiotics, effective control of A. baumannii infections can be successful."}]},{"title":"Insight into Acinetobacter baumannii: pathogenesis, global resistance, mechanisms of resistance, treatment options, and alternative modalities","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Acinetobacter baumannii resistant to?","id":"65-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"carbapenems, colistin, and tigecycline","answer_start":244,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Acinetobacter baumannii, once considered a low-category pathogen, has emerged as an obstinate infectious agent.

It is a frequent cause of pneumonia and septicemia in immunocompromised patients. It resists many classes of antibiotics by virtue of chromosome-mediated genetic elements on one hand, while it can also persist for a prolonged period in harsh environments (walls, surfaces, and medical devices) in the hospital settings on the other hand. A. baumannii was isolated for the first time from soil by a Dutch bacteriologist Beijerinck in 1911 and was described as Micrococcus calcoaceticus. In succeeding 50 years, the same bacterium was isolated many times and reported with different names such as Moraxella lwoffi, Alcaligenes hemolysans, Mirococcuscalco-aceticus, and Herellea vaginicola. Four decades later, Brisou and Prevot purposed to include it in the genus Achromobacter, based on its inability to move and being non-pigmented. In 1968, Baumann et al placed all such isolates in one genus Acinetobacter, which was accepted by the committee on the taxonomy of Moraxella and Allied Bacteria 4 years later. Based on DNA similarity, Bouvet and Grimont further classified it into 12 groups in 1986. Currently, they are taxonomically classified as \u03b3-proteobacteria, family Moraxellaceae and order Pseudomonadales. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex is a group of aerobic, non-fermentative, gram-negative coccobacillus that encompasses four different Acinetobacteria, comprising A. baumannii, Acinetobacter pittii, Acinetobacter nosocomialis, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. The first three are implicated in infections, while the latter is rarely considered pathogenic. It appears as Gram-negative coccobacillus in pairs ranging from 1 to 1.5 \u00b5m when observed under the microscope after gram staining. It often resists complete decolorization and can deceive as Gram-positive cocci. Nutritionally, it is aerobic, non-fastidious, and a non-fermenter. It is a non-motile organism and does not produce cytochrome oxidase, urease, citrate, and indole; however, it produces catalase enzyme. A. calcoaceticus-baumannii complex nurtures well at 35\u00b0C\u201337\u00b0C; however, some environmental isolates grow well in the temperature range of 20\u00b0C\u201330\u00b0C. A. baumannii is the only bacterium in the genus that can grow at 44\u00b0C. It grows well on routine laboratory media such as blood agar, chocolate agar, and MacConkey agar. On blood agar, it forms colorless, non-hemolytic, shiny mucoid colonies, smooth in contexture with a diameter of 1\u20132 mm after 18\u201324 hours of incubation at 37\u00b0C. It produces colorless colonies on MacConkey agar which are shiny mucoid and tomb shaped, indicating its non-lactose fermenting ability. On selective agar, Leeds Acinetobacter Medium, it gives pink color colonies when grown in the presence of supplement. Acinetobacter spp. are free-living saprophytic organisms and widely distributed in different environments including soil, water, wastewater, vegetables, and skin of animals and humans. They have been isolated from various body parts of healthy individuals, including the nose, ear, throat, forehead, trachea, conjunctiva, vagina and perineum, axillae, groin, hands, and toe webs; however, most strains isolated were other than A. baumannii. In hospital environment, they reside on beds, curtains, walls, roofs, medical devices, and equipment, as well as on belongings of medical personnel, tap water sinks, telephones, door handles, hand sanitizers, dispensers, trolleys, bins, and even on computers. They have the capacity to survive for prolonged periods on inanimate objects. The factors that are responsible for their persistence in a hospital environment are resistance to key antimicrobial drugs and disinfectants and their ability to survive in desiccants. A. baumannii has emerged as a major culprit involved in causing nosocomial infections, especially in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. The capability of this organism to pollute hospital surfaces for extended periods is linked with nosocomial outbreaks. It has gained the ability to infect not only hospitalized patients but also the general population. In hospital settings, it confers 26% mortality rate that goes up to 43% in ICUs. A. baumannii is a principal agent of ventilator-associated pneumonia, which accounts for nearly 15% of all hospital-acquired infections, with the highest morbidity and mortality in medical wards and especially in the ICUs. It accounts for ~50% of the total use of antibiotics in the ICUs. A. baumannii is not considered a community pathogen, but in immunocompromised individuals and in children, it populates tracheostomy sites and can cause community-acquired bronchiolitis and tracheobronchitis. It has also been implicated in community-acquired pneumonia with underlying conditions such as smoking, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, and COPD in tropical regions of Asia and Australia. A. baumannii has been implicated in bloodstream infections in 10%\u201315% of cases due to invasive procedures (intravascular or respiratory catheters, tubes, or cannulas). In 20%\u201370% of A. baumannii infections, the origin of infection remains unknown. A. baumannii is an increasing threat to neurosurgery patients. It is responsible for 4% of all meningitis and shunt-related infections, with 70% mortality rates. It is responsible for 2.1% of ICU-acquired wound infections; however, its prevalence is more pronounced (32%) in casualties from battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq. It is not a usual agent of urinary tract infections (UTIs); however, it can cause infection in debilitated elderly patients and in patients with prolonged indwelling catheter-related infections in the ICUs where it contributes 1.6% of the total UTIs. It may cause endocarditis, keratitis, and ophthalmitis following use of the contact lens and eye surgery. A. baumannii can be transmitted through the vicinity of affected patients or colonizers such as linens fomites, curtains, bed rails, tables, sinks, doors, feeding tubes, and even medical equipment. Contamination of respiratory support equipment, suction devices, and devices used for intravascular access is the key source of infection. A. baumannii is considered as a low-virulence pathogen, unless it is isolated from patients having comorbidities such as neonates with low birth weights and elderly patients with chronic illnesses such as malignancy. Major predisposing factors important in the acquisition of A. baumannii infection include prolonged hospital stay, mechanical ventilation, intravascular device, advanced age, immunosuppression, previous broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, previous sepsis, ICU stay, and enteral feedings. The intrusion of a microorganism requires cell-to-cell adhesion to establish infection; however, the capability of A. baumannii to anchor with cells\/mucosal cells is low as compared to other microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria meningitides, Campylobacter, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Helicobacter pylori. The reduced adhesion and invasion of A. baumannii attribute to its low virulence; however, it possesses a hydrophobic ability that provides attachment to foreign materials such as plastics used in intravascular devices. It has been proven that surface hydrophobicity is highly expressed in strains isolated from patients as compared to normal flora of the skin. Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) is associated with improving adhesion, specifically to the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. It localizes in the mitochondria and nuclei and induces expression of proapoptotic molecule cytochrome c, resulting in cell death. A. baumannii evades alternative complement pathway-mediated killing by neutralizing factor H, a key regulator of alternative complement pathway, with the help of OmpA. This phenomenon is known as serum resistance of A. baumannii. OmpA induces differentiation of CD4, activation and maturation of dendritic cells, and causes their premature apoptosis. Secretion of outer membrane vesicles that contain different virulence-related proteins (proteases, phospholipases, superoxide dismutase, and catalase) at the infection site accelerates the local innate immune response and ultimately leads to tissue damage. The outer membrane vesicles also augment biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces. Polysaccharide capsule of Gram-negative rods is notorious as a virulence factor. It plays a central role in guarding bacteria against phagocytosis by the host innate immune system. Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of A. baumannii consist of an O-antigen, the carbohydrate core, and a lipid A moiety. LPS is a chemotactic agent that recruits inflammatory cells and compels them to release their cytotoxic material. Quorum sensing is the capability of bacteria to communicate with their neighboring counterparts to respond jointly to the changing environment. They produce small easily diffusible hormone-like molecules known as autoinducers, which are used to observe their population density and to adapt in an ever-changing environment. Like other Gram-negative rods, Acinetobacter yields acylhomoserine lactones as signaling molecules for interspecies and intraspecies communication. It also produces less-studied signaling molecules such as diketopiperazines, 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone, and retention factor 1. Despite the abundance of iron in biological systems, availability of biologically active ferric iron is relatively low due to its decreased solubility in an aerobic environment and chelation by other compounds such as hemoglobin and ferric-binding protein called transferrin. A. baumannii is unable to acquire iron from transferrin or lactoferrin; however, it possesses siderophores, which have iron acquisition ability devoted to iron accumulation from heme. The ability of A. baumannii to form biofilms on biotic and abiotic surfaces is a well-studied mechanism of resistance. To survive in unfavorable conditions, it becomes metabolically inert in the deeper layers of biofilms. Poor penetration and the inability of antibiotics to act on metabolically inert bacteria augment its virulence. A. baumannii involved in epidemics shows a high-level desiccation resistance and biofilm-forming capability on biological surfaces. The property of A. baumannii to form pellicle by virtue of polysaccharide, poly-N-acetyl glucosamine, and csuA\/B usher protein is a way to offshore antibiotic effect. Other virulence factors are also involved in biofilm evolution, including biofilm-associated protein (BAP), OmpA, BAP-like protein-1 (BLP-1), and BAP-like protein-2 (BLP-2). Discovery of antibiotics was a remarkable milestone in the history of modern medicine. The discovery of penicillin, followed by sulfonamides and aminoglycosides, urged scientists to speculate that a \u201cmagic bullet\u201d to wipe out the infectious diseases has been found. However, unfortunately, the scenario is not as true as once thought. Fleming stated in his Nobel lecture that, in future, antibiotics will be easily available to everyone and quacks might undermine the positive role of antibiotics through exposing a persistent low regimen to bacteria that can result in the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Penicillin was administered for the first time in 1941, and penicillin-resistant isolates were detected in 1942. Similarly, methicillin was introduced in 1960 and methicillin-resistant strains were reported in 1961 and so on. Currently, the isolates of A. baumannii resistant to all available antimicrobials have been reported. The hard work of scientific community resulted in discovery of many antibiotics, but their misuse resulted in high degree of resistance. It can be said that pre-antibiotic era has started, where again microbes with greater killing capacity are in abundance. Acinetobacter has been endowed with the genetic setup for rapid development of antimicrobial resistance, and therefore, is known as a natural transformant. Scientific literature is full of reports stating it as one of the toughest bacteria. Until early 1970s, Acinetobacter infections were treatable with ampicillin, carbenicillin, gentamicin, and nalidixic acid, either as a monotherapy or combination therapy, but high rates of resistance were noticed after 1975. Presently, many valuable drugs such as ureidopenicillin, aminopenicillins, narrow-spectrum and even extended-spectrum cephalosporin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, cephamycins such as cefoxitin, and most aminoglycosides have lost their efficacy against Acinetobacter. Carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem), amino-glycosides (amikacin and tobramycin), fluoroquinolones, (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), broad-spectrum cephalosporins (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefepime), and combinations of beta-lactamase inhibitors with antibiotic (ampicillin\/sulbactam) are currently being used, provided that the organisms are susceptible; however, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) have substantially increased."}]},{"title":"Acinetobacter baumannii: emergence of a successful pathogen","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can A. baumannii cause?","id":"65-4-1-1","answers":[{"text":"hospital-acquired pneumonia","answer_start":1101,"id":1},{"text":"infections involving the central nervous system, skin and soft tissue, and bone","answer_start":1220,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are A. baumannii resistant to?","id":"65-4-1-2","answers":[{"text":"all known antibiotics","answer_start":520,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"The genus known as Acinetobacter has undergone significant taxonomic modification over the last 30 years. Its most important representative, Acinetobacter baumannii, has emerged as one of the most troublesome pathogens for health care institutions globally. Its clinical significance, especially over the last 15 years, has been propelled by its remarkable ability to upregulate or acquire resistance determinants, making it one of the organisms threatening the current antibiotic era. A. baumannii strains resistant to all known antibiotics have now been reported, signifying a sentinel event that should be acted on promptly by the international health care community. Acting in synergy with this emerging resistance profile is the uncanny ability of A. baumannii to survive for prolonged periods throughout a hospital environment, thus potentiating its ability for nosocomial spread. The organism commonly targets the most vulnerable hospitalized patients, those who are critically ill with breaches in skin integrity and airway protection. As reported from reviews dating back to the 1970s (199), hospital-acquired pneumonia is still the most common infection caused by this organism. However, in more recent times, infections involving the central nervous system, skin and soft tissue, and bone have emerged as highly problematic for certain institutions. Interest in Acinetobacter, from both the scientific and public community, has risen sharply over recent years. Significant advances have been made in our understanding of this fascinating organism since it was last reviewed in this journal in 1996 (28). In the present review, we describe these advances and also provide a comprehensive appraisal of the relevant microbiological, clinical, and epidemiological characteristics of A. baumannii, the most clinically relevant species.

With the advent of whole-genome sequencing, we have been able to gain important insights into the genetic complexity and agility of this fascinating organism. Its wide array of drug resistance determinants and its ability to effectively regulate these according to selective environmental pressures clearly demand respect. The global epidemiology of A. baumannii is concerning for widespread dissemination, most often in a clonal manner within institutions or cities, and sometimes between countries. The evidence suggests that hospital-acquired A. baumannii infections prolong the lengths of hospital stays and subsequent health care costs. However, the direct effects of A. baumannii on mortality appear less well defined. Despite the majority of A. baumannii strains still being susceptible to carbapenems, many institutions around the world are faced with the challenging issue of pandrug resistance. Concerns have been raised about the use of tigecycline for A. baumannii infection, particularly for bacteremia, leaving colistin as the only therapeutic option for some. It is imperative that future research be directed toward understanding the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the polymyxins in order for clinicians to optimize patient outcomes, minimize adverse effects, and prevent the emergence of secondary resistance. Our understanding of the role of combination therapy for patients with multidrug- or pandrug-resistant A. baumannii infections is also critical. New therapeutics are clearly needed, and we as clinicians, microbiologists, and scientists must think broadly about our approach to antimicrobial drug development, as novel targets will no doubt provide the most reward for our afflicted patients."}]}]},{"species":"Acinetobacter lwoffii","docs":[{"title":"Clinical and microbiological characteristics of bacteremia caused by Acinetobacter lwoffii","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Acinetobacter lwoffii normally exist?","id":"66-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"skin, oropharynx and perineum of healthy individuals","answer_start":272,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Acinetobacter lwoffii cause?","id":"66-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":94,"id":1},{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":373,"id":2},{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":527,"id":3},{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":1230,"id":4}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the clinical features and pathogenic roles of bacteremia caused by Acinetobacter lwoffii during a 4-year period.

This bacterium presents in the normal flora of the oropharynx and skin, which is an important pathogen in nosocomial infections and immunocompromised patients [3]. However, pneumonia, acute gastroenteritis, liver abscess, septicaemia, and endocarditis are reported as cases of community-acquired infections related to A. lwoffii  [3\u20137]. In literature, PD-related peritonitis caused by A. lwoffii has rarely been reported [2, 8, 9]. Huddam et al. documented the fact that community-acquired A. lwoffii peritonitis was successfully treated with early recognition and appropriate antibiotic therapy. On the other hand, one patient with previous A. lwoffii peritonitis had been documented in a review of seven A. baumannii peritonitis cases [8]. Zhang et al. retrospectively analyzed 26 episodes of PD-related Acinetobacter species peritonitis and nine peritonitis episodes associated with A. lwoffii were identified [9].  Acinetobacter species infections tend to occur in patients with chronic diseases as diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal disease, heavy smoking, and excess alcohol consumption [2]. Chao et al. stated that DM and chronic glomerulonephritis are the most common causes of renal disease in the Acinetobacter peritonitis patients [9]. Similarly, our patient had comorbidity as DM, renal disease, and smoking. Galvao et al. proposed that Acinetobacter peritonitis tends to occur within the first 1-2 months following another PD peritonitis episode [2, 10]. In contrast, Chao et al. showed that most Acinetobacter peritonitis did not follow the previous peritonitis after the year of 2000, but there were on average 2 episodes with different pathogen before the Acinetobacter peritonitis [9]. However, there was no preceding peritonitis caused by a different pathogen in our case and this was the patient's first peritonitis episode. It has been reported that A. baumannii may escape the effects of conventional antimicrobial therapy [1]. In contrast, the other Acinetobacter species than A. baumannii are highly susceptible to ciprofloxacin, ampicillin\/sulbactam, gentamicin, tigecycline, and carbapenem [11]. In reviewing literature, Acinetobacter peritonitis was usually treated with early and appropriate antibiotic therapy instead of catheter removal [2, 9]. Similarly, A. lwoffii was sensitive to many antibiotics in our case's antibiogram and we treated the patient without necessary Tenckhoff catheter removal. There are several therapeutic options for the treatment of antibiotic-susceptible Acinetobacter infections. These are cephalosporin (ceftazidime or cefepime), a combination of beta-lactam\/beta-lactamase inhibitor, or a carbapenem (imipenem, meropenem, or doripenem). For the resistant isolates, therapeutic options are polymyxins and tigecycline. We continued treatment with piperacillin\/tazobactam due to good response to treatment. According to our best knowledge, there is no clue for the optimal treatment period for A. lwoffii peritonitis.

In the present study, the names Acinetobacter bereziniae sp. nov. and Acinetobacter guillouiae sp. nov., respectively, are proposed for these genomic species based on the congruence of results of polyphasic analysis of 33 strains (16 and 17 strains of genomic species 10 and 11, respectively). All strains were investigated by selective restriction fragment amplification (i.e. AFLP) analysis rpoB sequence analysis, amplified rDNA restriction analysis and tDNA intergenic length polymorphism analysis, and their nutritional and physiological properties were determined. Subsets of the strains were studied by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS or had been classified previously by DNA-DNA reassociation. Results indicate that A. bereziniae and A. guillouiae represent two phenetically and phylogenetically distinct groups within the genus Acinetobacter. Based on the comparative analysis of housekeeping genes (16S rRNA and rpoB genes), these species together represent a monophyletic branch within the genus. Despite their overall phenotypic similarity, the ability to oxidize d-glucose and to grow at 38 degrees C can be used in the presumptive differentiation of these two species from each other: with the exception of three strains that were positive for only one test, A. bereziniae strains were positive for both tests, whereas A. guillouiae strains were negative in these tests. The strains of A. bereziniae originated mainly from human clinical specimens, whereas A. guillouiae strains were isolated from different environmental sources in addition to human specimens. The type strain of A. bereziniae sp. nov. is LMG 1003(T) (=CIP 70.12(T) =ATCC 17924(T)) and that of A. guillouiae sp. nov. is LMG 988(T) (=CIP 63.46( T) =ATCC 11171(T) =CCUG 2491(T)).

Four sets of blood cultures were drawn in parallel from the different catheter lumens and peripheral veins on two consecutive days. Empirical treatment with ceftazidime was started at day 1 of the fever after the first set of cultures.

Relatively few infections caused by Acinetobacter spp. are community-acquired, reported primarily from countries with tropical or subtropical climate, and mainly affected patients with some form of comorbidity or associated with heavy smoking and excess alcohol consumption [7]. Clinical forms of Acinetobacter infections include mainly the respiratory tract, blood-stream infections, peritoneum, urinary tract infection, surgical wounds, meningitis, skin and soft tissue infections and eye infections. The majority of Acinetobacter spp. are A. baumannii, followed by A. lwoffii. A. junii accounts for less than 1% of isolates [8]. Although these infections are mainly attributed to Acinetobacter baumannii as a clinically and epidemiologically most important pathogen of the genus. Other Acinetobacter spp. are also being increasingly recovered from clinical specimens. Acinetobacter spp. raise alarm due to the extent of their antimicrobial resistance which may be exerted against almost all antibiotics currently in use, including the last-line antibiotics like cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and carbapenems. Notably, multi-resistant clinical Acinetobacter isolates other than A. baumannii are being increasingly reported worldwide. In addition to their biochemical properties, isolates are classified into different species based on sequencing of the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene. Acinetobacter junii was first described in 1986 based on biochemical characteristics as a genomic species that were unable to oxidize glucose and able to utilize DL-lactate and L-histidine but not glutarate or azelate [9]. A few strains which were initially classified as A.grimantii were later reclassified as A. junii MTCC 11364 based on genomic sequencing [10]. Few reports on A. junii bacteraemia have been published. A few reports of nosocomial outbreaks caused by A. junii have been described. The first study described an outbreak in a neonatal ICU and IV fat emulsion was implicated as the possible source [11]. The second study described the outbreak in Paediatric Oncology ward and aerators were implicated as the source [12]. A single case report on A. junii bacteremia in an adult immunocompetent patient was also seen [13]. Corneal ulcer and perforation [14,15], peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients [16], meningitis [7] have also been described. Henao-Martinez et al. described a case of community-onset non-traumatic cellulitis caused by a strain identified as A. junii-johnsonii [17]. The largest study on A.junii bacteraemia is a case series of 43 patients in a period of 2000-2009 in Taiwan, most of the described patients had central venous catheters (80%) and almost all of them acquired infection during hospitalization [18]. More than half of cases of A. junii bacteremia were associated with impaired immunity (leukemia\/lymphoma or solid tumors). Three patients in this study had AIDS\/autoimmune disease-causing immunosuppression. A previous study evaluating the clinical characteristics of patients with A. junii infections also reported that this pathogen mainly affected patients who have had prior antimicrobial therapy, invasive procedures or malignancy [4]. There have been case reports of A. junii infection in adult oncology patients as well as post bone marrow transplantation [5,19]. In all studies, the infections primarily manifested as bacteremia in a majority of cases. Although A. junii is capable of causing serious infections, they are generally non-fatal because the micro-organism is commonly susceptible to antimicrobial agents. [11] Clinical presentation with septic shock within a week on A. junii infection has been described as an adverse prognostic factor. Unlike A. baumanii, which is notorious for multidrug resistance, A. junii usually is sensitive to most antibiotics. In a case series, all isolates were susceptible to carbapenem and levofloxacin. More than 95% of the isolates were susceptible to amikacin and ciprofloxacin. Curiously in the same study, the authors noted that over the study period, a significant proportion of strains developed Colistin resistance (35%). Carbapenem-resistant A. junii infections have been recently reported in the literature [20].  Our patient had the perfect setting for A. junii infection. First, the patient had a hospitalization predisposing him to acquire the bacterial infection. We were not able to specifically identify the source. Secondly, he had an immunocompromised state in the setting of steroids, cyclophosphamide and an underlying autoimmune disorder. The strain isolated was susceptible to most antibiotics confirming with the previous studies. The patient never went into clinical shock and clinically improved within a few days of therapy with ciprofloxacin. However, this case is somewhat unique because of the clinical presentation of A. junii bacteremia and cavitary pneumonia in an SLE patient with no previous indwelling venous catheterization."}]}]},{"species":"Acinetobacter parvus","docs":[{"title":"Acinetobacter parvus bacteraemia community-acquired","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Acinetobacter parvus cause?","id":"69-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"bacteraemia","answer_start":252,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Clinicians are generally familiar with Acinetobacter baumannii as an aetiological agent of serious nosocomial infections in intensive care units.

In this 9-year retrospective study, A. ursingii was identified using 16S rRNA and 16S\u201323S rRNA internal transcribed spacer sequence analysis. The performances of the Vitek 2, Phoenix, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer systems for identifying isolates were tested. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to determine the clonality of the isolates. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antimicrobials were determined using the Vitek 2 system.

Patients with A. ursingii bacteremia were also less likely admitted to the intensive care unit than patients with A. baumannii bacteremia (18.8 % vs 63.5 %, p value < 0.01). About half of the patients with A. ursingii (50.8 %) and A. baumannii bacteremia (62.5 %) had received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy within 48 h after bacteremia onset. However, patients with A. ursingii bacteremia had significantly lower 14-day (6.25 % vs 29.8 %, p value = 0.04) and 28-day mortality rates (6.25 % vs 37.3 %, p value = 0.02) than patients with A. baumannii bacteremia. Nine isolates (47.4 %) were correctly identified as A. ursingii and the other 10 isolates (52.6 %) were incorrectly identified as A. lwoffii by the Vitek 2 system. The Phoenix system incorrectly identified all 19 isolates. The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer system correctly identified all 19 isolates.

While Acinetobacter species such as A baumannii, A. nosocomialis, and A. pittii are frequently isolated as human pathogens [6\u201311]; other species, such as A. ursingii, are rarely reported as pathogens [12, 13]. The low incidence of A. ursingii infection may be further complicated by the inaccurate identification tools used in clinical laboratories. In this study, we aimed to describe the incidence and clinical characteristics of A. ursingii bacteremia, the performance of two phenotypic identification systems and one matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer, and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of the isolates. Owing to the predominance of A. baumannii in clinical settings, we also compared the clinical features of A. ursingii and A. baumannii bacteremia."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can A. ursingii cause?","id":"70-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"primary bacteremia","answer_start":1515,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are A. ursingii resistant to?","id":"70-1-3-2","answers":[{"text":"third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins","answer_start":3246,"id":1},{"text":"imipenem, levofloxacin, amikacin, gentamicin, and colistin","answer_start":3458,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Acinetobacter ursingii is a rare pathogen that mostly causes bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies. In this study, most cases were of primary bacteremia, and patients had milder disease severity and underwent fewer invasive procedures than patients with A. baumannii bacteremia. Although more than half of the patients with A. ursingii and A. baumannii bacteremia had undergone inappropriate antimicrobial therapy within 48 h of the onset of bacteremia, the 14-day and 28-day mortality rates of patients with A. ursingii bacteremia were significantly lower than those of patients with A. baumannii bacteremia. As in previous studies [12, 22], a low incidence of A. ursingii bacteremia was noted in our study (1.5\u20135.2 % during the study period). Compared to the risk factors and clinical characteristics of patients with A. baumannii bacteremia, patients with A. ursingii bacteremia are believed to be more immunosuppressed than patients with A. baumannii bacteremia, due to the higher concurrence rate in patients with hematologic malignancy, neutropenia, and chemotherapy treatment. Compared to the condition of patients with A. baumannii bacteremia, that of patients with A. ursingii seemed less severe, as indicated by lower APACHE II scores, fewer ICU admissions and invasive procedures, and lower mortality rates. The results indicated a lower virulence of A. ursingii, and this may account for the lower incidence of A. ursingii bacteremia. It is unclear why most of the A. ursingii cases were primary bacteremia without an obvious source of infection. Among the patients with A. ursingii bacteremia, central venous catheters were placed in 6 patients (37.5 %), arterial catheters in 6 patients (37.5 %), and total parenteral nutrition in 1 patient (6.25 %). One patient (6.25 %) required dialysis and 4 patients (25 %) needed ventilator support at the onset of bacteremia. The intravascular device may serve as a port of entry for A. ursingii bacteremia. Phenotypic schemes are generally insufficient to accurately identify the Acinetobacter isolates at the species level [23\u201325]. Phenotypic identification by commercial colorimetric systems is also unsatisfactory [6, 12, 26, 27]. Using systems such as the Vitek 2, API20NE systems (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l\u2019Etoile, France) and the Phoenix system, the clinically relevant species of the A. calcoaceticus\u2013A. baumannii complex are frequently uniformly identified as A. baumannii, and many other species are not identified [6, 12, 26, 27]. On comparison, the Vitek 2 systems in our study could correctly identify about half of the isolates, and Phoenix systems failed to correctly identify any. Protein fingerprinting using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer is a promising molecular method for rapid identification of Acinetobacter species with high-throughput capability. A previous study revealed a 72.4 % correct identification rate for Acinetobacter species by using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer [28]. The correct rate of A. ursingii identification was 93.3 % in that study. As the database of the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer expanded, 100 % of the A. ursingii isolates were correctly identified in our study. In our study, all the A. ursingii isolates exhibited high resistance to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins. These results suggest the presence of some extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamase, which deserves further study. More than 80 % of the A. ursingii isolates were susceptible to imipenem, levofloxacin, amikacin, gentamicin, and colistin. While comparing the antimicrobial susceptibility of the A. ursingii isolates in our study with the isolates reported by Cattoir in 2006 [12], the resistance rate to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin, and colistin seemed higher. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying antimicrobial resistance."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can A. ursingii cause?","id":"70-1-4-1","answers":[{"text":"primary bacteremia","answer_start":101,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"In conclusion, A. ursingii is a rare pathogen with a low mortality rate.

The skin may become a reservoir for Acinetobacter in hospitalized patients and health care provider [3].

Currently, more than 32 genomic species have been identified by molecular methods [6, 7]. Virulence, epidemiology, antimicrobial susceptibility, clinical significance of Acinetobacter species may vary. Therefore, determining the prevalence of the Acinetobacter species causing invasive infection may be helpful in the management of infection [8, 9]. Risk factors for infection with A. ursingii emerged as noso-comial pathogens during the last 3 decades including underlying serious disease such as cancer, intravascular catheterization, treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics, prolonged hospitalization. Due to their ability for long-term survival in the environment, A. ursingii may spread among patients and cause nosocomial infections and outbreaks. Although A. ursingii have low pathogenic potential, it has increasingly been described as opportunistic pathogen particularly in immunosupressed and patients in intensive care units [10]. Acinetobacter may cause suppurative infection such as peritonitis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, arthritis, pancreatic and liver abcesses. Clinical manifestations are similar to other bacterial infections and may vary depending on the serious underlying disease and immune status. A. ursingii related bloodstream infection may occur as primary or secondary to respiratory or urinary tract and wound infection. Immunosupressed neonates are at particularly high risk for primary bacteremia, and clinical signs may vary ranging from an asymptomatic to septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Because of increasing antibiotic resistance, treatment of infections due to Acinetobacter spp. has become difficult. Antibiotic treatment should be determined by in vitro susceptibility testing. A. ursingii seems to be more susceptible to antimicrobial agents compared to A. baumannii. Infections due to A. ursingii are rare in healthy children. There are a few reports of infection with A. ursingii in the literature; most of the cases are immunocompromised with underlying serious disease.

The clinically important species in this genus are Acinetobacter pittii, Acinetobacter nosocomialis, and Acinetobacter baumannii, with the last being the most important epidemiologically and frequently isolated from the intensive care unit (ICU), causing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, bacteremia, urinary tract infection, meningitis, and wound infection (Dexter et al., 2015; Wong et al., 2017). The Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex (Acb) harbored six species: A. calcoaceticus, A. baumannii, A. pittii, A. nosocomialis, Acinetobacter seifertii, and Acinetobacter dijkshoorniae (Gerner-Smidt et al., 1991; Nemec et al., 2011, 2015). The Acb complex cause hospital-acquired pneumonia and bacteremia in critically ill or immunocompromised patients (Wong et al., 2017; Vazquez and Kollef, 2018). The species of the complex are phenotypically indistinguishable and molecular methods are required for its correct identification (Gerner-Smidt et al., 1991). The participation of A. calcoaceticus in clinical infections remains unclear compared with other species, in which clinical importance has been demonstrated (Peleg et al., 2008; Nemec et al., 2015; Cosgaya et al., 2016). A. baumannii is one of the most difficult bacteria to contain in a hospital environment. Additionally, it is included in the list of priority pathogens resistant to antibiotics, owing to the resistance it has acquired to different antibiotics such as carbapenems and cephalosporins limiting the therapeutic options for the treatment of infections caused by this pathogen (Higgins et al., 2010; Shrivastava et al., 2018). The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) methods have been used to type clinical strains of A. baumanni (Limansky et al., 2004; Rafei et al., 2014). In hospitals in Spain and Germany, a total of 20 allelic profiles or sequence types (STs) were identified through MLST, and these results agreed with those generated by PFGE, suggesting MLST as a tool for the molecular epidemiological study of clinical strains of A. baumannii (Bartual et al., 2005). However, there are other studies where according to the tool used, the typing of the strains differs completely; the relationships between clinical isolates that were determined through PFGE revealed that isolates were not closely related (Evans et al., 2008). Through nucleotide analysis of the blaOXA-51 gene sequence, two closely related groups were identified. The sequencing of the blaOXA-51 gene, being only one genetic element, yielded a less-defined clonal relationship than PFGE analyses, where the whole genome is digested and analyzed to establish whether there is a clonal relationship between the strains under study (Evans et al., 2008). The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas system has been proposed for typing bacterial strains. Two CRISPR-Cas systems have been identified in strains of A. baumannii from military and children\u2019s hospitals. An analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the CRISPR-Cas systems (CRISPR-AYE and Acinetobacter baylyi ADP systems) grouped the isolates into two clonal complexes and provided information about the evolution of these complexes (Hauck et al., 2012). At the same time, the CRISPR-Cas I-Fb system has been proposed for the subtyping of strains (Karah et al., 2015). Genome sequencing is used to characterize and establish genetic relationships among isolates. Clinical strains identified as Acb complex were typed using PFGE, MLST, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses. SNP analysis was more discriminatory than those obtained by PFGE and MLST for the identification of clones and their association with outbreaks (Fitzpatrick et al., 2016).  A. baumannii mortality is approximately 14.5% and it has been associated with HAIs in tertiary level hospitals in Mexico (Bocanegra-Ibarias et al., 2015). Furthermore, the Mexican strains that have been characterized are distinguished by their resistance to imipenem and meropenem, as well as being associated with the amplification of carbapenemases such as OXA-23, OXA-239, and OXA-58. An epidemiological aspect of relevance is the different STs distributed among Mexican hospitals, belonging to clonal complexes 636 and 92, presenting ST208, ST369, and ST758 (Alc\u00e1ntar-Curiel et al., 2014; Tamayo-Legorreta et al., 2014; Gonzalez-Villoria et al., 2016). However, information about other species related to the Acb complex has not been available. The Acb complex poses a major challenge to this genus, suggesting a very recent diversification of those species, and events of homologous recombination can probably be contributed to a homogenous gene composition (Mateo-Estrada et al., 2019). The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of isolation of the species that constitute the Acb complex, as well as the susceptibility to antibiotics, and their distribution at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez (HIMFG). To achieve this aim, the Acinetobacter species were distinguished when the strains were identified as the Acb complex using a collection of 88 strains from 52 children from 07, January 2015 to 28, September 2017, previously identified as the A. baumannii and Acb complex. Then, after the susceptibility profile was determined, four of the most frequent blaOXA genes were detected, the plasmid profile, pulsotype, and sequence type were established and the CRISPR-Cas system was carried out for all strains."}]}]},{"species":"Alloprevotella tannerae","docs":[{"title":"Description of Alloprevotella rava gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity, and reclassification of Prevotella tannerae Moore et al. 1994 as Alloprevotella tannerae gen. nov., comb. nov","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Alloprevotella tannerae is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"73-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-negative","answer_start":28,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Alloprevotella tannerae normally exist?","id":"73-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"human oral cavity","answer_start":68,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Alloprevotella tannerae's requirement for oxygen?","id":"73-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"anaerobic","answer_start":17,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Alloprevotella tannerae?","id":"73-1-1-4","answers":[{"text":"bacilli","answer_start":42,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Five strains of anaerobic, gram-negative bacilli isolated from the human oral cavity were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests and were found to comprise a homogeneous group.

In 1992 it was reclassified as A. parvulum [2]. A. parvulum is of high interest because it has frequently been isolated from the human oral cavity, especially from the tongue dorsum, where it has been associated with patients suffering from halitosis (oral malodor) [3,4]. In general, the malodorous compounds are volatile sulfur compounds, with the most frequent ones being hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, and dimethyl sulfide, which are produced by bacterial metabolism of the sulfur containing amino acids cysteine and methionine [3,4]. However, for A. parvulum itself, the production of these substances has not yet been studied.

With this in mind, our case provides a unique account because Burkholderia multivorans has never been reported as a specific cause of bacterial meningitis. Although reports of BCC meningitis exist [[11], [12], [13]], isolates were never identified to the species level as seen with our patient. The identification of the BCC species is usually difficult due to the phenotypic and genotypic similarities among them and other Burkholderia species outside of the BCC [3]. In our patient, Burkholderia multivorans was initially identified using the VITEK MS system in our facility and confirmed at the state reference laboratory. Multiple risk factors including MM-associated immunosuppression, maintenance chemotherapy, extensive healthcare exposure, and prolonged use of a central venous catheter ultimately led to our patient\u2019s likely acquisition of this Burkholderia multivorans infection. Patients with MM have abnormalities in both cellular and humoral immunity that increase the risk of infection. Those defects include hypogammaglobulinemia, low number and anomalous function of dendritic and T cells, abnormal Th1\/Th2 CD4 ratio, disruption of T cell diversity, and dysfunction of natural killer cells [[14], [15]]. MM treatment also increases the risk for infections, cytopenias, and thrombotic events [[16], [17], [18], [19]]. These complications are underscored in this case by the patient developing pneumonia, DVT, CLABSI, and meningitis after receiving maintenance chemotherapy with carfilzomib, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone. The patient spent several weeks in different healthcare facilities, increasing the exposure risk to nosocomial pathogens. The prolonged use of a central venous catheter was likely the port of entry for Burkholderia multivorans and consequently led to the patient\u2019s CLABSI and meningitis. BCC management is challenging due to its ability to evade the action of multiple antimicrobials through intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms [[2], [5]]. Those mechanisms include the production of \u03b2-lactamases, carbapenemases, and antibacterial drug efflux pumps as well as the ability to decrease the number of membrane porins, modify bacterial lipopolysaccharide structure, and mutate antimicrobial binding targets [2]. Although these resistance mechanisms have limited our antimicrobial armamentarium against BCC infections, certain isolates can show susceptibility to beta-lactams including ceftazidime, meropenem, and piperacillin. These medications are considered alternatives to TMP\/SMX, the primary regimen for therapy and prophylaxis of BCC infections. Moreover, beta-lactams can be used as a treatment option when patients have an intolerance, allergy, or resistance to TMP\/SMX [5]. In this case, only TMP\/SMX showed activity against the isolate which confirms the resilience of Burkholderia multivorans to therapy and supports TMP\/SMX as an effective option to treat Burkholderia multivorans infections including meningitis [[11], [20]].

There are also reports that Burkholderia lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a factor which induces plant defensive capacity [5]. Burkholderia cenocepacia is a multidrug resistant, opportunistic pathogen. B. cenocepacia belongs to the Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC), a group of 21 species of opportunistic pathogens that colonizes patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) [6]. Although, BCC representatives are responsible for only 3.5% of infections in CF patients, the fatality rate is higher than in the more commonly acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection [7]. Following colonization of the host by BCC, the likelihood of complete eradication is very low. The course of infection differs depending on the CF status and may range from asymptomatic to severe inflammation of the lower respiratory tract, leading to lung function decline and ultimately to the patient\u2019s death. Twenty percent of infected individuals develop \u201ccepacia syndrome\u201d, characterized by a high fever, pneumonia and severe bacteraemia [8]. Treatment is hindered by the pathogen\u2019s inherent antimicrobial drug resistance, including insensitivity to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and \u03b2-lactams [9]. Further, BCC bacteria are highly resistant to antimicrobial peptides and even has the ability to use penicillin G as a carbon source. BCC may form biofilms, further enhancing their resistance to antibiotics [10,11]. The mechanisms of BCC pathogenicity are multifactorial and complex. Because of that, finding solid strategies to combat infections caused by these bacteria is very challenging [12]. There are several known virulence mechanisms that have been reported to date: (i) invasion of epithelial cells and access to the bloodstream; (ii) structures responsible for adhesion (pili, flagella); (iii) LPS specific to Gram-negative bacteria; (iv) secretion systems (types I\u2013IV); (v) biofilm formation; (vi) toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems; (vii) quorum sensing (QS) systems regulating expression of multiple virulence factors (e.g., toxins, proteases, lipases); and (viii) drug-resistance [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]. Of all the listed BCC virulence factors, only TA systems were described previously as encoded by prophages [21]. The genetic material of prophages is replicated by bacteria during its division, resulting in mutual benefits for the virus and its host. In addition, prophages can contribute to the enhancement of environment survival of infected cells by transferring genes which allow the exploitation of new nutrient sources and encode specific enzymes and toxins. Further, bacteriophages play a key role in the diversification of bacteria by immunizing their hosts against homologous viruses. All these factors can influence the survival of strains and changes in the composition of populations prevailing in a given environment. The process of gene donation by phages to the hosts is defined as lysogenic conversion [22]. It is suspected that prophages equip bacteria with toxins and enzymes, allowing their hosts to invade higher organisms and avoid the immune response and ultimately leading to increased pathogenicity of the bacteria [23]. Lysogenic conversion also plays an important role in transmitting antibiotic resistance. Such phenomenon was described for Streptococcus-specific phages transferring drug-resistance to chloramphenicol, macrolides, lincomycin and clindamycin [24]. Prophages can comprise a significant component of bacterial genetic material. In Escherichia coli O157 and Streptococcus pyogenes M3 MGAS 315, prophages account for up to 12% of the chromosomal DNA. In bacteria with smaller genomes, such as Borrelia burgdorferi, prophages exist as linear or circular episomes (plasmids). B. burgdorferi B31 is a particular example of such pseudolysogeny, as the episomal temperate phages may make up to 20% of its total genome [25]. It was assumed that this is caused by the evolutionary pressure of bacteria, which manifests in the removal of unessential DNA from its chromosome, maintaining the genome size at a particularly reduced level [26]. Bacteria hosting certain prophage may conduct a bacteriophage \u201cdomestication\u201d process. This phenomenon is based on the modification of genetic material present in the cell, including nonsynonymous substitutions of nucleotides or deletions of whole genes (or regions). This leads to a partial or total disorder of the phage life cycle inhibiting prophage induction and lytic form of propagation. Overall, \u201cdomestication\u201d results in the progressive removal of prophage genetic material, leaving only those sequences which are essential for bacteria. In most cases, these entities are referred to as cryptic phages. Once the phage DNA is just limited to individual genes or incomplete regions, it is referred to as a bacteriophage artifact [25]. The remaining phage regions may undergo further recombination with other prophages, plasmids and gene clusters which were already present within bacterial genome [27,28]. To date, there are 39 sequenced BCC phages in the NCBI database and two additional phage, phiK96243 and \u03d5H111-1, not in the database (Table S1). Phage phiK96243 and \u03d5H111-1 were described but their sequences were not submitted to any database as standalone sequence [21,29]. Twenty-three phages possess either integrase or recombinase (suggesting their temperate lifestyle) however only fourteen were labeled as temperate in the literature. Six of remaining phages are lytic, while 19 are unclassified. The taxonomical division places 19 phages in Myoviridae, 10 in Podoviridae and nine in Siphoviridae. The phiK96243 has not yet been classified. In this study we analyzed 16 B. cenocepacia strains with fully sequenced genomes stored in the NCBI database. The main goals were to search for the presence and prevalence of prophages and their gene composition. Further, phage accumulation in particular chromosomes, location site (integration point), and closest neighborhood (flanking sequences) were also investigated. The occurrence of known virulence factors of B. cenocepacia was examined to determine if they were any of phage origin. All identified prophages were compared phylogenetically, to establish their taxonomic relationship. The analysis was done by in silico methods, based on two different approaches, one fully automatic and one manual approach to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of both techniques."}]},{"title":"Burkholderia cenocepacia keratitis","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Burkholderia cenocepacia is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"82-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-negative","answer_start":102,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) is a ubiquitous group of oxidase producing, lactose nonfermenting, gram-negative bacteria composed of 24 closely related species as of now, but due to rapid mutagenic capability of the organism, many more species may emerge.[8] Majority of keratitis cases reported have been due to Burkholderia cepacia.[1,2,3,4,5,6] This organism has an intrinsic capacity to survive in various pharmaceutical products causing nosocomial outbreaks attributed to its inherent resistance to antibiotics and antiseptics. Other virulence factors include complex metabolic pathways, survival at a wide range of temperatures from 18 to 42\u00b0C, biofilm formation, etc., which allow survival in various adverse environmental conditions.[8] Therefore, even a single case should alert the clinician to take prompt action to prevent spread of infection. Phenotypic identification of BCC members is a tedious procedure and, for most, biochemical distinctions not possible.[9] Among automated systems, MALDI-TOF- MS plays an important role in identifying BCC members. It works on the principle of mass spectrometry where identification is made by comparing peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) of unknown organisms with PMF in the system database, with studies showing good concordance to sequencing.[7] Identification of organisms is very rapid (within 20 min), which aids in instituting appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Our patient reported trauma and contamination with infected soiled water from cement-mix at a construction site. Additionally, she had been using topical steroids on a long-term basis, which compromised immunity of the ocular surface. Pharmaceutical contamination could be a possible source of infection, though we did not culture the steroid eyedrop that she was using. Had we done so and isolated the bacteria, it may have been identified as a possible source of the infection. In our case, it is more likely that the foreign body trauma was the source of infection due to a clear temporal association of trauma and onset of symptoms over the following week. There are few reports of keratitis due to BCC following trauma.[4,6] Chaurasia et al. reported four cases of keratitis with BCC, of whom two cases were post-trauma, and one was on topical steroids.[4] Keratitis has also been reported with contact lens use, following cataract surgery and LASIK.[2,3,5,6] In immunocompetent individuals, it has been reported as chronic, indolent ulcers.[10] Most reported good healing following appropriate identification and treatment. Unlike most other species of BCC, the strain we cultured was susceptible to most drugs with clinical improvement on moxifloxacin 0.5% eyedrops. There are few cases of infectious keratitis reported with Burkholderia spp., and it was first reported by Levy et al., in a postkeratoplasty patient using contact lenses in 1985.[1] This was prior to its classification as Burkholderia spp, and it was reported as Pseudomonas cepacia. Before MALDI era, the Burkholderia genus itself was misidentified because oxidase positive nonfermenters were considered to be Pseudomonas species by most microbiologists. Conventional methods of Burkholderia species identification are laborious and usually not undertaken. This could be the possible reason for underreporting of cases."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Burkholderia cenocepacia cause?","id":"82-3-2-1","answers":[{"text":"keratitis","answer_start":208,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Burkholderiaspp should be considered in keratitis, especially in patients whose ocular surface immunity may be compromised due to topical steroids.

It can infect cystic fibrosis (CF) patients causing a severe decline in lung function which can further develop into a life-threatening systemic infection known as cepacia syndrome. CF is the commonest autosomal recessive disease in Europe affecting 1 in 2500 newborns, nevertheless it is considered rare according to the European Union definition (i.e., disease affecting less than five individuals per 10,000 people) (Farrell, 2008). More than 2,000 mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene are responsible for the disease. The CFTR encodes a chloride ion channel which is expressed on the surface of cells in many tissues, including lungs, gut, and pancreas; its malfunctioning causes the production of viscous secretions which are particularly dangerous in the lungs where opportunistic infections consequently occur (Knowles and Durie, 2002). It is noteworthy, that chronic respiratory infections and inflammation are the leading cause of death in CF (Ciofu et al., 2013). Moreover, colonization of immunocompromised individuals has also been reported (Ganesan and Sajjan, 2012). Bcc bacteria, particularly B. cenocepacia, are naturally resistant to different classes of antibiotics used in clinical practice (Mahenthiralingam et al., 2005; Burns, 2007) and their pathogenicity is promoted by several virulence determinants (Loutet and Valvano, 2010; Sousa et al., 2011). These characteristics, together with the ability to adapt to environmental changes, make the treatment of B. cenocepacia infections particularly challenging. In fact, it has been shown that during long-term colonization, B. cenocepacia can undergo transcriptional reprogramming in response to host immune response, antimicrobial therapy, nutrient availability, and oxygen limitation (Mira et al., 2011). Consequently, a genomic approach as well as the construction of mutant libraries revealed crucial in identifying essential genes responsible for antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and adaptation (Wong et al., 2016; Gislason et al., 2017). From an epidemiological perspective, a recent study by Salsgiver et al. (2016) reported that from 1995 to 2012 the prevalence of Bcc infections decreased from 3.6 to 3.0% in the United States (Salsgiver et al., 2016). This was ascribed to the combination of new antimicrobial therapies with CFTR correctors and potentiators, as well as the introduction of new guidelines detailing prevention and eradication strategies (Saiman et al., 2014). Although Burkholderia species are relatively rare amongst CF patients, they still cause serious challenges. Indeed, despite therapeutic advances, respiratory failure remains the major cause of premature death and lung transplant the best option to treat the most severe cases (Ramos et al., 2017). However, a main post-transplant complication is represented by infection with multidrug resistant bacteria and Bcc was recognized as a significant contributor to CF morbidity and mortality associated to increased post-transplant death rate (Alexander et al., 2008; Chaparro and Keshavjee, 2016). In this context, studying the resistance profile, the mechanisms underlying resistance, as well as the epidemiology of CF pathogens seems essential to improve management of these infections. In this review, we describe the clinical distribution of B. cenocepacia resistant strains reported in the last 6 years and the methods for identification and classification of epidemic strains. All together these data point out the urgent need of new and alternative therapies to treat Bcc infections and improve CF patients\u2019 life quality and expectancy. Finally, we summarize new antibiotics, clinical trials, and alternative approaches reported in the literature in the last 5 years to tackle B. cenocepacia resistance to antimicrobials."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can B. cenocepacia cause?","id":"82-5-3-1","answers":[{"text":"cepacia syndrome","answer_start":301,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Even if the epidemiology of CF pathogens is continuously changing and B. cenocepacia is not one of the prevalent bacteria colonizing the lung of patients, it still remains a major threat due to its extreme resistance to antibiotics and its ability to cause a life-threatening CF complication known as cepacia syndrome. In the last years, several studies were aimed at deciphering the principal mechanisms of resistance in Burkholderia, however, many aspects have not yet been fully understood. This has important repercussions on the choice of antibacterial drugs to be used and on our knowledge of the physiology of a bacterium with a wide genome yet to be fully explored. The lack of a standard therapy regimen makes the treatment of Bcc infections challenging and more studies are needed to improve survival and quality of life of CF patients. On the contrary, evidence-based eradication guidelines are available for P. aeruginosa allowing standardization of antimicrobial treatment and hence improving management of these infections (Mogayzel et al., 2014). The introduction of correctors and potentiators of the CFTR defects requires more studies of drug-drug interactions to predict treatment efficacy, however, this is not possible while a standard therapy for Bcc is not available. Since few patients are infected by B. cenocepacia, an increased effort to coordinate clinical trials and observational studies among different hospitals is needed, maximizing data necessary to standardize methods for evaluation of antibiotic susceptibility. Since the development of new drugs is not trivial, it is necessary to improve the use of existing therapies while coordinating trials of new molecules which showed their potential in vitro and in animal models."}]}]},{"species":"Burkholderia cepacia","docs":[{"title":"Outbreak of Burkholderia Cepacia Infection: a Systematic Study in a Hematolooncology Unit of a Tertiary Care Hospital from Eastern India","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Burkholderia cepacia is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"83-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-negative","answer_start":33,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Burkholderia cepacia normally exist?","id":"83-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"fluids used in the hospital ward","answer_start":84,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Burkholderia cepacia?","id":"83-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":203,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Burkholderia cepacia sensitive to?","id":"83-1-1-4","answers":[{"text":"pipercillin+tazobactum, cefoperazone+sulbactum, fluoroquinolones, cotrimoxazole and carbapenems","answer_start":1265,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Burkholderia cepacia resistant to?","id":"83-1-1-5","answers":[{"text":"most of the antibiotics in hospitalized patients","answer_start":293,"id":1},{"text":"polymyxin B and colistin","answer_start":1379,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Burkholderia cepacia's requirement for oxygen?","id":"83-1-1-6","answers":[{"text":"aerobic","answer_start":25,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Burkholderia cepacia?","id":"83-1-1-7","answers":[{"text":"bacillus","answer_start":47,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Burkholderia cepacia, an aerobic gram-negative bacillus, is a frequent colonizer of fluids used in the hospital ward.

Such outbreaks are not uncommon. Fever with chills and rigor was the universal manifestation in all episodes as initial presentation. In a recent study in febrile neutropenia with hematological malignancy done by Mandal PK et al from eastern part of India showed that, eight commonest isolates are Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.10 %), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA-12.82 %), Acinetobacter species (11.53 %), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (10.25 %), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.97 %), Escherichia coli (8.97 %), ESBL E. coli (6.41 %), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA-6.41 %). B. cepacia is a gram-negative organism and is a common infection in patients with cystic fibrosis with lung involvement or chronic granulomatous disease, usually due to contamination of medical devices or products. Its intrinsic resistance to many disinfectants, antiseptic solutions, and antibiotics makes infection control particularly problematic. Though many reports of Bcc outbreaks are there in intensive care units, hemodialysis clinic, and also oncology departments, but reports regarding hematology patients are few. The very pertinent issues regarding these organisms is that the virulence of sepsis is no different from other gram-negative organism and considering the prolonged hospital stay of our patients the organism may become multi-antibiotic resistant. Moreover Burkholderia outbreak can occur due to the growth of the organism in saline, antiseptic solutions as established by others. Another very interesting fact about B. cepacia infection is that cross-transmission is the very common mode of spread although all the studies are in patients with cystic fibrosis. While investigating an outbreak of B. cepacia bacteremia in a tertiary care center by Abdelfattah R et al., B. cepacia was isolated from the blood cultures of 14 patients resulting from contamination of the gel applied to the ultrasound probe used to guide the insertion of a central venous catheter. Gill JS et al from a tertiary care hospital in India reported 17 cases of cardiac pacemaker pocket infection including multidrug-resistant B. cepacia (n=3) infection and concluded that every hospital should formulate their antibiotic policy based on the pattern of the hospital flora and their drug sensitivity. All possible sources from our ward were cultured, and no other causative source was identified and thus, strengthened our proposal of overnight refrigeration of prepared intravenous antibiotics was a possible cause for the outbreak of B. cepacia. We very meticulously noted the MIC50 and MIC90 values against every antibiotic as per CLSI guidelines. Though other studies showed sensitivity to ceftazidime, but our study showed resistance to this antibiotic including many other cephalosporins as shown in figure 3. As shown in the study by Vardi et al, the organisms had shown resistance to polymyxin B, Imipenem, and aminoglycosides; our study also showed a similar type of resistance to the antibiotics except for imipenem (including all other carbapenems) which had shown excellent sensitivity. All the patients received empirical antibiotics with Cefoperazone-Sulbactum or Piperacillin-Tazobactum and became afebrile within three days of intravenous antibiotic therapy. We didn\u2019t have to escalate to carbapenems in any of our patients. Antibiotics were continued for 10\u201314 days depending on the clinical scenario, and the repeat blood culture report was negative. As shown in table 2, the patients in the study had a mean ANC of 600\/\u03bcl (range: 300\u20132800). Thus, many patients had no neutropenia at the onset of fever. And this signifies that patients may get infected with opportunistic organisms like B. cepacia due to the immune-compromised status related to primary hematological malignancy and\/or chemotherapy, even if the patient may not be in neutropenic phase. When we analyzed our outcome regarding mortality related to this outbreak, it was not disappointing. Only one patient with B. cepacia sepsis suffering from acute myeloid leukemia died of sepsis on day 10 of her chemotherapy with DA 3+7 standard protocol. The death cannot surely be attributed to B. cepacia sepsis as she also had developed possible fungal pneumonia with multi-organ failure. We work in a tertiary care university hospital with hematology-oncology care facility catering to people of low socio-economic status, mostly. Due to obvious reasons, there are many resource constraints such as- provision\/facility of no separate room for the patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy, multiple beds in a single room with very little inter-bed distance, common toilet facility, very low nurse-patient ratio. On trying to search for the possible cause of this outbreak, it was suddenly discovered that the health care providers used to reconstitute the intravenous antibiotics and store them in the syringes late at night in anticipation of administration of the drug on the next morning. The reconstituted antibiotics used to be stored in the refrigerator. Since Bcc is an organism with a capacity to grow in antiseptic solutions, it might have grown in prepared antibiotic solutions. So we hypothesized that this practice could have precipitated the Bcc outbreak. In our urgency to save the lives of the patients, the practice was immediately discontinued, and the intervention resulted in the incidence coming down sharply from 48% to 9% in the next three months (Figure 3). On hindsight, we realized that in our enthusiasm to act fast, we had not sent the suspected fluid for culture and sensitivity. And, we successfully managed to control the propagation of this outbreak further by changing our antibiotic preparation practice."}]},{"title":"Clinico-microbiological profile of Burkholderia cepacia keratitis: a case series","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can B. cepacia cause?","id":"83-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"keratitis","answer_start":233,"id":1},{"text":"keratitis","answer_start":357,"id":2},{"text":"keratitis","answer_start":549,"id":3},{"text":"keratitis","answer_start":669,"id":4},{"text":"keratitis","answer_start":1091,"id":5}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Burkholderia cepacia?","id":"83-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":25,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are B. cepacia sensitive to?","id":"83-2-1-3","answers":[{"text":"ceftazidime or fluoroquinolones","answer_start":1215,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Burkholderia cepacia, an opportunistic pathogen mainly affecting patients with cystic fibrosis or immunocompromised, has rarely been documented as a cause of corneal infection.

B. cepacia accounted for 0.51% (5\/875) of microbial keratitis cases in our previous ten-year (2003\u20132012) study [11], but we identified 12 more cases in recent years. To our best knowledge, this study is by far the largest case series related to B. cepacia keratitis. In conjunction with previously reported cases, we provided a more detailed overview of the clinical characteristics of B. cepacia keratitis.

Matoba et al. also presented a patient with herpetic stroma keratitis, under oral acyclovir and topical prednisolone acetate treatment, who developed polymicrobial keratitis including B. ambifaria (belonging to the B. cepacia complex), Enterococcus spp., and Staphylococcus aureus [7]. Infection with herpes virus might cause sub-basal nerve damage of the cornea [12, 13]. The impaired corneal sensory innervation leads to a reduction of protective reflexes and trophic neuromodulators, which affect the wound-healing function of the cornea [14], making its surface an easy target for opportunistic bacteria such as B. cepacia. In addition, if the local immune response has been suppressed by topical steroids, a herpetic corneal ulcer can predispose microbial adherence, furthering the infection. Recent ocular surgery with simultaneous topical steroid use was noted in three of the previously reported eight patients with B. cepacia keratitis and two patients in our study (Tables 1 and \u200band2),2), suggesting that local immunosuppression may play a role in such an opportunistic infection. In our study, approximately 40% of B. cepacia culture-positive corneal scrapings were polymicrobial, as were two (25%) of the previously reported eight cases (Table 2). These mixed infections might be due to direct inoculation because of a corneal injury, contamination through the process of corneal scraping, or opportunistic transmission in these immunocompromised patients [15]. Tuft et al. proposed a synergy effect of interactions between organisms in polymicrobial infection [16] and speculated that the primary organism may create a niche, either by providing a sequestered environment or by supplying specific metabolic requirements for a second organism, that predisposes the host to further infection or turns a normally nonpathogenic organism into a pathogen. The mixed infections might modulate the clinical course of the disease, causing unexpected treatment effects. B. cepacia demonstrates multidrug resistance, including resistance to carboxypenicillins, polymyxins, and aminoglycosides. Nevertheless, sulfamethoxazole\u2013trimethoprim, ceftazidime, and meropenem have been revealed to be the most effective agents on the basis of in vitro susceptibility data, which agrees with our drug susceptibility test results [17]. We did not test for susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, the most popular empiric antibiotic in the field of ophthalmology. Chaurasia et al. performed an antibiotic susceptibility test for four B. cepacia isolated from keratitis and reported 100% susceptibility to ceftazidime and 50% susceptibility to ciprofloxacin\/norfloxacin [4]. In the case report by Reddy et al. the isolate from the patient with B. cepacia keratitis was resistant to moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, tobramycin, and ceftazidime and susceptible only to sulfamethoxazole\u2013trimethoprim in vitro; nevertheless, in vivo, the ulcer resolved completely after tobramycin and gatifloxacin treatment (Table 2) [9]. The other three isolates from previously reported B. cepacia keratitis cases were susceptible to ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin [5, 7, 18]. On the basis of the antibiotic susceptibility and clinical results of the patients with B. cepacia keratitis (Tables 1 and \u200band2),2), fluoroquinolones could be initiated as empiric antibiotics. However, if fluoroquinolone use does not improve the clinical course, ceftazidime may be a suitable alternative. Even after aggressive medical treatment, about one-third of the patients in our study and two (25%) of the previously reported eight B. cepacia keratitis cases required surgical interventions (Tables 1 and \u200band22). The visual outcome of B. cepacia keratitis was generally poor both in our and previously reported cases (Tables 1 and \u200band2).2). The unfavorable visual outcomes may be related to old age, poor vision at presentation, comorbidities, and mixed infections. The rather high surgical rates and perforation rates may also contribute to the poor prognosis of the disease. The retrospective design and small sample size are the limitations of this study. In addition, elucidating the real pathogenic role of B. cepacia was difficult because polymicrobial infections were detected in approximately 40% of our patients. Nevertheless, as the largest case series reporting B. cepacia keratitis, this study provides more detailed information regarding the clinical and microbiological profiles of this infection. In conclusion, although relatively uncommon, B. cepacia could be a causative agent of infectious keratitis. Our findings revealed that preexisting ocular disease, particularly herpetic keratitis, was the leading predisposing factor of B. cepacia keratitis. B. cepacia demonstrated clinical response to the treatment of ceftazidime and fluoroquinolone, but some patients required surgical intervention. However, the visual outcome was generally poor."}]}]},{"species":"Burkholderia contaminans","docs":[{"title":"Burkholderia contaminans: unusual cause of biliary sepsis","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Burkholderia contaminans is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"84-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":229,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Burkholderia contaminans cause?","id":"84-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"biliary tract infection","answer_start":21,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are B. contaminans sensitive to?","id":"84-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole","answer_start":548,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Burkholderia contaminans?","id":"84-1-1-4","answers":[{"text":"bacilli","answer_start":243,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" We report a case of biliary tract infection caused by a strain of Burkholderia contaminans, a member of the Burkholderia cepacia complex.

Unlike most other Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) species, B. ubonensis is considered non-pathogenic, although its virulence potential has not been tested. Antibiotic resistance in B. ubonensis, particularly towards drugs used to treat the most severe B. pseudomallei infections, has also been poorly characterised. This study examined the population biology of B. ubonensis, and includes the first reported isolates from the Caribbean. Phylogenomic analysis of 264 B. ubonensis genomes identified distinct clades that corresponded with geographic origin, similar to B. pseudomallei. A small proportion (4%) of strains lacked the 920kb chromosome III replicon, with discordance of presence\/absence amongst genetically highly related strains, demonstrating that the third chromosome of B. ubonensis, like other Bcc species, probably encodes for a nonessential pC3 megaplasmid.

In comparison, all strains could be genotyped using the Bcc scheme. Several strains possessed high-level meropenem resistance (\u226532 \u03bcg\/mL), a concern due to potential transmission of this phenotype to B. pseudomallei.

The clinical course of our patient identifies several unique characteristics of this infection in chronic peritoneal dialysis patients. Four out of the 5 reported patients had to have peritoneal dialysis catheter removal in order to eradicate the infection [1, 2, 3, 4]. Also, 4 out of the 5 reported patients had eventual recovery, but 1 patient developed encapsulating sclerosing peritonitis (Table \u200b(Table1).1). Our patient returned to successful peritoneal dialysis for 6 months. Three out of the 5 reported cases had to be switched to hemodialysis after peritoneal dialysis catheter removal for B. vesicularis peritonitis [1, 2, 3]. List of Brevundimonas peritonitis reports in peritoneal dialysis patients B. vesicularis represents a separate line in the \u03b1-subclass of Proteobacteria, rarely encountered in human infection. It was first described in 1953 by Busing et al. [5], who cultured it from the seminal vesicle of a medicinal leech and initially gave it the name Corynebacterium vesiculare. In 1994, Segers et al. [6] reclassified 2 species originally described as Pseudomonas diminuta and Pseudomonas vesicularis into a new genus Brevundimonas, based on DNA-rRNA hybridization studies, 16S rRNA cataloging, and 16S rRNA sequencing. In the microbiology laboratory, the bacteriologic features characteristic of this organism include production of either a tan-brown water-soluble pigment or a yellow or orange growth pigment and the requirement of special growth factors including pantothenate, biotin, and cyanocobalamin. It is oxidase positive and can give variable results. Only about 25% of B. vesicularis grow on MacConkey agar. Many strains of B. vesicularis have orange color due to an intracellular pigment. This may be correctly identified by automated microbiology systems depending on the type used by the local laboratory. If this organism is suspected based on biochemical properties and the local laboratory has limited ability to identify it, the isolate should be sent to a reference laboratory for further workup and identification. The antibiotic therapy for our patient was hindered by the inability of 2 independent microbiology laboratories to successfully identify B. vesicularis as a true human pathogen. The initial empiric antibiotic therapy in our case failed to adequately treat Brevundimonas peritonitis. In 2004, the International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) guidelines for empiric therapy for peritonitis suggested IP cefazolin for Gram-positive coverage, and ceftazidime for Gram-negative coverage. Our facility at that time utilized vancomycin rather than cefazolin because our local antibiogram reported a high incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Levofloxacin was utilized because it was a recommended empiric treatment for Gram-negative organisms as an alternative to 3rd-generation cephalosporin, and it could be given orally in follow-up [4, 7, 8, 9]. Since B. vesicularis in our patient was sensitive to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, it is possible that if we had used IP ceftazidime from the time of treatment initiation, the patient may have had a better outcome. Indeed in 2006, we changed our protocol to IP ceftazidime for Gram-negative coverage, and IP vancomycin remained to cover Gram-positive organisms. However, empiric aminoglycosides have not been included in our initial treatment protocol due to their potential nephrotoxic effects on residual renal function [10, 11]. In contrast, recent data suggest that short-term use of aminoglycosides in chronic dialysis patients appears to be safe and does not diminish residual renal function [12]. This is reflected in the 2005 and 2016 guidelines for empiric therapy for peritonitis by the International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) [13, 14]. When our usual antibiotic regimen failed after 6 days, broader antibiotic coverage with aminoglycosides should have been initiated, but this did not occur until 13 days after the onset of illness. B. vesicularis cultured in our patient was sensitive to gentamicin and tobramycin but not to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. A delay in the aminoglycoside administration may have contributed to the refractory peritonitis in our patient. Once our patient received high doses of intravenous ceftriaxone, his peritoneal fluid WBC became normal, and his abdominal symptoms abated. However, 9 days of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid oral therapy suppressed this infection, but he unfortunately suffered a severe relapse. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was selected on the basis of previous case reports published prior to our case [15, 16]. Refractory peritonitis in chronic peritoneal dialysis patients often necessitates peritoneal dialysis catheter removal due to infection with bacteria that produce biofilm, which coats the catheter with slime in which bacteria are embedded. This antibiotic-resistant environment of exopolysaccharides prevents eradication of the infection. Several studies in paper mills have confirmed that B. vesicularis produces exopolysaccharides which form biofilm [17, 18, 19]. We believe that biofilm production by B. vesicularis occurred in 4 of the 5 reported patients and contributed to the failure to eradicate these infections until the peritoneal dialysis catheter was removed. It is possible that our patient contracted B. vesicularis from working in a basement environment. The basement was cool and humid with large amounts of mold that had to be removed before new walls could be constructed. We did not test if B. vesicularis was present in the basement. However, this organism has been isolated from various water-related equipment such as tap water aerators, hospital sinks, water taps and water tanks, dental unit reservoirs, reused dialyzers, bottled mineral water, corneal specimens, and contact lenses. It is possible that improper sterile technique or cleansing by the patient in this environment may have allowed accidental exposure to this organism. A review of the literature reveals that this organism has rarely been implicated in human infections. B. vesicularis has been recovered from human specimens including cerebrospinal fluid, cervical secretions, eye, urine, and wound cultures [20]. B. vesicularis is associated with a wide range of human infections including cellulitis, pneumonia, septicemia, tonsillitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis, meningitis, skin infections, keratitis, and peritonitis. Antimicrobial resistance of this organism to antibiotics often used to treat Gram-negative infections is common [21]. B. vesicularis isolates in our case were found to be resistant to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, but susceptible to 3rd-generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. However, resistance to 3rd-generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides has been reported in other cases [21]. It is difficult to recommend the best empiric therapy for this organism because of variable antimicrobial resistance. There is only limited clinical experience in treating this infection based on drug resistance results."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can B. vesicularis cause?","id":"89-3-4-1","answers":[{"text":"peritonitis","answer_start":27,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"In summary, B. vesicularis peritonitis in chronic peritoneal dialysis patients appears to be refractory to antibiotic therapy alone.

B. dentium displayed acid resistance, with high viability over a pH range from 4 to 7; findings that correlated to the expression of Na+\/H+ antiporters within the B. dentium genome. B. dentium was found to adhere to human MUC2+ mucus and harbor mucin-binding proteins. Using microbial phenotyping microarrays and fully-defined media, we demonstrated that in the absence of glucose, B. dentium could metabolize a variety of nutrient sources. Many of these nutrient sources were plant-based, suggesting that B. dentium can consume dietary substances. In contrast to other bifidobacteria, B. dentium was largely unable to grow on compounds found in human mucus; a finding that was supported by its glycosyl hydrolase (GH) profile. Of the proteins identified in B. dentium by proteomic analysis, a large cohort of proteins were associated with diverse metabolic pathways, indicating metabolic plasticity which supports colonization of the dynamic gastrointestinal environment.

The establishment of bifidobacteria in the intestine is connected with beneficial health effects, including immune development, neuromodulation, inhibition of pathogens, and modulation of the intestinal microbiota composition [11\u201323]. To produce these beneficial effects, bifidobacteria must be able to survive gastrointestinal (GI) transit and persist in the dynamic environment of the intestine. Thus, analysis of the mechanisms of intestinal survival and colonization are pivotal to understand the functional activities of bifidobacteria. Nutrient availability and utilization shapes the composition and gene expression of the intestinal microbiota [11, 24\u201330]. Broad genomic approaches have predicted that bifidobacteria can use a wide variety of nutrient sources to colonize the human GI tract [5, 25, 31\u201335]. More direct studies that have examined growth parameters of bifidobacteria have largely focused on carbohydrate metabolism [36]. As a result, information about the physiology and metabolic profiles of any one Bifidobacterium species is fragmented. Identifying the strategies used by specific bifidobacteria to harvest dietary nutrients is important for defining the metabolic properties that underpin ecological fitness in and adaptation to the human intestinal environment. Moreover, this information could be employed to increase the presence of select bifidobacteria in the intestine and harness their associated health benefits. The aim of this study was to identify key pathways in ecological niche development of Bifidobacterium dentium. B. dentium is a member of the oral and intestinal microbiome. It is frequently isolated from healthy infant stool [3, 6\u20138] and has an approximate relative abundance of 0.7% in healthy human adults according to the Human Microbiome Project consortium [37\u201341]. We have previously demonstrated that B. dentium colonizes gnotobiotic mice, promotes goblet cell maturation, secretion of the mucin protein MUC2, stimulates intestinal serotonin production, generates the neurotransmitter \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), alleviates visceral hypersensitivity and regulates the gut-brain-axis [21\u201323, 38, 42]. The importance of these functions in GI health motivated us to characterize the metabolic profile of B. dentium to identify environmental queues that can influence intestinal colonization. We sought to characterize the metabolic capacity of B. dentium using microbial phenotype microarray technology, genome analysis and proteomics. This work is among the first to delineate the metabolic profile of B. dentium ATCC 27678. Our data suggest that B. dentium adheres to the intestinal mucus layer, exhibits acid resistance, and utilizes a wide range of physiologically abundant dietary nutrient sources commonly found in the intestine. These data suggest that B. dentium is well-adapted for life in the gastrointestinal tract."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where does B. dentium normally exist?","id":"90-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"infant and adult intestinal","answer_start":2197,"id":1},{"text":"oral","answer_start":2302,"id":2},{"text":"dental caries","answer_start":2346,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"The human GI tract is a highly competitive environment characterized by fluctuations in nutrient source availability. As a result, metabolic versatility, which allows microbes to use multiple carbon, nitrogen, and other sources, is characteristic of successful commensal microbes. In this study, we provide an in-depth analysis of B. dentium growth in a myriad of conditions, including varying acid conditions and nutrient sources (Fig. 9). We demonstrate that B. dentium can survive conditions which mirror the transit through the GI tract and adheres to intestinal mucus, indicating adaptation as a commensal member of the GI tract. The data gathered in this study also provide a substantial amount of information on the growth-promoting properties of B. dentium. We demonstrate that in the absence of glucose, B. dentium can still use 14 sugars, 4 amino acids\/amino acid derivatives\/amines, 3 glycosides, and 1 organic acid to support its growth. These data reveal metabolic flexibility in nutrient utilization in B. dentium, which likely is key to successful competition in the dynamic intestinal milieu. Despite some carbon sources supporting only modest\/or short-term growth, according to Rolf Freter\u2019s nutrient niche hypothesis, we interpret this finding as being both a necessary and a sufficient component of B. dentium ecological fitness in the GI tract. It is highly unlikely that long term carbon utilization will depend on any single source in vivo, but short-term utilization of variable and transient nutrients is critical to successful colonization [69\u201371]. The data presented demonstrate B. dentium\u2019s ability to grow and thrive under varying conditions found in the gastrointestinal tract. These findings enlighten our understanding of the diverse sources that regulate B. dentium\u2019s ability to colonize the human intestine.  Proposed model for B. dentium intestinal colonization. Our data suggest that B. dentium is acid resistant, adheres to the intestinal mucus layer and consumes a variety of dietary sources. We speculate that these features contribute to the ability of B. dentium to colonize the intestine Like other bifidobacteria, B. dentium is a recognized member of the infant and adult intestinal microbiome [3, 6\u20138, 37]. However, B. dentium species are also members of the oral microbiome and have been identified in dental caries [33, 50, 72\u201381]. In addition to B. dentium, B. breve, B. adolescentis, and B. longum have also been isolated from dental caries [33, 50, 72\u201381]. Although the precise role bifidobacteria plays in dental caries is unknown, Bifidobacterium species may be bystanders due to their adhesive properties and their resistance to acidity [50, 82\u201384]. In gnotobiotic animals, B. dentium was found to have beneficial effects on the host, with no adverse effects noted [21\u201323, 42]; suggesting that B. dentium also participates as a commensal intestinal microbe. Dealing with acid stress is an important factor for colonizing gut microbes. Acid tolerance in bifidobacteria has been linked to the activity of the membrane H + -F1F0-ATPase [53, 85]. The H + -F1F0-ATPase enzyme is responsible for maintaining pH homeostasis in most anaerobic microbes. Acid-resistant Bifidobacterium species like B. animalis activate the F1F0-ATPase complex upon acid exposure [86, 87]. B. dentium encodes the genes for the H + -F1F0-ATPase (KEGG) and based on the relative resistance of B. dentium to low pH, we speculate that the H + F1F0-ATPase is likely activated. In B. longum, low extracellular pH is reflected by a low intracellular pH [85]. Similar to the literature, our data indicate that B. dentium\u2019s intracellular pH can reach a low level without a significant loss in viability. Although these experiments were performed in rich bacterial media, we speculate that B. dentium would survive the transit of the gastrointestinal tract. Together, these findings suggest that B. dentium harbors compensatory mechanisms to withstand the various pHs of the gastrointestinal tract. Nutrient availability may be limited in the intestinal lumen due to a variety of factors including competition by other microbes, absorption by the host, or transit through the GI system. Therefore, metabolic plasticity is key to successful microbial colonization. Recent analysis of multiple oral and intestinal derived B. dentium genomes identified 140 conserved genes among B. dentium strains, indicating a high degree of phylogenetic relatedness [88]. All B. dentium genomes shared 19 glycosyl hydrolases families, with the highest abundance observed in GH13. This is consistent with our B. dentium ATCC 27678 analysis, which revealed the highest expression of GH13. The glycobiome of B. dentium strains also indicated a degradation of a wide range of carbohydrates and plant-derived polysaccharides [88]. Using Biolog phenotyping arrays, we identified that in the absence of glucose, B. dentium ATCC 27678 readily uses mannose, xylose, mannitol, maltose, sucrose, melibiose, gentiobiose, trunose, raffinose, maltotriose, and stachyose, Sedoheptulosan. We also observed growth with galactose, which supports previous work indicating that galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) supplementation bolsters the abundance of bifidobacteria [1, 2, 89]. This is also consistent with the B. dentium ATCC 27678 genome, which contains the GH enzyme for \u03b2-galactosidases (GH2 and GH42 families), likely allowing B. dentium to grow on galacto-oligosaccharides. Interestingly, we found that in the absence of glucose, B. dentium was unable to use several polysaccharides which normally promote bifidobacterial growth. These included well characterized inulin, lactulose, and pectin. Prebiotic substrates, in particular inulin and lactulose, have been used in human trials where they have been observed to increase Bifidobacterium spp. and provide beneficial effects to the host [13, 36, 90\u201393]. The addition of glucose back into the LDM4 preparation in our studies showed that B. dentium ATCC 27678 growth was enhanced with inulin, confirming the dependence on glucose for inulin metabolism [63]. We also observed that in the absence of glucose, B. dentium was able to use amino acids to support baseline growth. Limited data are available on nitrogen assimilation in the gut lumen, particularly by Bifidobacterium species [94]. Herein, we provide evidence for metabolism of select amino acids in lieu of a carbohydrate-based carbon source which can be used as carbon or nitrogen substrates as needed. We also found that B. dentium was largely unable to use host glycan sugars. This finding is consistent with the GH profile of B. dentium and our previous work which found that B. dentium could not degrade intact MUC2 mucus [42]. Other bifidobacteria, such as B. bifidum (PRL2010, D119 and L22), B. breve NCIMB8807, and B. longum NCIMB8809, harbor a much larger repertoire of mucin-degrading glycosyl hydrolases [95\u201399]. These mucin- and HMO-degrading GHs likely provide these Bifidobacterium strains with a competitive edge, allowing these microbes to be found at greater abundance than B. dentium in vivo. Consistent with GHs profile, we found that B. dentium exhibited substantial growth on \u03b2-glucans. B. dentium harbors GH 1, 3 and 30 which harbor \u03b2-glucosidases which can degrade plant based \u03b2-glucans and natural phenols, such as salicin, arbutin and amygdalin. Additionally, B. dentium had robust growth on these \u03b2-glucans, indicating that B. dentium may target plant-based nutrients. Our in vitro findings indicate that B. dentium supports it growth with several plant-derived compounds which closely mirrors dietary studies in humans. For example, consumption of pea and whey protein extract increases bifidobacteria levels in healthy subjects [100\u2013102]. Consumption of date fruits, containing high levels of glucose, fructose, and sucrose, has also been reported to increase the relative abundance of bifidobacteria [103\u2013105]. Diets rich in non-digestible carbohydrates, such as whole grain and wheat bran, are also linked to increases in bifidobacteria [106, 107]. In contrast, a Western diet (high in animal protein and fat, low in fiber) has been associated with decreased bifidobacteria [108\u2013110]. These human studies support the important role of dietary compounds in modulating the microbial community and influencing the levels of bifidobacteria. Bifidobacteria have been associated with numerous health benefits, including immune-modulation, gut-brain-axis cross-talk, increasing intestinal mucus, enhancing epithelial integrity, pathogen exclusion, cancer prevention, and management of inflammatory bowel disease [16, 21, 23, 38, 42, 93, 111\u2013143]. Thus, maintenance of bifidobacteria is likely important for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Based on our newly identified nutrient sources for B. dentium, we propose that these compounds could be implemented in the future to promote B. dentium abundance in the human gastrointestinal tract. Collectively this work provides novel insights into the proteome and metabolic profile of B. dentium and our findings point to B. dentium as a well-adapted member of the gastrointestinal tract."}]},{"title":"The Bifidobacterium dentium Bd1 genome sequence reflects its genetic adaptation to the human oral cavity","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does B. dentium normally exist?","id":"90-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"dental caries","answer_start":525,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Bifidobacterium dentium cause?","id":"90-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"cariogenic","answer_start":317,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Bifidobacterium dentium?","id":"90-2-1-3","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic cariogenic pathogen","answer_start":303,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Bifidobacteria, one of the relatively dominant components of the human intestinal microbiota, are considered one of the key groups of beneficial intestinal bacteria (probiotic bacteria). However, in addition to health-promoting taxa, the genus Bifidobacterium also includes Bifidobacterium dentium, an opportunistic cariogenic pathogen. The genetic basis for the ability of B. dentium to survive in the oral cavity and contribute to caries development is not understood. The genome of B. dentium Bd1, a strain isolated from dental caries, was sequenced to completion to uncover a single circular 2,636,368 base pair chromosome with 2,143 predicted open reading frames. Annotation of the genome sequence revealed multiple ways in which B. dentium has adapted to the oral environment through specialized nutrient acquisition, defences against antimicrobials, and gene products that increase fitness and competitiveness within the oral niche. B. dentium Bd1 was shown to metabolize a wide variety of carbohydrates, consistent with genome-based predictions, while colonization and persistence factors implicated in tissue adhesion, acid tolerance, and the metabolism of human saliva-derived compounds were also identified. Global transcriptome analysis demonstrated that many of the genes encoding these predicted traits are highly expressed under relevant physiological conditions. This is the first report to identify, through various genomic approaches, specific genetic adaptations of a Bifidobacterium taxon, Bifidobacterium dentium Bd1, to a lifestyle as a cariogenic microorganism in the oral cavity. In silico analysis and comparative genomic hybridization experiments clearly reveal a high level of genome conservation among various B. dentium strains. The data indicate that the genome of this opportunistic cariogen has evolved through a very limited number of horizontal gene acquisition events, highlighting the narrow boundaries that separate commensals from opportunistic pathogens.

After an initial intravenous therapy, a prolonged treatment course is required and if possible, a switch to an oral combination treatment is recommended . In parallel, the pathogenicity of Cutibacterium species has long been restricted to skin conditions  whereas Cutibacterium acnes is increasingly recognized as a pathogen mainly involved in foreign-body infections . The aim of this study was to report the first Cutibacterium namnetense infection and how this new pathogenic Cutibacterium species from the skin microbiota emerged after a S. aureus infection treatment. In this issue, rifampin, a bactericidal antibiotic that diffuses well in bone tissue and bacterial biofilm, plays a key role in bone and joint infections. Indeed, it remains the cornerstone of the Gram-positive bacteria osteoarticular infections treatment, especially those including device-related infections. A 21 years-old man was admitted for an open fracture of tibia and fibula (Cauchoix classification 2) after a traffic accident. Initial surgical treatment consisted of an external fixator to the tibia and intra-medullary wires in fibula. Two months after initial surgery, the patient presented skin necrosis and pseudarthrosis as judged from the computed tomography scan. Blood leukocyte count and C-reactive protein level were normal. A two-stage surgery was decided to treat the pseudarthrosis. The second stage of surgery relied on consolidation of the tibia using an intramedullary rod during which five tissue samples were collected and antibiotic therapy was started using vancomycin (2g\/day) and gentamicin (200 mg\/day). In culture, after one day of incubation at 37\u00b0C, all samples were positive for S. aureus. The isolate was fully susceptible except for erythromycin. Antibiotic therapy was switched to oral combination including levofloxacin (500 mg\/day) and rifampin (1200 mg\/day) for twelve weeks. One year later, a pyogenic granuloma developed on the screw of the former external fixator, suggesting an underlying infection. Treatment consisted of material removal associated with cloxacillin (4g\/day) and gentamicin (200 mg\/day) treatment. After 4 days of incubation, cultures of four out of five samples (subcutaneous, biopsy and bone samples) were positive for an anaerobic Gram-positive rod identified as Cutibacterium sp. After complementary identification investigations using phenotypic, genetic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic methods, the microorganism was finally identified as the newly described species, Cutibacterium namnetense . Importantly, this species can be misidentified but genome sequencing confirmed that this microorganism represents a distinct, albeit close relative to C. acnes . In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility tests using Etest method revealed a susceptibility to amoxicillin and levofloxacin (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration = 0.25 mg\/L), and a rifampin-resistance (MIC > 32 mg\/L). The treatment was changed to amoxicillin (6 g per day) for two months. Clinical outcome was favorable after a four years follow-up. To characterize the rifampin resistance, DNA from this clinical resistant isolate was extracted using the InstaGene Matrix method (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Six overlapping regions of the rpoB gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced as previously described . The obtained rpoB gene sequence was compared to the rpoB gene sequence of a C. acnes reference strain KPA171202. Due to their genomic and phylogenetic similarities and the average nucleotide identity value being 88.5%  (Genbank accession number NC006085), comparisons revealed a single mutation at position 440 leading to a substitution from His to Arg and conferring high-level rifampin resistance. This mutation has been previously reported in C. acnes clinical isolates . Here, the treatment of the first S. aureus infection consisted in rifampin combined with levofloxacin during twelve weeks, following IDSA guidelines . Interestingly, a superinfection at the same site with another bacterial species (C. namnetense) occurred. This bacterial species, originating most probably from the skin microbiota, was selected by the first treatment, aiming at treating the S. aureus infection. In the present study, three arguments could explain the resistance development in C. namnetense: (i) the C. namnetense high inoculum during this infection (four out of five samples were positive in culture in four days with numerous colonies, leading to a tibia pandiaphysitis linked to the former external fixator (portal of entry), (ii) the levofloxacin MIC (0.25 mg\/L) that might be less protective than moxifloxacin (MIC= 0.06 mg\/L) for rifampin mutant selection, (iii) the high-mutation frequency induced by rifampin , highlighting the reason why rifampin should not be prescribed alone . Therefore, rifampin might have selected resistant bacteria within an important inoculum including opportunistic ones. Indeed, Cutibacterium species are commensal bacteria belonging to skin flora and mostly involved in implant-associated infections .

After an initial intravenous therapy, a prolonged treatment course is required and if possible, a switch to an oral combination treatment is recommended . In parallel, the pathogenicity of Cutibacterium species has long been restricted to skin conditions  whereas Cutibacterium acnes is increasingly recognized as a pathogen mainly involved in foreign-body infections . The aim of this study was to report the first Cutibacterium namnetense infection and how this new pathogenic Cutibacterium species from the skin microbiota emerged after a S. aureus infection treatment. In this issue, rifampin, a bactericidal antibiotic that diffuses well in bone tissue and bacterial biofilm, plays a key role in bone and joint infections. Indeed, it remains the cornerstone of the Gram-positive bacteria osteoarticular infections treatment, especially those including device-related infections. A 21 years-old man was admitted for an open fracture of tibia and fibula (Cauchoix classification 2) after a traffic accident. Initial surgical treatment consisted of an external fixator to the tibia and intra-medullary wires in fibula. Two months after initial surgery, the patient presented skin necrosis and pseudarthrosis as judged from the computed tomography scan. Blood leukocyte count and C-reactive protein level were normal. A two-stage surgery was decided to treat the pseudarthrosis. The second stage of surgery relied on consolidation of the tibia using an intramedullary rod during which five tissue samples were collected and antibiotic therapy was started using vancomycin (2g\/day) and gentamicin (200 mg\/day). In culture, after one day of incubation at 37\u00b0C, all samples were positive for S. aureus. The isolate was fully susceptible except for erythromycin. Antibiotic therapy was switched to oral combination including levofloxacin (500 mg\/day) and rifampin (1200 mg\/day) for twelve weeks. One year later, a pyogenic granuloma developed on the screw of the former external fixator, suggesting an underlying infection. Treatment consisted of material removal associated with cloxacillin (4g\/day) and gentamicin (200 mg\/day) treatment. After 4 days of incubation, cultures of four out of five samples (subcutaneous, biopsy and bone samples) were positive for an anaerobic Gram-positive rod identified as Cutibacterium sp. After complementary identification investigations using phenotypic, genetic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic methods, the microorganism was finally identified as the newly described species, Cutibacterium namnetense . Importantly, this species can be misidentified but genome sequencing confirmed that this microorganism represents a distinct, albeit close relative to C. acnes . In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility tests using Etest method revealed a susceptibility to amoxicillin and levofloxacin (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration = 0.25 mg\/L), and a rifampin-resistance (MIC > 32 mg\/L). The treatment was changed to amoxicillin (6 g per day) for two months. Clinical outcome was favorable after a four years follow-up. To characterize the rifampin resistance, DNA from this clinical resistant isolate was extracted using the InstaGene Matrix method (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Six overlapping regions of the rpoB gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced as previously described . The obtained rpoB gene sequence was compared to the rpoB gene sequence of a C. acnes reference strain KPA171202. Due to their genomic and phylogenetic similarities and the average nucleotide identity value being 88.5%  (Genbank accession number NC006085), comparisons revealed a single mutation at position 440 leading to a substitution from His to Arg and conferring high-level rifampin resistance. This mutation has been previously reported in C. acnes clinical isolates . Here, the treatment of the first S. aureus infection consisted in rifampin combined with levofloxacin during twelve weeks, following IDSA guidelines . Interestingly, a superinfection at the same site with another bacterial species (C. namnetense) occurred. This bacterial species, originating most probably from the skin microbiota, was selected by the first treatment, aiming at treating the S. aureus infection. In the present study, three arguments could explain the resistance development in C. namnetense: (i) the C. namnetense high inoculum during this infection (four out of five samples were positive in culture in four days with numerous colonies, leading to a tibia pandiaphysitis linked to the former external fixator (portal of entry), (ii) the levofloxacin MIC (0.25 mg\/L) that might be less protective than moxifloxacin (MIC= 0.06 mg\/L) for rifampin mutant selection, (iii) the high-mutation frequency induced by rifampin , highlighting the reason why rifampin should not be prescribed alone . Therefore, rifampin might have selected resistant bacteria within an important inoculum including opportunistic ones. Indeed, Cutibacterium species are commensal bacteria belonging to skin flora and mostly involved in implant-associated infections . Cutibacterium namnetense is an opportunistic pathogen, selected mainly by rifampin treatment. The mutation that confers rifampin resistance found in rpoB gene (cluster I) was already described in C. acnes, in vitro . The position 440 represents a hot spot in rpoB gene.

Post-procedural infections, including splenic abscess after coronary bypass [13], and cardiac catheterization [14] have also been described in immunocompetent patients [15]. C. avidum is highly susceptible to multiple antimicrobials, including beta-lactam agents and fluoroquinolones. Clindamycin resistance has been described [4], and in our case, maybe could explain the failure of antibiotic perioperative prophylaxis and further empirical treatment, but unfortunately, we could not perform susceptibility testing.

One of the current prevention strategies is immediate skin antisepsis before surgery in conjunction with single dose antibiotic prophylaxis 30\u201360 minutes prior to surgery to eliminate viable bacteria on the skin, which we also used in this study. C. avidum is a natural inhabitant of the human skin in particular in obese patients [10, 11] and recently recognized as a relevant pathogen in hip PJIs [7\u20139]. In our study of 60 patients, 12 (20%) were colonized with C. avidum prior to hip surgery. Pre-operative skin antisepsis eliminated C. avidum in 80% of patients. In fact, we found viable C. avidum in 20% of the patients on the skin surface, which might be a risk factor for intraoperative colonization of the joint prosthesis and thus for developing a PJI. We strictly followed the required exposure time of antiseptics given by the manufacturer specifications (one minute exposure time before major interventions) and by the in-house guidelines of a minimum of three antiseptical rounds. This may not be enough when implanting foreign material. This is the first study revealing the insufficient antisepsis of C. avidum on the skin. Other studies focusing on different microorganisms and different skin antisepsis strategies show similar results [8, 34, 35]. In a randomized trial, Patrick et al. showed that skin antisepsis with sequential application of PVI and CHG reduced the bacterial numbers in the surgical wound more effectively than PVI alone in patients undergoing spinal surgery [8]. Blonna et al. found similar results focusing on coagulase-negative staphylococci and C. acnes [35]. For C. acnes, a recent randomized study revealed a higher reduction of C. acnes after skin preparation with topical benzoyl peroxide than with chlorhexidine [36]. Heckmann et al. evaluated whether higher concentrations of chlorhexidine with an additional mechanical scrub would be more effective in eliminating growth of C. acnes than standard antisepsis [37]. No significant difference was found leading to the conclusion that also mechanical scrub cannot eradicate C. acnes in deeper layers of the skin. Further studies are needed to improve antisepsis strategies of the skin prior to surgery with focus on reaching the dermis including the subepidermal glands for completely killing any viable bacteria on the skin at time of surgery. For that, an innovative approach could be the application of photodynamic therapy (PDT) [34, 38\u201341] to reduce colonizing bacteria. In a recent study we showed a 100% reduction of viable bacteria after skin antisepsis and PDT with methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) [34]. The treatment, however, led to transient skin erythema which is an obstacle for immediate surgery. PDT is certainly very promising but the optimal parameters with the ideal balance of bactericidal effect versus skin irritation have to be investigated. In one patient, we visualized bacteria at the border of the subcutaneous fat tissue indicating a possible niche for bacteria protected from skin antisepsis and thus a potential source for contamination of deep peri-implant tissue at time of surgical incision and implantation of the hip prosthesis. A recent study reported the presence of bacteria in deep tissues, which were considered as sterile areas [42], leading to the assumption that not only the superficial skin bacteria but also bacteria in the dermis may find the way to deeper structures and infect an implant. Lee et al. found viable C. acnes\u2014another skin commensal\u2014in the dermal tissue in 7 out of 10 male volunteers after surface skin antisepsis [43]. Remaining bacteria in dermal glands can be a source of inoculation of deeper structures by surgical incision [44]. There is an increasing number of studies describing C. acnes remaining in dermis despite skin antisepsis [45, 46]. However, we found no viable bacteria in the dermis with routine tissue culture methods. No other study than ours exists so far focusing on C. avidum persistance on skin surface and\/or in deeper structures after surgical antisepsis. In our study, the FISH-results showed, that in most of the cases, only a few single bacteria per section were detected, mostly in the subcutis stained by DAPI, but the FISH probes showed no signal, which indicate a rather resting or inactive state. Only in one case, DAPI-positive bacteria were also tested FISH-positive indicating ribsosome-rich and presumably viable C. avidum. The low numbers of FISH-positive bacteria, however, could be influenced by the routine single antibiotic prophylaxis 30\u201360 min before the start of the surgery aiming bactericidal antibiotic concentration in the operating field. A limitation of our study is the intraoperative focus on C. avidum and not on other colonizing bacteria, which resulted in evaluating the skin antisepsis effect in a low number of patients. Another limitation is the fact that we did not inhibit the antiseptics and possibly transferred traces into the eSwabs during the scraping of the skin. This might have caused inhibition and an underestimation of the actual bacterial growth. Since we focused on C. avidum, which has a prolonged cultivation time, screening for skin colonization had to be completed 7\u201314 days before surgery and may be different than a screening performed on the day of surgery."}]},{"title":"Clinical and Biological Features of Cutibacterium (Formerly Propionibacterium) avidum, an Underrecognized Microorganism","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Cutibacterium avidum normally exist?","id":"96-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"skin","answer_start":273,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Cutibacterium avidum cause?","id":"96-3-1-2","answers":[{"text":"breast infections, skin abscesses, infective endocarditis, and device-related infections","answer_start":536,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Cutibacterium avidum?","id":"96-3-1-3","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic","answer_start":402,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are C. avidum sensitive to?","id":"96-3-1-4","answers":[{"text":"a broad spectrum of antibiotics, such as \u03b2-lactams, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and rifampin, although erythromycin","answer_start":1777,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are C. avidum resistant to?","id":"96-3-1-5","answers":[{"text":"clindamycin","answer_start":1899,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"The recent description of the genus Cutibacterium has altered the taxonomy of Propionibacterium species.

This underrecognized microorganism can, however, act as a pathogen after bacterial seeding and can be considered opportunistic, causing either superficial or deep\/invasive infections. It can cause numerous infections, including but not limited to breast infections, skin abscesses, infective endocarditis, and device-related infections. The ecological niche of C. avidum is clearly different from that of other members of the genus: it is found in the axillary region or at wet sites rather than in dry, exposed areas, and the number of microorganisms increases during puberty. Historically, it has been used for its ability to modulate the immune response and for its antitumor properties. Conventional microbial culture methods and identification processes allow for its accurate identification and characterization. Thanks to the modern omics tools used for phylogenomic approaches, understanding C. avidum pathogenesis (including host-bacterium interactions and virulence factor characterization) is becoming easier, allowing for more thorough molecular characterization. These analyses have revealed that C. avidum causes diverse diseases mediated by multiple virulence factors. The recent genome approach has revealed specific genomic regions within this species that are involved in adherence and biofilm formation as well as fitness, survival, and defense functions. Numerous regions show the presence of phages and horizontal gene transfer. C. avidum remains highly sensitive to a broad spectrum of antibiotics, such as \u03b2-lactams, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and rifampin, although erythromycin and clindamycin resistance has been described.

It belongs to the class Actinobacteria of the order Propionibacteriales (3). Following its discovery in a patient with a chronic skin disease called \u201cacne vulgaris,\u201d Propionibacterium acnes, henceforth called Cutibacterium acnes, underwent a series of taxonomic changes. It was successively placed in the genus Bacillus and then the genus Corynebacterium (4, 5). However, in 1946, Douglas and Gunter were able to demonstrate that this microorganism was more closely related to the Propionibacterium genus members since, like other species of this genus, it ferments lactose to propionic acid in an anaerobic atmosphere (6, 7). Recently, a significant taxonomic revision was proposed by Scholz and Kilian, placing all Propionibacterium species from the skin microbiota within a new genus (8). As a result, Propionibacterium is replaced by Cutibacterium for P. avidum, P. acnes, P. granulosum, and the more recently discovered species P. namnetense (9) and P. humerusii (10). Too often ignored or considered a contaminant in cultures (especially in hemolin performance diphasic medium for blood cultures), these species are the subject of renewed interest, with literature results on these organisms increasing from 100 papers per year in 2000 to some 230 to 240 per year since 2013. In this review, I focus on Cutibacterium avidum, a Gram-positive, anaerobic-aerotolerant rod which is a minor colonizer and resident of the human skin. Its ecological niche is clearly different from that of other members of this genus due to a specific tropism for wet areas (11). Although often defined as a commensal (12, 13), C. avidum has likely been underestimated, unrecognized, and misidentified in more than a few clinical cases. Despite its low frequency in human infections, numerous associated or invasive infections have been reported: bone infections, infective endocarditis (IE), breast infections, abdominal infections, prostate infections, and splenic and skin abscesses have been described, sometimes with significant collateral damage for the patient (14,\u201317). In my experience, although one cannot avoid bias according to the identification method used and the awareness of microbiologists, there has been a clearly observed increase in C. avidum-positive samples over the past years. A plausible explanation for the increased awareness of this microorganism is probably the introduction of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight (MALDI-TOF) technology in numerous laboratories. Most positive samples have been from blood cultures and valve, bone, tissue, and deep perioperative specimens. Interestingly, most of them were recovered from deep tissue samples taken from immunosuppressed patients or patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In the 1970s, C. avidum was considered a less virulent bacterium or culture contaminant (3), but a specific dedicated preparation was used as an adjuvant in antitumor therapies (18) or as an immunity stimulant (19). Later, following various studies, the key role played by Cutibacterium species, especially C. avidum, in immune response modulation was demonstrated (20). Indeed, this species has been reported to be an immunomodifier, stimulating the various cell subset populations involved in nonspecific antibacterial, antiviral, or antitumor abilities (21). Thereafter, biochemical characterization of the cell wall (22) and specific interactions with reticuloendothelial cell systems (23), including various lymphocyte subpopulations, demonstrated its medical significance. Following the culture-centric period, which focused on developing new tools to better understand bacterial growth, metabolism, and immunogenicity, we are now entering a new genomic era. This new period will allow us to decipher virulence factors, genome organization, genome plasticity, and specific features of several C. avidum clinical strains by using next-generation sequencing (13, 14) and confirming hypotheses through various in vitro and in vivo models. As a result, deeper genomic analyses and comparisons will provide key information about the organism's phylogeny and the potential existence of subpopulations within this species. Such results have been described for C. acnes clinical strains, with a correlation of different clusters or lineages involved in specific clinical entities. Although a whole-genome synteny has been reported for propionibacteria originating from the skin, a certain plasticity of the genome has revealed C. avidum-specific genomic regions. This observation demonstrated the importance of these genomic regions, which include exopolysaccharide gene synthesis functions, prophage regions, and other gene-specific clusters involved in diverse fitness, survival, and defense functions (14). Although only 2 of 14 complete genomes are publicly available, C. avidum genomic studies remain relevant to furthering the understanding of the pathogenesis of this organism. In light of the growing number of C. avidum infections, I review both the physiopathology and the clinical\/microbiological significance of C. avidum as the causative agent of invasive and deep infections and provide an extended view of its biochemical features, immune responsiveness, and culture and identification methods as well as a genomic analysis based on publicly available data.

Previous studies have reported that this bacterium can be detected in human skin [3, 4]. This organism was formally termed as \u201cCutibacterium modestum\u201d in 2020 [5]. MALDI-TOF MS is widely used for bacterial identification and allows for the relatively easy and quick identification of microorganisms, including C. acnes. However, the predominant peaks on mass spectrometry of C. modestum are different compared with those of C. acnes and its subspecies [6]. MALDI-TOF MS originally suggested that our isolate was C. acnes. However, the log score 1.62 of this species was not adequate to accurately identify the bacteria on either the species or genus level. In addition, the biochemical qualities of this isolate, in particular glycine arylamidase and indole levels, were not consisting with those of C. acnes and other Cutibacterim species [7]. We therefore performed 16SrRNA sequencing of the isolate. Biochemical analysis was very important for distinguishing C. modestum from other Cutibacterium species. Since the description of Propionibacterium humerusii in 2011 and its new name C. modestum, no literature has reported a clinical C. modestum infection in humans. We were able to successfully treat this patient using antibiotics alone in accordance with the EUCAST breakpoint for C. acnes and Gram-positive anaerobes [8]. However, whether our choice of antibiotic was appropriate is uncertain. Accumulation of clinical experience of human infection caused by C. modestum is required to answer this question. Recently, an implant-associated C. modestum infection was reported [9]. Our case patient was diagnosed as native vertebral osteomyelitis. Implant-associated C. acnes infections have been previously reported [10, 11], as well as Cutibacterium species-related native vertebral osteomyelitis. Growth of Cutibacterium species depends on the bacterial inoculum size. It took 7 days for blood culture growth in our case. This suggests low inoculum of bacteremia in this case. When Cutibacterium species is considered as causative pathogen, prolonged blood culture incubation might be feasible. In conclusion, we reported the native vertebral osteomyelitis due to C. modestum. C. modestum is very similar to C. acnes, and may be misidentified as C. acnes.

This organism is a part of the normal flora of human skin and mucosa, with a capacity to cause disease in individuals with immune impairment, or in those with injury caused by foreign bodies [1]. In recent years, due to increased medical interventions, such as the use of vascular catheters and prosthetic device implants, the prevalence of infections caused by S epidermidis has considerably increased [2,3]. Consequently, this organism is increasingly isolated and identified as a pathogen causing nosocomial sepsis; it accounts for approximately 30% of all nosocomial bloodstream infections [4]. This organism is also associated with a variety of clinical manifestations, including late sepsis in premature infants, central nervous system shunt infection, endocarditis, urinary tract infection, surgical site infection, and endophthalmitis [1]. Although S epidermidis is an opportunistic organism, this microorganism has several virulence factors, such as hemolysin, lipase, protease, lecithinase, DNase and toxins [5]. One of the special features of S epidermidis is the ability to adhere to polymeric surfaces and subsequently form a biofilm [6]. Strong binding of the bacterial biofilm to polymeric surfaces is the 1 step of intravascular catheter-related bacteremia and other device-associated infections, leading to sepsis [7]. In the biofilm there are layers embedded in a matrix of extracellular polysaccharide (slime), which facilitates the adhesion of bacteria onto surfaces, protects them from the host immune response, and serves as an efficient barrier against antimicrobials. Therefore, eradication of bacteria within biofilms is difficult, as the tolerance to antibiotics eventually leads to the removal of contaminated devices [3,6]. Biofilm formation is regulated by the expression of polysaccharide intercellular adhesion (PIA) [6]. PIA is composed of \u03b2 -1,6 N- acetyl glucosamine and is responsible for cell to cell adhesion and is necessary for biofilm formation in S epidermidis strains [6,7]. PIA is encoded by the chromosomal intercellular adhesion (ica) locus, consisting of the icaADBC structural and icaR regulatory genes [8]. Amongst them, the icaA and icaD genes have been reported to play a central role in biofilm production [9], having enzymatic activity (N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase). icaA alone has negligible enzymatic activity [7], but simultaneous expression with icaD initiates activity of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase and produces oligomeres with a length of 20 residues [6,7]. There are various methods to evaluate biofilm formation in bacteria, such as qualitative Congo red agar (CRA), the tube method (TM) [10], and analysis on quantitative micro titer plates (MTP) [3,11]. There is controversy amongst scientists regarding which method is the most reliable for assessing biofilm formation [3,6,10]. However, the microtiter plate biofilm formation assay has been identified as a valuable method [3, 8,12]. Furthermore, molecular DNA-based techniques, such as PCR have been used recently to better understand the molecular mechanisms of biofilm formation [6]. A better understanding of the mechanisms of adhesion by microorganisms to produce a microbial biofilm could identify new procedures to counteract the numerous infections associated with biofilm growth. According to previous studies, controversies involve the selection of a reliable approach to identify biofilm formation in bacteria. In this regard, the aim of the present study was to determine biofilm formation and the presence of icaA and icaD genes in S epidermidis clinical isolates, and evaluate the reliability of CRA, TM, and MTP phenotypic methods for detection of a biofilm."}]}]},{"species":"Staphylococcus hominis","docs":[{"title":"Multifactorial mechanisms of the pathogenesis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hominis isolated from bloodstream infections","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can S. hominis cause?","id":"100-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"bloodstream infections, endocarditis, peritonitis, osteomyelitis, bone and joint infections","answer_start":360,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of S. hominis?","id":"100-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogens","answer_start":322,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Staphylococcus hominis is a species of the Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Among CoNS, S. hominis is one of the three most frequently identified isolates recoverable from the blood of hospitalised patients (Spanu et al. 2003; Chaves et al. 2005; Becker et al. 2014). These bacteria are recognised as potentially opportunistic pathogens and may cause bloodstream infections, endocarditis, peritonitis, osteomyelitis, bone and joint infections (d\u2019Azevedo et al. 2008; Sorlozano et al. 2010; Ruiz de Gopegui et al. 2011; Becker et al. 2014). The majority of the infections caused by staphylococci are associated with the use of indwelling medical devices (Rodhe et al. 2006; Sorlozano et al. 2010; Mendoza-Olazar\u00e1n et al. 2013). The exact mechanisms of S. hominis pathogenicity have still not been determined. The rise of drug-resistant strains is a serious problem in the treatment of infections caused by S. hominis (Sorlozano et al. 2010; Ruiz de Gopegui et al. 2011; Szczuka et al. 2016a, b). Methicillin-resistance is associated with the presence of the mecA gene, which is located on a mobile genetic element, called the staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec). The mecA gene encodes a penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a). As a result of mecA expression, beta-lactam antibiotics are not effective against MRSA. To date, eleven SCCmec types have been described, based on the class of the mec gene complex (A\u2013E) and the ccr gene complex (IWG 2009). The ccr genes encoding recombinases responsible for the integration and excision of SCCmec from the chromosome. According to the literature, SCCmec elements, in CoNS, are highly diverse in their genetic content. The SCCmec can harbour multiple ccr allotypes and\/or the untypeable ccr allotype, and a new combination of the mec complex and the ccr complex (IWG 2009; Rupp\u00e9 et al. 2009; Mendoza-Olazar\u00e1n et al. 2013; Shore and Coleman 2013; Bouchami et al. 2012; Szczuka et al. 2016a, b). Methicillin-resistant staphylococci are most often resistant to a number of widely used antimicrobial agents. For this reason, vancomycin is usually the antibiotic of choice in the treatment of staphylococcal infections. When combination therapy is required, aminoglycosides are used, because of their synergistic bactericidal effect in combination with vancomycin. Resistance to aminoglycosides is usually due to drug inactivation by cellular aminoglycosides-modifying enzymes (AMEs). The bifunctional enzyme AAC(6\u2032)\/APH(2\u2033) encoded by the gene aac(6\u2032)-Ie-aph(2\u2033)-Ia and located on transposon Tn4001, modifies all clinically available aminoglycosides, except streptomycin (Ramirez and Tolmasky 2010). The APH(3\u2032)-III enzyme encoded by the aph(3\u2032)-IIIa gene mediates resistance to kanamycin, neomycin and amikacin. The ANT(4\u2032)-I enzyme encoded by the ant(4\u2032)-Ia gene and occurring on plasmid pUB110, inactivates tobramycin, kanamycin, neomycin and amikacin (Ramirez and Tolmasky 2010; Wendlandt et al. 2013). In this study, we analysed mechanisms of S. hominis virulence. Moreover, the frequency of antibiotic resistance genes and the diversity of the SCCmec types were also determined."}]},{"title":"Staphylococcus hominis Infective Endocarditis Presenting with Embolic Splenic and Renal Infarcts and Spinal Discitis","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether S. hominis is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"100-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-positive","answer_start":42,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does S. hominis normally exist?","id":"100-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"skin","answer_start":135,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can S. hominis cause?","id":"100-2-1-3","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":851,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are S. hominis sensitive to?","id":"100-2-1-4","answers":[{"text":"methicillin","answer_start":610,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Staphylococcus hominis (S. hominis) is a Gram-positive, coagulase-negative bacteria that occurs as a normal commensal organism on the skin and may rarely cause native valve endocarditis (NVE).

Its predominance as a contaminant as well as less virulent properties than other more common infectious etiologies of endocarditis make S. hominis infection diagnostically challenging [1]. Infective endocarditis (IE) is caused by damage to the endocardium of the heart with subsequent colonization by an organism that adheres to the tissue creating a vegetation, more commonly occurring on damaged valves. With a reported incidence of 12.7 cases per 100,000 person-years [2], IE is rare, especially in populations without damaged heart valves or other structural heart conditions. Risk factors that may increase the incidence of IE include valvular insufficiency, degenerative cardiac lesions, congenital heart disease, prosthetic valves, and intravascular infection of cardiac devices. The most common cause of NVE in developed countries is Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), with one study showing up to 42% of NVE in nonnosocomial infections due to S. aureus [3]. Cultures isolating less common pathogens along with nonspecific symptoms of IE may lead to a delay in clinical diagnosis and treatment, increasing the risk for complications. A feared complication of IE is septic embolization, which is due to partial dislodgement of the vegetation into the bloodstream causing spread to peripheral organs.

Of all causes of NVE, CoNS accounts for 5% of cases [4]. Of these cases of CoNS NVE, S. epidermidis is the most common causative pathogen. CoNS are emerging as a cause of NVE and have a rate of mortality similar to that of S. aureus infection, the most common cause of NVE [5, 6]. CoNS are normally considered less invasive as they are primarily skin commensal organisms not commonly causing serious infections. Staphylococcus lugdunensis, unlike other CoNS, can readily cause more severe and invasive infections and should be regarded as a dangerous opportunistic pathogen [7]. Clinicians must determine whether an isolated CoNS from blood culture is a contaminant or the cause of infection. In patients with IE, prompt recognition of the causative pathogen is imperative. Pathogen-directed antibiotic treatment for IE should be started immediately as serious complications of systemic embolization, including, but not limited to, involvement of the central nervous system with ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, meningitis, and intracerebral abscess, may occur [8]. Although our patient had already presented with evidence of embolic phenomena, the timely diagnosis was essential in preventing further hemodynamic compromise, structural disruption of the valve, and further embolization. These cases may be difficult to treat as there may be complications of congestive heart failure and rhythm conduction abnormalities, as in our patient. Even in cases with aggressive medical and surgical treatment, mortality remains at 25% in cases of CoNS endocarditis [9].

Our results contribute to a better understanding of the pathomechanisms of S. haemolyticus infections and fill a gap in the literature regarding the CoNS. Based on our observations, microbiology laboratories should consider S. haemolyticus a critical opportunistic pathogen and infections caused by this organism, particularly in critically ill patients, should be seriously managed."},{"qas":[{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of S. haemolyticus?","id":"102-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":14687,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Our study describedfor the first time the pathogenesis of S. haemolyticus isolated from patients with DFUs on PHSF cells.Staphylococci, including S. haemolyticus,arewidely distributed in hospital environment and are important causative agents of DFUs []. We employed an explant culture method for the isolation of the PHSF cells from human skin, which is a simple, reliable andinexpensive methodfor isolation of skin fibroblasts []. Keratinocytes did not attach to tissue culture plates and were removed by washing with PBSbecause keratinocytes need additional nutritional supplements and growth factors that were not included in our media []. The pathogenicity of S. haemolyticus isolates was directly associated with a broad spectrum of virulence factorswhich play a central role in the pathogenesis of staphylococcal infections. DFU is one of the leading causes of severe complications. These ulcers are caused by microorganisms that may carry different virulence factors. In this study, we analyzed a pool of S. haemolyticus isolates for the presence of genes encoding the enterotoxin, hemolysin, fibronectin-binding protein, and exfoliative toxins genes by PCR using pairs of specific primers. Most S. haemolyticus isolates contained at least one type of the enterotoxin genes, and one isolate contained four different types. Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) constitute a family of nine major serological types of heat-stable enterotoxins that are biologically and structurally related. The most prevalent enterotoxin types were seg, sea and sec genes. Importantly, Skov, Olsen [] reported that the application of the staphylococcal enterotoxin sebon human skin led to the induction of dermatitis, which may contribute to the damage induced by the infection of the diabetic foot ulcers. The ingestion of these toxins results in gastrointestinal manifestations such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. SEs are the leading cause of bacterial food poisoning in human beings and have been described as the cause of many outbreaks of foodborne diseases []. Moreover, these toxins are powerful superantigens that stimulate nonspecific T-cell proliferation and may lead to toxic shock syndrome. Secreted enterotoxins are the major weapons that kill host cells and cause diseases by inducing different types of cell death, particularly apoptosis and necrosis []. Staphylococci can express a variety of virulence factors, including surface proteins such as the FnBPs, which include fnbA and fnbB. These adhesive proteins play a crucial role in bacterial binding and adherence to the extracellular matrix and,accordingly, host cell invasion and bacterial internalization into cells []. Since keratinocytes and skin fibroblasts produce fibronectin and fibrinogen for the promotion of wound healing and tissue repair, these proteins will serve as a target or bacterial FnBPs []. Pereira, Teixeira []demonstrated that in S. aureus, increased virulence has been associated with its adhesive properties. Moreover, the fnbB genes were also involved in intercellular accumulation and development of biofilms []. Microbial infections resulting from bacterial adhesion to biomaterial surfaces have been observed on almost all medical devices []. We found that most S. haemolyticus isolates possessed either fnbA or fnbB or both. fnbA and fnbB genes were absent in SH1. Interestingly, this strain had low ability of invasion into the PHSF cells, pointing to the vital role of fnbA and fnbB genes in adhesion to host cells. Similar to our observation, Tuchscherr, Korpos [] showed that the lack of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) invasiveness in S. aureus isolates was due to defects in FnBPs. The fnBP genes are commonly detected in S. aureus and different researchers reported variable percentages of the fnbA and fnbB genes. Tristan, Ying [] demonstratedthat 43% of S.aureus were positive for fnbB and 28% were positive for fnbA. In 72 Tunisian MRSA isolates, fnbA gene was detected in 12 strains, fnbB gene in 2 strains, and both fnbA and fnbB genes in 2 other strains []. Also, Mirzaee, Najar-Peerayeh [] showed that the prevalence of fnbA and fnbB in MRSA strains was 82.2% and 46.7%, respectively. Although fibronectin adhesion is a major explanation for S. aureus virulence, CoNS internalization is a more controversial issue []. Interestingly, Switalski, Ryden [] showed that S. haemolyticus isolates were able to bind fibronectin. Moreover, S. haemolyticus could bind collagen and vitronectin in a time-dependent manner []. A recent study has examined the binding of S. haemolyticus to human keratinocytes and reported a better adherence of clinical S. haemolyticus compared to commensal strains. Surface shaving analysis identified 65 surface proteins, including 3 adhesins, extracellular matrix binding protein (Embp), Mannosylglucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase (SasH-like) and others. Upon colonization, an increase in SceD and the autolysin Atl genes was observed []. In fact, no previous reports have clearly detected FnBP proteins inCoNS []. Therefore, our results propose a new mechanism for adhesion and internalization of S. haemolyticus. However, more experiments are required to test the expression and upregulation of these genes upon infection of the cells. S. epidermidis has been shown to bind fibronectin bythe extracellular matrix binding protein (Embp), which facilities adhesion to fibronectin and formation of biofilm layers. One of the proposed explanations is that S. epidermidis enters the cells through a tripartite Embp-Fn-\u03b15\u03b21 system which is analogous to the FnBP-Fn-\u03b15\u03b21 integrin in S. aureus []. Indeed, Campoccia, Testoni [] has found that S. epidermidis internalization was 100 times lower than S. aureus internalization. The ability of S. aureus to be internalized by host cells is considered one of the most critical pathogenicity factors in persisting and relapsing infections []. Trends of invasion and intracellular survival were similar in flowcytometry and lysostaphin protection experiments. All S. haemolyticus isolates could invade the PHSF cells to varying degrees. It seems that fibronectin-binding proteins of S. haemolyticus are essential in the process of internalization by PHSF cells since SH1, which was deficient in both genes, produced the least ability of adhesion and invasion. However, the presence of at least one of the known FnBP was significantly associated with marked adhesion and invasion of PHSF cells. Strains that carry both genesinvaded the PHSF cells at a significantly higher level than the other strains. However, more studies are required to test and to quantitatively analyze the expression of the FnBP upon infection of the PHSF cells by S. haemolyticus. The effect of S. haemolyticus on the viability of PHSF cells was tested by observing two outcomes; the reduction of cell viability and proliferation measured by MTT assay and induction of apoptosis, which was measured by Annexin V\/PI staining using flow cytometry. We tested whether the cytotoxic effects were caused by secreted factors or caused only by direct cell invasion. The bacterial cells caused cytotoxic effects similar to those obtained by the cell-free supernatants. This means that viablemetabolically active bacteria were not necessary for the cell-killing ability of the tested isolates and that the bacterial products induced cytotoxic effects, which were comparable to that induced by cellular invasion. The effects on cell viability and apoptosis induced by S. haemolyticus were comparable to the levels induced by S. aureus strains. However, the induction of cytotoxicity was lost when cells were incubated with heat-treated bacteria (65\u00b0C for 30 min), indicating the heat-labile properties of the toxic bacterial products. The cytotoxic effect induced by bacteria is highly dependent on the virulence of the tested microorganism and the cell line []. This study was the first report that described the cytotoxicity of S. haemolyticus bacteria on PHSF cells. In our study, S. haemolyticus isolates exhibited different levels of cytotoxic activity ranging from 11.2% to 80.4%. The cytotoxic activity of whole S. haemolyticus and cell-free supernatants were similar to that induced by whole S. aureus and their supernatants. S. haemolyticus and the filtered bacterial supernatant remarkably decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of the PHSF cells, with different degrees. In another study, S. haemolyticus was able to induce cytotoxicity of the HEp-2 cells (human epidermoid carcinoma cells from the larynx) that ranged from 13.8 to 81.5%. In the same study, preheating of the cell-free supernatants at 56 \u00b0C reduced the cytotoxic activity from 7.1% \u00b11.7% to 19.6% \u00b12.9% []. Moreover, Krzyminska, Szczuka [] showed that all strains of S. haemolyticus exhibited cytotoxic effects on murine macrophage cell line J774, which were evident by the detachment of the cells from the surface of the wells. They also reported that three strains (10%) showed low cytotoxic activity. In contrast to our results, Johansson, Rautelin [] demonstrated that S. aureus isolates were not cytotoxic to HeLaor HT29 cells. Also, El-Housseiny, Aboulwafa [] showed that the cell-free supernatants of the four E. coli isolates caused nearly no cytotoxicity after 3 h of Vero cell infection. On the other hand, the washed bacterial cells caused high cytotoxic effects similar to those obtained by the whole culture. In another study, the filtered supernatant from S. aureus failed to induce apoptosis when applied to endothelial cell monolayers, thereby excluding any effect from the preformed \u03b1-toxin or other soluble bacterial factors []. Also, van Kruchten, Wilden [] showed that human alveolar basal epithelial cell line (A549), bronchial epithelial cell line (Calu-3), primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs) infected with S. aureus alone displayed no apoptosis. Heat treating of S. haemolyticus markedly interfered with the bacterial cytotoxic potential on the PHSF cells. In line with our results, Kahl, Goulian [] showed that apoptosis induced in epithelial cells by infection with heat-killed S. aureus did not manifest any DNA fragmentation. Contrary to our results, Ocana, Asensi [] showed that theinduction of apoptosis in neutrophil incubated with bacteria did not require live bacteria since organisms killed by heat treatment induced the same apoptotic effect. Our results showed that different levels of hemolytic activities were detected in all Staphylococcus isolates. It is generally considered that S. aureus produces four types of hemolysins (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta), which have hemolytic and cytotoxic effects. In particular, the \u03b1-hemolysin (hla) gene causes significant hemolysis []. Moreover, hla of S. aureus was shown to induce apoptosis in peripheral T lymphocytes []. The toxin also disrupts the tissue barrier at host interfaces lined by epithelial or endothelial cells []. Seidl, Leemann [] showed that S. aureus isolates with \u03b1-toxin production induced significantly more endothelial damage compared to isolates without \u03b1-toxin production.Our results are in agreement with others who reported that hla is the most common hemolysin gene in Staphylococci. Moraveji, Tabatabaei [] reported that hla is more frequently expressed by S. haemolyticus isolated from ulcers of diabetic patients. Pinheiro, Brito [] showed that the hla gene was present in 91.7% of S. haemolyticus isolates. Also, Alfatemi, Motamedifar [] showed that 93.15% S. aureus isolates were positive for the hla gene. In order to improve our knowledge of the interaction between the immune system and S. haemolyticus during the infection, we investigated the expression of IL1\u03b2, IL4, IL17, IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, TGF\u03b2 and IL10 by PBMCs infected withS. haemolyticus. S. haemolyticus and S. aureus induced human PBMCs to produce different cytokines at different relative levels after 6 and 24 hof infection.We observed a marked early inflammatory response, which is consistent with other reports that described a similar production of high levels of inflammatory mediators (IL1\u03b2, IL6, and TNF\u03b1) after S. aureus peritoneal infection []. This could be explained by the expression of different types of Toll-like receptors on PBMCs, which interacts with the bacteria and its products, leading to an increase in inflammatory cytokine release []. Similar to our observation, stimulation of the keratinocytes with S. epidermidis evoked the gene expression and release of the powerful pro-inflammatory IL1\u03b2 beta []. IL17 plays a key role in the defense of the host against different pathogens, including bacteria and viruses []. IL17 also produces a synergistic effect with other cytokines, such as IL1, IL6 and TNF\u03b1, to enhance the ability of the tissue infiltrating neutrophils to clear the extracellular pathogens []. Islander, Andersson [] reported that superantigens produced by S. aureus were efficient in stimulating IL17 release. According to our results, IL4 expression was greater than IL1. Giese, Sumner [] reported that IL4 might induce inhibitory effects on IL1\u03b2 production, resulting in a reduced level. Staphylococci also induced a marked increase in the expression of the down regulatory IL10 cytokine, particularly after 24 h, which attenuated the inflammatory response and may aid in improving the skin swelling, erythema and inflammation []. The peptidoglycan in the cell wall of Staphylococci induces the release of known immunosuppressive mediators such as IL10, PGE2, and TGF\u03b2 []. IL10 may play a protective role by inhibiting Th1 responses and blocking the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines []. Since IL10 is known to inhibit the synthesis of IFN\u03b3 as well as IL1, IL6, IL8 and TNF\u03b1. IL10 may dampen the inflammation and cytotoxic effect of these cytokines, which prevents chronic inflammation and host morbidity. On the other hand, the attenuation of the immune responses may lead to an increase in bacterialload []. We noticed that TNF levels did not increase further after 24 h of infection compared to their levels after 6 h. It is possible that the marked increase in IL10 levels hindered the further increase in TNF expression levels. We concluded that S. haemolyticus carries an inclusive set of genes that code for different virulence factors such as toxins, enzymes and adhesion proteins. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the pathomechanisms of S. haemolyticus infections and fill a gap in the literature regarding the CoNS. Based on our observations, microbiology laboratories should consider S. haemolyticus as a critical opportunistic pathogen and infections caused by this organism, particularly in critically ill patients, should be seriously managed. Additional experiments are planned to study the expression of these genes upon infection of the PHSF cells and the role of these genes in the invasion, intracellular survival and establishment of infection in the host cells. These factors may contribute to the bacteria\u2019s ability to spread through tissues and the pathological damage associated with DFU. Among the limitations of this study is the low number of tested isolates and that the all tested bacteria were obtained from only one site of infection. However, in future studies, we are planning to test the pathogenesis of more clinical strains that are collected from different sites of infection."}]},{"title":"Staphylococcus haemolyticus - an emerging threat in the twilight of the antibiotics age","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can S. haemolyticus cause?","id":"102-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"blood infections, including sepsis","answer_start":595,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Staphylococcus haemolyticus is one of the most frequent aetiological factors of staphylococcal infections. This species seems to lack the important virulence attributes described in other staphylococci. However, studies have shown that the presence of various enzymes, cytolysins and surface substances affects the virulence of S. haemolyticus. Nevertheless, none of them has been identified as crucial and determinative. Despite this, S. haemolyticus is, after Staphylococcus epidermidis, the second most frequently isolated coagulase-negative staphylococcus from clinical cases, notably from blood infections, including sepsis. This raises the question of what is the reason for the increasing clinical significance of S. haemolyticus? The most important factor might be the ability to acquire multiresistance against available antimicrobial agents, even glycopeptides. The unusual genome plasticity of S. haemolyticus strains manifested by a large number of insertion sequences and identified SNPs might contribute to its acquisition of antibiotic resistance. Interspecies transfer of SCCmec cassettes suggests that S. haemolyticus might also be the reservoir of resistance genes for other staphylococci, including Staphylococcus aureus. Taking into consideration the great adaptability and the ability to survive in the hospital environment, especially on medical devices, S. haemolyticus becomes a crucial factor in nosocomial infections caused by multiresistant staphylococci.

These microorganisms usually infect premature neonates and immunocompromised patients, particularly those hospitalized for chemotherapy and managed with indwelling devices such as central venous catheters (1, 2). The ability to form biofilm on the surfaces of inserted devices is the most important virulence mechanism of CoNS. Research on biofilm formation in Staphylococcus epidermidis started relatively early and has served as a model for other staphylococci, including Staphylococcus aureus and other CoNS species. In contrast to S. epidermidis, S. capitis displays the biofilm-forming capacity under particular experimental conditions, for example, in medium with high osmolarity. Quantitative biofilm production is linearly induced by sodium chloride (3). Polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) is the best-studied factor involved in S. epidermidis biofilm formation. It consists of glycan of \u03b2-1,6-linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosyl subunits, and its synthesis has been shown to be essential for S. epidermidis virulence. The ica operon encodes for proteins that synthesize PIA and includes the icaA, icaD, icaB, and icaC genes, in that order, downstream from the icaA promoter that controls expression of the entire operon. In addition, a regulatory gene called icaR is located upstream and is transcribed in the opposite direction (4). Other surface molecules involved in the accumulation phase of biofilm formation include accumulation-associated protein (Aap) (5), extracellular matrix-binding protein (Embp) (6), and extracellular DNA (7). Aap is a 220-kDa LPXTG protein (8). Embp was recently found to be a multifunctional cell surface protein that mediates attachment to host extracellular matrix, biofilm accumulation, and escape from phagocytosis (9). Staphylococcus capitis has been implicated in biofilm-related infections such as endocarditis (10), urinary tract infection (11), and catheter-related bacteremia (12). Humans are likely to be the main sources or vehicles of transmission of S. capitis (13). Several reports suggest that S. capitis is an emerging opportunistic pathogen in newborn babies being cared for in newborn intensive care units (NICUs) (14\u201316). This species has been endemic in the NICU of the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, for several years, and we have accumulated a collection of isolates from neonates believed to have bloodstream infections with this species. S. capitis can be further divided into two subspecies: subsp. urealyticus and subsp. capitis. Subspecies urealyticus can be distinguished from subsp. capitis by its urease activity, ability to produce acid from maltose in anaerobic conditions, fatty acid profile, larger colony size, and DNA sequence differentiation (17). Since no previous study has examined the prevalence, phenotypic characteristics, and molecular epidemiology of the two subspecies of S. capitis as opportunistic pathogens in NICUs, our aim was to characterize our collection of isolates, with respect to subspecies, antimicrobial susceptibility, structure of the ica operon, and expression of the biofilm phenotype under conditions of stress. We hypothesize that the two subspecies differ in prevalence and in their capacity to become opportunistic pathogens in NICUs."}]}]},{"species":"Staphylococcus lugdunensis","docs":[{"title":"Staphylococcus lugdunensis Infections of the Skin and Soft Tissue: A Case Series and Review","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether S. lugdunensis is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"106-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-positive","answer_start":70,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does S. lugdunensis normally exist?","id":"106-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"skin","answer_start":140,"id":1},{"text":"skin","answer_start":1705,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can S. lugdunensis cause?","id":"106-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"skin and soft tissue infections","answer_start":230,"id":1},{"text":"skin and soft tissue infections","answer_start":584,"id":2},{"text":"skin and soft tissue infections","answer_start":1767,"id":3},{"text":"skin infections","answer_start":348,"id":4},{"text":"skin infections","answer_start":942,"id":5}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Staphylococcus lugdunensis (S. lugdunensis) is a coagulase-negative, Gram-positive bacterium that can be isolated as a component of normal skin flora in humans.

Coagulase is an enzyme produced by many bacteria that allows the conversion of prothrombin to staphylothrombin, which in turn activates the protease activity of thrombin. Activated thrombin catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and other coagulation-related reactions resulting in the clotting of the blood [2, 3]. Although controversial, it has been postulated that the localized clotting elicited by coagulase can serve as a shield that protects the microorganism from the patient\u2019s immune and phagocytic defenses [3]. Coagulase-positive microorganisms tend to be considered pathogens and are traditionally associated with S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible strains. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are not able to produce coagulase and are typically considered a component of the normal flora of the skin; they are not usually considered to be pathogens.  Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus. It was first described by Freney et al. [4]. It is typically considered part of the normal skin flora. Recently, S. lugdunensis has been implicated as the main pathogen in a variety of infections, including central nervous system infections, endocarditis, endophthalmitis, osteomyelitis, peritonitis, prosthetic joint infections, urinary tract infections, and systemic infections [1, 5, 6]. In addition, an increasing number of the infections caused by S. lugdunensis are skin and soft tissue infections [1, 6, 7]. Herchline and Ayers [7] performed a study involving 143 patients over a period of 63 months; they examined the occurrence of S. lugdunensis in cultures originating from 155 specimens isolated from all parts of the body. The skin and skin structures represented about 55% of the clinical diagnosis of S. lugdunensis infections, and most of those samples originated from patients\u2019 abscesses, cellulitis, or wounds. Five patients (one woman and four men) developed S. lugdunensis related-skin infections from February 19, 2015 to May 30, 2017 (Table 1). The patients\u2019 ages during the onset of the infection ranged from 30 to 82 years; the median age was 70 years. Four of the patients were older than 65 years. The bacterial cultures from the five patients grew S. lugdunensis. In addition to S. lugdunensis, the bacterial culture from the 30-year-old man grew two other organisms: S. aureus and S. agalactiae (Streptococcus group B). Also, the bacterial culture of the 80-year-old woman grew one additional organism: S. intermedius. Similar to our two patients whose infections contained not only S. lugdunensis but also other organisms, Herchline and Ayers [7] noted that 60% of the cultures of specimens from their patients infected with S. lugdunensis also grew other microorganisms. Some of these organisms were pathogenic bacteria that can be associated with mixed infections, whereas others were bacteria that reflected the location of the lesion and included some common components of the skin flora [7]. The back was the most common location for the S. lugdunensis infection, followed by the digits. All of the sites of infection clinically presented as cellulitis. Some had an underlying infected cyst, whereas others had abscess of the nail fold. The lesions were incised or spontaneously ruptured. The initial clinical impression for all of the patients favored an infection caused by S. aureus, which is a prevalent pathogen in our practice. Therefore, all patients were initially treated with antibiotics that would cover methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. Similar to our patients, Bocher et al. [1] also observed that skin and soft tissue infections caused by S. lugdunensis are clinically indistinguishable from those caused by S. aureus.  Staphylococcus lugdunensis can also causes infection in patients with intact immunity. However, three patients were receiving immunosuppressive therapy when their infections occurred. Similarly, the studies provided by Herchline and Ayers [7] also noted that 50% of S. lugdunensis infections occurred in patients who were immunosuppressed or had a prior history of trauma to the site. The susceptibilities of the cultured strains of S. lugdunensis demonstrated that all of the organisms were sensitive to cefazolin, which is similar to observations made in patients with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infections. Two patients were treated with cephalexin only. The other patients were treated with the following antibiotics: cephalexin and doxycycline or cefdinir and doxycycline or cephalexin and sulfamethoxazole\u2013trimethoprim (Table 1). The patients were treated from 10 to 30 days until complete healing. There was no recurrence of the infection 2 months following treatment. One limitation of our case series of S. lugdunenesis skin and soft tissue infections is that our methodology is prone to selection bias. The cases were retrospectively selected from among the patients evaluated by bacterial culture during a time period of 27 months. A prospective study in which all patients with suspected skin and soft tissue infections are consecutively screened for inclusion during a predefined time period could provide information on the incidence of skin and soft tissue infections of S. lugdunenesis as compared to those of other pathogenic bacteria."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Staphylococcus lugdunensis normally exist?","id":"106-1-4-1","answers":[{"text":"skin","answer_start":109,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can S. lugdunensis cause?","id":"106-1-4-2","answers":[{"text":"skin and soft tissue infections","answer_start":167,"id":1},{"text":"skin and soft tissue infections","answer_start":281,"id":2},{"text":"skin and soft tissue infections","answer_start":746,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Staphylococcus lugdunensis was previously considered a nonpathogenic organism and a component of the normal skin flora.

This review article underscores the important points in the literature about S. lugdunensis infections, including its epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment, as well as specific types of infections it can cause. Anatomical and age-related distributions of S. lugdunensis SSTIs have been noted, though they most commonly occur as abscesses. S. lugdunensis can also manifest as an aggressive form of IE presenting with valve destruction and abscess formation, frequently requiring surgery and with a high mortality rate. Bone and joint infections caused by S. lugdunensis are also more invasive than infections by other species of CNS. The clinical presentation of S. lugdunensis infection in SSTI, IE, and bone\/joint infection is frequently more similar to that of S. aureus infection than that of other CNS infections, necessitating species-level differentiation of CNS for proper diagnosis. Though historically, this depended upon biochemical tests that were neither routine nor reliable, the implementation of matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) in clinical laboratories has made identification of CNS species such as S. lugdunensis more practical. Imaging modalities, especially the fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) with positron emission tomography (PET), are another important emerging trend in the diagnosis of infectious diseases such as S. lugdunensis infection. S. lugdunensis remains highly susceptible to a wide gamut of antibacterial therapies, which is uncharacteristic of other CNS. Infections can usually be treated by antibiotics traditionally used for CNS such as oxacillin. The breakpoints for S. lugdunensis are higher than those of other CNS and similar to S. aureus breakpoints. In the case of aggressive IE or bone\/joint infection by S. lugdunensis, it is recommended to treat with a \u03b2-lactam agent. Further study is needed to understand the diversity, virulence, and population structure of this species, as well as its role in other infections, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), respiratory infections, peritonitis, and bacteremia.

Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Study at two centres (a tertiary care centre and a community hospital). Patients: 10 patients with IE caused by S lugdunensis in 912 consecutive patients with IE between 1990 and 2003. Methods: Prospective study of consecutive patients carried out by the multidisciplinary team for diagnosis and treatment of IE from the study institutions. English, French, and Spanish literature was searched by computer under the terms \u201cendocarditis\u201d and \u201cStaphylococcus lugdunensis\u201d published between 1989 and December 2003. Main outcome measures: Patient characteristics, echocardiographic findings, required surgery, and prognostic factors of mortality in left sided cases of IE. Results: 10 cases of IE caused by S lugdunensis were identified at our institutions, representing 0.8% (four of 467), 1.5% (two of 135), and 7.8% (four of 51) of cases of native valve, prosthetic valve, and pacemaker lead endocarditis in the non-drug misusers. Native valve IE was present in four patients (two aortic, one mitral, and one pulmonary), prosthetic valve aortic IE in two patients, and pacemaker lead IE in the other four patients. All patients with left sided IE had serious complications (heart failure, periannular abscess formation, or shock) requiring surgery in 60% (three of five patients) of cases with an overall mortality rate of 80% (four of five patients). All patients with pacemaker IE underwent combined medical treatment and surgery, and mortality was 25% (one patient). In total 59 cases of IE caused by S lugdunensis were identified in a review of the literature. The combined analysis of these 69 cases showed that native valve IE (53 patients, 77%) is characterised by mitral valve involvement and frequent complications such as heart failure, abscess formation, and embolism. Surgery was needed in 51% of cases and mortality was 42%. Prosthetic valve endocarditis (nine of 60, 13%) predominated in the aortic position and was associated with abscess formation, required surgery, and high mortality (78%). Pacemaker lead IE (seven of 69, 10%) is associated with a better prognosis when antibiotic treatment is combined with surgery. Conclusions: S lugdunensis IE is an uncommon cause of IE, involving mainly native left sided valves, and it is characterised by an aggressive clinical course. Mortality in left sided native valve IE is high but the prognosis has improved in recent years. Surgery has improved survival in left sided IE and, therefore, early surgery should always be considered. Prosthetic valve S lugdunensis IE carries an ominous prognosis."}]}]},{"species":"Campylobacter rectus","docs":[{"title":"Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis due to Campylobacter rectus infection","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Campylobacter rectus cause?","id":"107-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"septic cavernous sinus thrombosis","answer_start":371,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" We report a case of cavernous sinus thrombosis in a 55-year-old Chinese man who presented with headache, ophthalmoplegia and ptosis.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in pediatric practice. Its pathogenesis involves complex interactions between bacteria, viruses, and the host inflammatory response.

AOM is often considered to be a bacterial infection, but its pathogenesis actually involves complex interactions among viruses and bacteria [6]. In most children who develop AOM, viral infection of the upper respiratory tract initiates the cascade of events that finally leads to this condition [17]. Inflammation of the nasopharynx and Eustachian tube caused by viruses may allow bacteria to infect the middle ear. In the present patient, C. rectus could not be isolated by conventional culture at clinical laboratory in our hospital. However, we identified C. rectus by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and excluded the major bacterial and viral pathogens of AOM by PCR, RT-PCR, or real-time PCR. As a result, C. rectus was found to be the causative organism of severe AOM in this patient. C. rectus is difficult to culture and identify. It requires anaerobic conditions for optimal isolation, although the reported composition of the atmosphere needed for successful culture varies among authors [1]. Mahlene et al. obtained the isolate at the same culture conditions with us after 7 days incubation [1]. The supposable reasons why we could not obtain the isolate in spite of the same culture condition of the literature might be attributed to the prior administration of antimicrobial or short time cultivation time. Currently, identification of C. rectus is based on analysis of 16S rRNA. For clinical diagnosis of C. rectus infections, routine methods allowing accurate identification by microbiological laboratories are needed. It has been reported that C. rectus is typically isolated from the oral cavity, and it was found in 50\u201394.6% of oral samples from children [2], [18]. Familial transmission of oral bacteria is generally accepted [18] and it had been recently suggested that oral bacteria could also be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs. Kato et al. reported that 92.3% of pet dogs analyzed in Japan had C. rectus in their oral flora [19]. In addition, Yamasaki et al. found that 66.7% of companion dogs and 21.0% of their owners were positive for C. rectus in oral samples [20]. C. rectus was detected in fecal samples of healthy or diarrheic pet dogs [21], and the fecal-oral transmission might be one of the possible rote. Because the present patient had dogs, it may be suggested that the origin of C. rectus infection was his companion pets. The route of spread was suspected to be from the oral cavity via the Eustachian tube to the middle ear. To clarify the relationship between C. rectus and AOM, further clinical and epidemiological studies among this organism, human and pet animals are needed. Only seven cases of C. rectus infection have been reported in the English literature (Table 1 ). The present patient had several different characteristics from the previous 7 cases. First, all of the previous patients were adults, while this patient was an adolescent. Second, the previous patients had underlying diseases, while this patient had no predisposing factors except for keeping pets. Third, culture was positive in all of the previous patients, while it was negative in this case, although this may have been related to prior antimicrobial therapy. We previously reported that 16S rRNA gene analysis was useful in patients with culture negative infection [7], and we employed this technique to identify the microorganism in the middle ear fluid of this patient. Although 7\/8 cases, including this patient, responded to surgery and\/or antimicrobial therapy, it is noteworthy that one patient died of ruptured intracranial mycotic aneurysm. Thus, C. rectus infections can occur in previously healthy young people and are occasionally fatal, and C. rectus is a potential causative pathogen of culture negative AOM. Therefore, further investigation of this microorganism in patients with AOM seems to be warranted. Cases of Campylobacter rectus infection. Treatment of complicated infections due to C. rectus usually requires surgical drainage with prolonged antibiotic therapy [22]. There are limited antimicrobial susceptibility data for C. rectus, and there is no standard antibiotic regimen for infections due to this bacterium. One study showed that C. rectus was sensitive to imipenem, levofloxacin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole, with beta-lactamase activity not being detected [22]. The present patient recovered after receiving intravenous ampicillin and oral amoxicillin, so C. rectus may have been susceptible to penicillin in this case. In conclusion, we described the first patient with AOM due to C. rectus infection detected by 16S rRNA gene analysis. This case suggests that C. rectus may be a possible causative pathogen of AOM. Accordingly, we need to perform culture while taking C. rectus into consideration in patients with AOM, and methods for its accurate identification by clinical microbiological laboratories are required. For adequate treatment of C. rectus infection, antibiotic selection guidelines and surveillance of its antimicrobial susceptibility profile are also required. Further clinical and epidemiological studies will be needed to clarify the relationship between C. rectus and AOM. Nucleotide sequence accession number.

A majority of the Campylobacter species are microaerophiles, while some require anaerobic conditions for their growth (Debruyne et al., 2008). Most Campylobacter species live as normal flora in the gastrointestinal tract of various animals (Lastovica et al., 2014). Some of these animal hosted Campylobacter species, such as Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, can cause acute bacterial gastroenteritis in humans through consumption of contaminated food or water (Galanis, 2007). In addition to gastroenteritis, C. jejuni also causes Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, due to molecular mimicry between its sialylated lipooligosaccharides and the human nerve gangliosides (Takahashi et al., 2005). As C. jejuni and C. coli are the main Campylobacter pathogens which cause human acute intestinal disease and they originate from animal sources, Campylobacteriosis has historically been considered to be zoonotic. Several Campylobacter species utilize humans as their natural host and accumulated evidence supports their role in chronic inflammatory diseases of the human intestinal tract. Here we review recent advancements on human hosted Campylobacter species, their clinical relevance, transmission, virulence factors, disease associated genes, interactions with human immune system and pathogenic mechanisms. Most of the studies on the human hosted Campylobacter species in the past decade were on Campylobacter concisus, this bacterium is therefore the focus of this review. In addition, other human hosted Campylobacter species were also reviewed."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can C. concisus cause?","id":"108-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"human CD","answer_start":341,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Accumulated evidence from the past decade supports the role of human hosted C. concisus in the development of IBD and possibly Barrett's esophagus and GERD.

Historically, C. concisus was associated with the human oral cavity and has been linked with periodontal lesions, including gingivitis and periodontitis, although currently its role as an oral pathogen remains contentious. Evidence to support the role of C. concisus in acute intestinal disease has come from studies that have detected or isolated C. concisus as sole pathogen in fecal samples from diarrheic patients. C. concisus has also been associated with chronic intestinal disease, its prevalence being significantly higher in children with newly diagnosed Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) and adults with ulcerative colitis than in controls. Further C. concisus has been isolated from biopsy specimens of patients with CD. While such studies support the role of C. concisus as an intestinal pathogen, its isolation from healthy individuals, and failure of some studies to show a significant difference in C. concisus prevalence in subjects with diarrhea and healthy controls has raised contention as to its role in intestinal disease. Such findings could argue against the role of C. concisus in intestinal disease, however, the fact that C. concisus strains are genetically diverse raises the possibility that differences exist in their pathogenic potential. Evidence to support this view comes from studies showing strain specific differences in the ability of C. concisus to attach to and invade cells and produce virulence factors, including toxins and hemolytic phospholipase A. Further, sequencing of the genome of a C. concisus strain isolated from a child with CD (UNSWCD) and comparison of this with the only other fully sequenced strain (BAA-1457) would suggest that major differences exist in the genetic make-up of this species which could explain different outcomes of C. concisus infection."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Campylobacter concisus is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"108-2-2-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":1819,"id":1},{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":2262,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can C. concisus cause?","id":"108-2-2-2","answers":[{"text":"intestinal disease, including enteritis and more recently inflammatory bowel diseases","answer_start":3289,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Campylobacter concisus's requirement for oxygen?","id":"108-2-2-3","answers":[{"text":"microaerophilic","answer_start":2245,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Campylobacter concisus?","id":"108-2-2-4","answers":[{"text":"rods","answer_start":2277,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Members of the Campylobacter genus are fastidious Gram-negative spiral or curved shaped rods, which grow under microaerobic or anaerobic conditions. The majority of species are motile, having a single polar flagellum at one or both ends of the cell (Vandamme et al., 2005; Man, 2011). The most well-studied species of the Campylobacter genus is the intestinal pathogen Campylobacter jejuni, a bacterium currently recognized as the leading cause of acute diarrhea and gastroenteritis worldwide, accounting for 400 million cases of gastroenteritis in adults and children each year (Blaser et al., 1983; Tauxe et al., 1987; Allos, 2001). Additionally in a small number of those acutely infected with C. jejuni a number of serious sequelae can occur including Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome and reactive arthritis (Altekruse et al., 1999). In addition to C. jejuni, C. coli has also been recognized as an important cause of gastroenteritis accounting for 5\u201318.6% of cases of gastroenteritis caused by Campylobacter spp. (Friedman et al., 2004; Valenza et al., 2010). While from a clinical perspective C. jejuni and C. coli are major foci of attention worldwide, over the last decade mounting evidence has accrued that would suggest that other members of the Campylobacter genus including C. concisus, C. gracilis, C. upsaliensis, and C. lari may also play a role in intestinal disease. While evidence to support the role of each of these four non-jejuni\/coli Campylobacter species in intestinal disease is increasing (a recent review by Man, 2011 provides a comprehensive reference source for the clinical importance of emerging Campylobacter species), evidence for the role of C. concisus is perhaps the most contentious. Campylobacter concisus was first isolated and named by Tanner et al. (1981). In a study, which compared 46 Gram-negative, asaccharolytic, rod shaped bacteria isolated from humans with periodontal disease with 10 reference strains including Eikenella corrodens, Vibrio succinogenes (now known as Wolinella succinogenes), Bacteroides ureolyticus (now known as C. ureolyticus), and Campylobacter species, Tanner et al. (1981) identified six isolates from patients with gingivitis and periodontitis that were described as non-corroding, microaerophilic, Gram-negative, rods predominantly curved in shape, with deoxyribonucleic acid guanine-plus-cytosine contents of 34\u201338%, which they proposed should be named \u201cCampylobacter concisus sp. nov.\u201d (type strain, ATCC 33237). Although it is now 30 years since Tanner and colleagues first named C. concisus, advances in our understanding of the required growth conditions, phenotypic characteristics (Table \u200b(Table1;1; Tanner et al., 1981; Vandamme et al., 2005), genetic make-up, and pathogenic potential of C. concisus have been relatively slow, and somewhat sporadic, with only approximately 80 papers relating to C. concisus being published over the last 30 years. Phenotypic characteristics of Campylobacter concisus. *A, 95\u2013100% positive; M, 60\u201393% positive; F, 14\u201350% positive; N, 0\u201311% positive; not available, Trace quantities. While initially studies focused upon the role of C. concisus in periodontal disease, over the last 20 years the major research focus has predominantly been investigation of the role of C. concisus in intestinal disease, including enteritis and more recently inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Although a relatively large number of studies have examined the relationship between C. concisus and intestinal disease there still remains no consensus as to its role. By enlarge, this relates to the fact that in many studies no significant difference was detected between the prevalence of C. concisus in those with intestinal disease and healthy controls (Van Etterijck et al., 1996; Lawson et al., 1998; Inglis et al., 2011). While these findings per se would argue against such a link, the fact that there is an extremely high degree of genetic heterogeneity among C. concisus strains raises the possibility that only some C. concisus strains have the ability to cause intestinal disease. Given this, a number of studies have attempted to link specific genomospecies of C. concisus with disease outcome, however, although some progress has been made in this area no specific C. concisus genomospecies has been associated with disease outcome. This review aims to provide an overview of our current understanding of the association between C. concisus and oral and intestinal disease, the importance of genetic diversity and its association with disease outcome, the pathogenic potential of C. concisus, as well as potential reservoirs of infection and susceptibility to antibiotics."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can C. concisus cause?","id":"108-2-3-1","answers":[{"text":"periodontal diseases, acute enteritis, and IBDs","answer_start":334,"id":1},{"text":"acute and chronic intestinal diseases","answer_start":423,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Significant advances in our understanding of C. concisus have occurred over the last 5 years with over a third of studies on C. concisus published within this time period.

In 1991, Vandamme et al. first proposed that Bacteroides ureolyticus should be reclassified as a member of the Campylobacter genus (29). According to Vandamme et al., B. ureolyticus fell into the rRNA cluster that contains members of the Campylobacter genus (29). Follow-up studies by the same group showed through polyphasic taxonomic analyses that B. ureolyticus shared (i) respiratory quinone content, (ii) DNA base ratio, and (iii) phenotypic characteristics with Campylobacter species, including Campylobacter jejuni (26). In a subsequent study, however, Vandamme et al. reported differences with respect to (i) fatty acid composition, (ii) proteolytic metabolism, (iii) hydrolysis of gelatin and casein, and (iv) ability to hydrolyze urea (28). In 2010, a publication by Vandamme et al. (27) finally acknowledged and verified the reclassification of B. ureolyticus to Campylobacter ureolyticus comb. nov., a newly designated member of the Campylobacter genus. Prior to reclassification, the isolation of C. ureolyticus was reported from patients with a range of diseases, including superficial ulcers, soft tissue infections, nongonococcal urethritis, perianal abscess, and gangrenous lesions. The bacteria has also been reported to be present in amniotic fluid and the genital tract of humans (5\u20138). In addition, C. ureolyticus has commonly been isolated from patients suffering from periodontal disease, a disease which involves inflammatory and destructive conditions of the tissues surrounding the teeth (6). C. ureolyticus has also been isolated from biopsy samples of children with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease (CD) (32), one of two categorical subtype diseases within inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The fact that such a bacterium was successfully isolated from these biopsy samples raises the question as to whether C. ureolyticus could potentially play a role in intestinal diseases or, alternatively, whether it is simply part of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract. Given this, we recently conducted studies to investigate the pathogenic potential of C. ureolyticus and showed that the bacterium when cultured with human monocytes and primary macrophages initiated the production of inflammatory cytokines (18). While this suggests that C. ureolyticus may have the potential to cause intestinal disease, it does not identify the bacterial factors involved or what effect contact with this bacterium has on human intestinal cells. In this study, we examined the pathogenic potential of C. ureolyticus by quantifying and visualizing the adherence and invasive abilities of this bacterium through adherence and gentamicin protection (invasion) assays and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Considering that the two prime proinflammatory cytokines associated with IBD include tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3) (30, 31), we investigated the pathogenic potential of C. ureolyticus under the effect of preexisting inflammation.

Cells are typically between 0.5 to 5 microns in length, 0.2 to 0.9 microns in width, and are motile, typically via a polar unsheathed flagellum at one or both ends. Campylobacter generally demonstrate microaerophilic metabolic characteristics, but there are also species that are capable of growth in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The term campylobacteriosis is used to describe the infectious disease that arises as a result of Campylobacter infection. Campylobacter are a leading bacterial cause of zoonotic disease worldwide and are considered a foodborne pathogen. Campylobacter related illness affects approximately 1% of the European population per annum, causing infection in 13 in every 100 000 individuals in the US each year and, as such, are a major public health concern. The incubation period associated with campylobacteriosis tends to last between one and seven days, followed by the onset of the symptoms which can last from three days to a week. Symptoms include abdominal cramping, fever and diarrhea, with or without blood in the stools and in most cases the infection is self-limiting. Campylobacter related infections can also lead to the onset of post infection complications including Guillian Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) or Miller Fischer Syndrome (MFS). GBS is a self-limiting autoimmune disorder of the peripheral nervous system associated with weakness of the limbs, respiratory muscles, and areflexia. Similarly MFS is associated with ataxia, opthalmoplegia, areflexia, and is a subform of GBS. It is estimated that the annual incidence of campylobacteriosis costs the US between $1.3 to 6.8 billion dollars and thus is a significant economic burden. This is likely to be an underestimate as it does not consider indirect costs such as liabilities, both physical and psychological, that are associated with Campylobacter-induced GBS. The two predominant causative agents of Campylobacter related infections are C. jejuni and C. coli. However, recent studies have identified another species of Campylobacter that appears to have a much more significant role in human campylobacteriosis than previously realized. Campylobacter ureolyticus has been identified by our group as an emerging gastrointestinal pathogen. This organism, like other members of the species, is a gram-negative, anaerobic, non-sporing bacillus.C. ureolyticus is aflagellate as opposed to some of the more virulent species including C. jejuni, which possess flagella. C. ureolyticus was first identified as Bacteroides corrodens, owing to its ability to produce \u201ccorroding\u201d colonies, from isolates taken from buccal abscesses by Eiken. In order to differentiate between the facultative and strictly anaerobic strains Jackson and Goodman subsequently classified them as a separate genera reserving B. corrodens for the anaerobes. The authors recommended the name B. ureolyticus for the strict anaerobes to avoid any confusion with the facultative species which had been given the name Eikenella corrodens.B. ureolyticus remained the commonly used name for the organism until Vandamme et al. concluded that there was insufficient evidence to reclassify B. ureolyticus as a member of the Campylobacter genus. The organism thus remained a species incertae sedis and remained as such for a further 15 y. In 2010 Vandamme again reviewed the situation; this time completing the reclassification to C. ureolyticus on the basis of an array of evidence, including a 16S rRNA sequence similarity within the range of 91\u201393% to the species of the genus Campylobacter. The six B. ureolyticus strains investigated showed >99% similarity with respect to each other using the same phylogenetic anchor. This has led to the formal reclassification of B. ureolyticus as C. ureolyticus."}]},{"title":"Genomic investigation into strain heterogeneity and pathogenic potential of the emerging gastrointestinal pathogen Campylobacter ureolyticus","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can C. ureolyticus cause?","id":"110-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"superficial ulcers, gangrenous lesions, nongonococcal urethritis, bacterial vaginosis, and of late, male infertility","answer_start":1404,"id":1},{"text":"periodontal lesions, including gingivitis and peridontitis","answer_start":1665,"id":2},{"text":"emerging gastrointestinal pathogen","answer_start":3291,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of C. ureolyticus?","id":"110-3-1-2","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic","answer_start":2307,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Within the last decade a growing number of atypical Campylobacter species have been reported as emerging human pathogens [1]. Traditionally, C. jejuni and C. coli have been the main species associated with human illness, however advances in molecular diagnostics coupled with the development of novel culture techniques have facilitated the detection and isolation of a range of under reported and highly fastidious Campylobacter species [2], [3], including C. concisus and more recently C. ureolyticus [4], [5].  C. ureolyticus (previously Bacteroides ureolyticus) has only recently been classified within the Campylobacter genus [6]. Although in 1991, Vandamme et al. proposed that B. ureolyticus be reclassified as a member of the Campylobacter genus [7], its fatty acid profile and hydrolysis of gelatin and casein differentiated this organism from other Campylobacter species and B. ureolyticus remained as \u2018species incertae sedis\u2019 [6], [8], [9]. Almost two decades later, employing a polypahsic approach, Vandamme and colleagues reported that B. ureolyticus shared (i) respiratory quinone content, (ii) DNA base ratio, and (iii) phenotypic characteristics with Campylobacter species, including Campylobacter jejuni and resulted in the reclassification of Bacteroides ureolyticus as Campylobacter ureolyticus [6]. Historically, C. ureolyticus has been associated with a range of diseases, including superficial ulcers, gangrenous lesions, nongonococcal urethritis, bacterial vaginosis, and of late, male infertility [6], [10], [11], [12]. Furthermore, analogous to several other emerging and atypical Campylobacter species, C. ureolyticus has been linked with periodontal lesions, including gingivitis and peridontitis [2], [13], [14]. Recent work has led to the detection and subsequent isolation of C. ureolyticus as the sole pathogen from faecal samples of diarrheic patients [4], [15], [16]. Using a species specific PCR (targeting the hsp60 gene), C. ureolyticus is now believed to be the second most common Campylobacter species detected in diarrhoeic patients surpassing the established pathogen C. coli and exceeded only by C. jejuni [13]. Additionally, analysis of infectivity data reveals a predominance of C. ureolyticus in patients at extremes of age (<5 years and >70 years) suggesting an opportunistic nature for the pathogen [17]. Furthermore, we have noted a seasonal prevalence and have identified potential reservoirs of infection [18]. Following our initial report, C. ureolyticus has been detected at significantly higher rates in patients with Ulcerative Colitis (21.7%) in comparison to healthy controls (3.1%) [19]. In support of this, a New South Wales study [20], report the detection and isolation of C. ureolyticus from biopsy specimens and faecal samples from children with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease (CD). This group later report on the pathogenic potential of C. ureolyticus: observing that their strain C. ureolyticus UNSWCD was capable of colonizing and adhering to intestinal cells - resulting in cellular damage and microvillus degradation [21]. As such, the recent emergence of C. ureolyticus in patients with gastrointestinal illness, at higher levels than the healthy controls, provides a compelling case that C. ureolyticus is likely to be an emerging gastrointestinal pathogen of some importance. Despite the growing evidence to suggest that non-C. jejuni\/C. coli species are significant contributors to human disease [2], [15], [22], our existing understanding of Campylobacter pathogenesis is essentially restricted to C. jejuni. Furthermore, the literature regarding the mechanisms of C. jejuni invasion is highly controversial, whereby some groups report the paracellular route and others described the transcellular model or a mix of both [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. In general, the past decade has provided us with substantial findings, revealing many of the virulence components of C. jejuni [28], however the exact mechanism of its pathology is as yet still unclear [29], [30]. The small, curved shape of this Gram-negative bacterium, coupled with flagella-mediated motility, allow C. jejuni to penetrate intestinal mucus [31], where it can then adhere to epithelial cells via various surface associated adhesions, such as CadF and FlpA, which mediate binding to host tissue fibronectin [32]. Once attached, the bacterium then employs a range of secretion systems including the flagellar type III, the type IV and the recently identified type VI [33], [34], [35], [36], through which it secretes invasion antigens, such as CiaB, which may promote cellular invasion of the intestinal epithelial cells [37] . Furthermore, C. jejuni produces various toxins including CdtA-C, which have been reported to promote cellular cytotoxicity and apoptotic cell death [31]. More recently, whole genome investigation followed by in vitro analysis of the emerging gastrointestinal pathogen C. concisus revealed potential components contributing to the organism's pathogenesis; including several toxins, invasins in addition to colonisation, and adhesion factors [5], [31], [38], [39]. Studies by Man et al. [26] report that in addition to a transcellular route of invasion, C. concisus UNSWCD preferentially attaches to intercellular junctional spaces facilitating translocation across the epithelium, thus promoting a paracellular route of invasion [20], [40]. A likely reason for our current lack of knowledge regarding pathogenic mechanisms of C. ureolyticus is the lack of genomic data: until now the potential virulence apparatus of C. ureolyticus has remained unknown. Herein, we provide the first whole genome analysis of two C. ureolyticus strains. A comparative bioinformatics based approach was performed to identify putative virulence factors, secreted proteins and genomic heterogeneity of the two C. ureolyticus isolates in an investigation of the pathogenic mechanisms of this emerging pathogen."}]}]},{"species":"Campylobacter mucosalis","docs":[{"title":"Two cases of Campylobacter mucosalis enteritis in children","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Campylobacter mucosalis cause?","id":"111-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"enteritis","answer_start":38,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Two cases of Campylobacter mucosalis enteritis in children are reported.

Lesser-known species in the genus such as  C. curvus  are emerging as potential pathogens causing human disease.  C. curvus  is a non-fermenting, oxidase positive, microaerophilic Gram-negative bacillus that produces pinpoint colonies on blood agar when cultured under microaerophilic conditions [7]. Further biochemical characteristics of  C. curvus  are shown in Table 1. Isolation of  C. curvus  in human samples outside the oral cavity is rare and its relationship to human pathology is poorly understood [3]. Found as commensal bacteria in the human mouth, notably periodontal pockets of diseased gums, a causal role for these organisms in periodontal disease has not been clearly established [14].

Humans are known hosts to  C. curvus  with rates of carriage presumed low. One study of human faecal specimens investigating presumed gastroenteritis identified  C. curvus  in only one of 320 samples [15]. In a similar microbiome study,  C. curvus  DNA from intestinal biopsies was found in only 1.4 and 4.6 % of patients with ulcerative colitis and healthy controls respectively [16].  C. curvus  as a cause of infectious diarrhoea is rare with  C. curvus  isolated in only 0.0004\u20130.05 % of children with infectious gastroenteritis [3, 17]. This was similar to another study of infectious diarrhoea whereby  C. curvus  was isolated in only 15 patients over a 4 year period [7]. Extra-oral infection with  C. curvus  is rare. A search of the literature using the PubMed and EMBASE library databases for articles on  C. curvus  that have been published to date was conducted. Search terms included \u2018 Campylobacter curvus \u2019 OR \u2018 Wolinella curva \u2019. Twenty-three and sixty-three results based on these terms were found in the PubMed and Embase databases respectively with only five case reports of extra-oral infection, comprising two cases of liver abscesses, two cases of pulmonary infection and a case of chorioamnionitis (Table 2) [8\u201311].

All five cases prior to this report required molecular detection methods for identification of  C. curvus  with 16S rRNA sequencing the main method used. Three cases with infected collections were polymicrobial and in the case of C. curvus-associated chorioamnionitis, Haemophilus parainfluenza was also detected via molecular methods. In contrast to predominantly monomicrobial infections with C. foetus,  C. curvus  appears to exhibit co-habitation with other bacteria leading to polymicrobial infection similar to  C. showae  [13, 18]. Whilst  C. curvus  was the only pathogen isolated in this patient\u2019s collection, this may be attributable to pre-treatment with antibiotics or selective pressures from previous therapy. Whilst prior studies relied on molecular techniques to identify  C. curvus , the isolate from this study was identified using MALDI-TOF MS with a high probability score. MALDI-TOF MS correctly identifies up to 91 and 83 % of all non-jejuni\/coli Campylobacter strains and  C. curvus  isolates respectively [19]. The isolate demonstrated identification of  C. curvus  with a score of 2.143 suggesting a high probability match. Whole-genome sequencing was used to confirm speciation and based on the genomic context from pan-genomes against other  Campylobacter  spp., the isolate appeared most related to  C. curvus  (Fig. 4). Phylogenetic tree of isolate recovered from the reported case with other known  Campylobacter  species. The maximum likelihood tree was constructed using alignment of gene-to-gene comparison. Susceptibility testing and antibiotic MIC reports for  C. curvus  strains are limited due to the rarity of the infection. Reported MICs in the literature are variable but include: bacitracin >128 \u00b5g ml, ceftriaxone >32 \u00b5g ml, cefuroxime >256 \u00b5g ml, chloramphenicol 2\u20134 \u00b5g ml, ciprofloxacin 0.047 \u00b5g ml, clindamycin 0.5\u20131 \u00b5g ml, erythromycin 2 \u00b5g ml, gentamicin 2 \u00b5g ml, metronidazole 0.38\u20132 \u00b5g ml, and penicillin 32 \u00b5g ml [4, 8]. Susceptibility to \u03b2-lactams in  Campylobacter  spp are variable with minimal data in particular to piperacillin-tazobactam [20]. One study examining C.  coli \/C.  jejuni  found low resistance to amoxicillin but high resistance to piperacillin thought secondary to poor penetration due to the bulky side chain in the latter [21]. E-test diffusion testing of the isolate demonstrated an MIC of 0.19 \u00b5g ml for ciprofloxacin and 16 \u00b5g ml for erythromycin. Although interpretation for these MIC values is not available for non-jejuni\/coli Campylobacter spp due to limited data on  C. curvus , we interpreted the isolate to be ciprofloxacin susceptible and erythromycin resistant by extrapolating EUCAST breakpoints for C. jejuni\/C. coli species [22]. No gene could be detected in the draft genome that would confer antimicrobial resistance. Nevertheless, the draft genome harboured several sets of virulence genes encoding components of the bacterial flagellar system (fliG, fliN, fliM, fliS, fliW, fliE, fliP, fliQ, fliR, flhA, flhB, flgB, flgC, and flgG), flagellin A (flaA), and a secreted flagellin C (flaC). Notably, resistance via upregulation of motility and down regulation of metabolism following treatment with erythromycin has been found in C.  jejuni  [23]. Limited data exists for  C. curvus  susceptibility to erythromycin but this isolate appeared consistent to other non-jejuni\/coli species that show erythromycin resistance. This is potentially through mutations in the 23S RNA or via efflux pumps such as cmeABC [20, 24]. The gene cluster cmeABC, which confers intrinsic low level erythromycin resistance in C. coli\/jejuni, was not detected in the isolate in this study but detection may have been hampered by the genetic distance between  C. curvus  and C. jejuni\/coli or limited characterisation studies for this species of campylobacter. The patient in this case report continued antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin following broad-spectrum antibiotics. Although C. jejuni\/coli species readily acquire resistance to fluoroquinolones limiting its use, whether this applies to  C. curvus  is unclear [24]. The optimal duration of treatment following source control is uncertain, ranging between 2 days to 6 weeks. Given the propensity for  C. curvus  to form biofilms and its persistence in inhospitable environments, a prolonged treatment course may be prudent to ensure clearance of infection. The patient was treated with 3 weeks of ciprofloxacin following drainage [25]."}]},{"title":"Empyema associated with Campylobacter curvus infection","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does C. curvus normally exist?","id":"112-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"human oral cavity","answer_start":691,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Campylobacter curvus cause?","id":"112-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"thoracic empyema","answer_start":29,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about C. curvus's requirement for oxygen?","id":"112-2-1-3","answers":[{"text":"anaerobe","answer_start":671,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" We report the first case of thoracic empyema associated with Campylobacter curvus infection.

After primary infection, approximately 60% of humans remain asymptomatic, while 40% manifest clinical signs consisting of isolated fever, hepatitis, and pneumonia [3]. The principal clinical manifestation of Q fever is endocarditis with a lethal prognosis without treatment. The treatment involves a combination of doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine [1,3]. However, this long-term treatment carries the persistent risk of relapse [4]. C. burnetii is a small bacterium measuring approximately 0.2 to 0.4 \u00b5m wide and 0.4 to 1 \u00b5m long, and it has been classified in the Proteobacteria subdivision based on its 16S ribosomal RNA sequence. As C. burnetii harbours lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in its membrane, it is defined as a gram-negative bacterium. Though C. burnetii is not stained by Gram stain, it can be stained by Gimenez stain [5]. C. burnetii primarily infects domestic ruminants and pets, but arthropods have also been found to be infected. In animals, the infection is asymptomatic but induces abortions in livestock. Both abortion and parturition contribute to the bacteria spreading into the environment, since the placenta of infected animals contains large amounts of C. burnetii. Contamination via aerosols also remains the major route of infection in both animals and humans [3,6]. C. burnetii has been categorized as a biological weapon due to its high infectivity, the possibility of producing large quantities of bacteria, its environmental stability through a sporulation-like mechanism, and its dispersion via aerosolization [7,8]. C. burnetii was likely used as a bio-weapon during World War II, as a Q fever outbreak was observed during this time among army troops [9]. C. burnetii resides primarily within myeloid cells (monocytes and macrophages) [10,11] but has also been shown to infect trophoblasts [12] and adipocytes [13]. The adaptation of C. burnetii to its environment is probably critical for its survival. To survive within its host, C. burnetii interferes with the host\u2019s antimicrobial response (immunity and phagolysosome biogenesis). For this purpose, C. burnetii has an arsenal of virulence factors [14,15,16,17], including LPS [18]. The molecular variations observed in C. burnetii LPS, a major component of its outer membrane, contribute to its pathogenic properties [19,20,21]. Moreover, the intracellular fate of virulent C. burnetii in myeloid cells is also determined by its LPS composition [18]."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can C. burnetii cause?","id":"113-2-3-1","answers":[{"text":"Q fever","answer_start":184,"id":1},{"text":"Q fever","answer_start":1067,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Collectively, this evidence highlights the importance of LPS and its composition in the strategies used by C. burnetii to infect cells and develop an efficient infection that leads to Q fever. It is interesting to observe that the particular composition of C. burnetii LPS allows several axes of the immune response to be modulated, ranging from phagocytosis to vesicular trafficking. Certainly, the virulence of C. burnetii does not only depend on LPS, as other virulence factors have been identified in C. burnetii [11,14]. The recent successful culturing of C. burnetii in axenic conditions might significantly develop our understanding of C. burnetii infection by facilitating the identification of new virulence factors [62,63]. Further work is required to understand the mechanisms implied in anti-microbicidal response hijacking. It might be interesting to generate transgenic Escherichia coli expressing the LPSs from both the virulent and avirulent C. burnetii to better understand LPS action. Similarly, as several new C. burnetii strains that cause severe Q fever have been isolated [2], it will be interesting to analyse their LPS composition to determine if the virulence and clinical issues observed are linked to any particular structure or composition of LPS."}]},{"title":"From Q Fever to Coxiella burnetii Infection: a Paradigm Change","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether C. burnetii is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"113-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":354,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Coxiella burnetii cause?","id":"113-3-1-2","answers":[{"text":"Q fever","answer_start":34,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Coxiella burnetii is the agent of Q fever, or \u201cquery fever,\u201d a zoonosis first described in Australia in 1937.

C. burnetii is classically a strict intracellular, Gram-negative bacterium. However, a major step in the characterization of this pathogen was achieved by the establishment of its axenic culture. C. burnetii infects a wide range of animals, from arthropods to humans. The genetic determinants of virulence are now better known, thanks to the achievement of determining the genome sequences of several strains of this species and comparative genomic analyses. Q fever can be found worldwide, but the epidemiological features of this disease vary according to the geographic area considered, including situations where it is endemic or hyperendemic, and the occurrence of large epidemic outbreaks. In recent years, a major breakthrough in the understanding of the natural history of human infection with C. burnetii was the breaking of the old dichotomy between \u201cacute\u201d and \u201cchronic\u201d Q fever.

Moreover, the classification of C. burnetii by the CDC as a potential bioterrorism agent resulted in the disease becoming reportable in many countries, such as in the United States, which revealed that the disease is more common than previously thought. Third, the recent war in the Middle East (1) and research in the tropics (2, 3) have shown that Q fever may be a very common cause of fever in the intertropical area. Finally, a very large outbreak in the Netherlands has shown that this disease could become a major public health problem (4). Furthermore, knowledge about Coxiella burnetii has evolved, with the sequencing of multiple genomes of bacterial strains and their culture in axenic medium. This breakthrough enables genetic transformation and opens a new era. Moreover, redefining the clinical forms of Q fever is necessary, because of a lack of consensus on the distinction between acute Q fever and chronic Q fever (5).

The patient reported episodes of vomiting and diarrhea and mentioned that he had drunk water from a small river. Stool cultures performed after the beginning of antibiotic treatment did not disclose Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, Campylobacter species, or C. kerstersii. The detection of Clostridium difficile toxins A and B and glutamate dehydrogenase antigen with the commercial C. difficile detection kit from Techlab was also negative. Blood samples (two pairs of culture bottles) were drawn from a peripheral vein, and the patient was discharged under treatment with oral ciprofloxacin for gastroenteritis of unknown origin. The blood cultures were processed by a Bactec FX automated blood culture system (Becton, Dickinson, Sparks, MD). A first aerobic blood culture bottle became positive 16 h 8 min after sampling, and Gram staining revealed the presence of long, filamentous, Gram-negative bacilli (Fig. 1). Bacterial identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Leipzig, Germany) was performed on the same day by using a protocol that we recently developed on the basis of the analyses of a bacterial pellet preparation from the blood culture bottles (3,\u20135).

The anaerobic blood culture bottles from the same pair of samples became positive for Bacteroides fragilis 24 h 2 min after sample collection. We determined the following MICs (mg\/liter) for the C. kerstersii strain by the Etest method (bioM\u00e9rieux, Lyon, France): ceftazidime, 0.75; meropenem, 0.004; imipenem, 0.06; minocycline, 0.38; levofloxacin, 4; co-trimoxazole, >32; ciprofloxacin, 32.

(E) D. acidovorans identified in blood cultures from a 61-year-old man. Comamonads are Gram-negative, nonfermenting, oxidase- and catalase-positive bacteria that are motile largely because of the presence of polar flagella. The genus Comamonas originally contained Comamonas terrigena, Comamonas testosteroni (previously Pseudomonas testosteroni), and Comamonas acidovorans (previously Pseudomonas acidovorans) (6). It now contains 17 species, while C. acidovorans has been separated from the genus on the basis of its 16S rRNA gene and is now known as Delftia acidovorans (7). In 2003, Shigematsu and colleagues described a new species, Delftia tsuruhatensis, that is known to be able to cause bacteremia (8,\u201310). Biochemical analysis often misclassifies these two Delftia species. Since D. tsuruhatensis is absent from our MALDI-TOF database, we cannot exclude the possibility of misclassification. For this reason, D. acidovorans refers to D. acidovorans sensu lato, which includes D. tsuruhatensis. Although they are ubiquitously distributed in the environment (soil and water), Comamonas and Delftia species are rarely associated with infections in humans. However, several publications have incriminated C. testosteroni and D. acidovorans in particular in human diseases, including severe invasive infections such as bacteremia and meningitis (7, 11,\u201317). C. kerstersii, which was described in 2003 (1), has recently been reported as an agent of intraabdominal infection by Almuzara and colleagues (2). The present case is the first report of C. kerstersii bacteremia. We initially identified the strain at the species level directly from a positive blood culture bottle by MALDI-TOF (3,\u20135). The MALDI-TOF spectral score for C. kerstersii was 2.176 according to the manufacturer's scoring system. Since no other species reached a score above 2.0, this identification was considered valid at the species level (18). Subsequently, it was recovered both from a blood agar plate (with a spectral score of 2.26), on which its growth was maximal, and from a \u201cchocolate\u201d agar plate supplemented with NAD (factor V) and hemin (factor X). The reliability of MALDI-TOF for discrimination between Comamonas species is shown by the fact that Comamonas aquatica, the closest species also present in the MALDI-TOF database, gave a score of 1.542. The database that was used contains five Comamonas species (C. kerstersii, C. testosteroni, C. aquatica, C. terrigena, and C. nitrativorans) and five strains of D. acidovorans. The recently identified species D. tsuruhatensis is absent from this database (9), and we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the D. acidovorans bacteria identified in our laboratory by MALDI-TOF were D. tsuruhatensis. In the absence of MALDI-TOF, numerous biochemical tests (at least 11) are necessary to discriminate Comamonas species (1, 2); such identification requires isolation on an agar plate and cannot be performed on the same day of positivity directly by blood culture. Because of the excellent identification obtained with MALDI-TOF, we rather proceeded to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Using primers described in references 19 and 20, we obtained a 780-bp partial 16S rRNA gene sequence. A BLAST search for this sequence on the NCBI website revealed 99% identity (754\/755 nucleotides with no gaps) with the C. kerstersii sequence (accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AJ430348.1\",\"term_id\":\"20513177\",\"term_text\":\"AJ430348.1\"}}AJ430348.1) submitted by Wauters and colleagues (1). The divergence corresponds to a polymorphism reported by the authors at position 298 (1). This method is limited by the low number of C. kerstersii 16S rRNA sequences. Nevertheless, the first sequence identified as C. aquatica (accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"FJ493173\",\"term_id\":\"218202923\",\"term_text\":\"FJ493173\"}}FJ493173) displays 98% identity (749\/763 with two gaps). From both the blood culture bottle and the agar plate, the strain appeared as an extremely long Gram-negative filamentous bacillus, which is a very unusual phenotype for bacteria of this genus (Fig. 1). The Comamonas and Delftia strains previously isolated in our hospital are Gram-negative short bacilli or rods (Fig. 1), which is the morphology described for these organisms (1, 7). Translocation from the digestive tract seems to be a predominant cause of infections by Delftia and Comamonas species. Recently, Hagiya and colleagues reported a D. acidovorans bacteremia in a 46-year-old woman caused by translocation of the bacteria after pesticide poisoning (15). Bacteremia caused by C. testosteroni was previously reported in a 22-year-old man with a perforated appendix (21). In the four cases reported by Almuzara and colleagues, the C. kerstersii strains were isolated from intraabdominal infections (2). We previously identified another C. kerstersii strain in an intraperitoneal infection of an 11-year-old child with a perforated appendix (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Herein, the digestive origin of the C. kerstersii strain is supported by the facts that (i) the patient reported abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea; (ii) a CT scan revealed evidence of diverticulosis; and (iii) the enteric bacterium B. fragilis was isolated from a blood culture. B. fragilis is a gut commensal of humans that can cause severe diseases such as bacteremia and abscesses due to the production of several virulence factors such as capsule, endotoxins, and enterotoxins (22). C. kerstersii infection could originate from the water that the patient drank in the countryside. Comamonas sp. and D. acidovorans isolates from clinical samples in the Lausanne University Hospital from 1997 to 2013 Comamonas species have rarely been associated with infection in humans despite their ubiquitous distribution in the environment, possibly because of the difficulty in accurately distinguishing Comamonas species from Pseudomonas species in the pre-MALDI-TOF era (2). Alternatively, comamonads could have been underrecognized because of their common occurrence in a setting of a polymicrobial infection. In our 1,027-bed tertiary-care university hospital, 32 Comamonas sp. strains and 38 D. acidovorans strains where isolated from 1997 to 2013. They were isolated primarily from respiratory tract samples (33%), urogenital tract samples (23%), and digestive tract samples (21%); bacteremia represented 5% (three patients) of the cases (Table 1). The three bacteremias produced distinct clinical features but were all polymicrobial (Table 2). The first bacteremia case was due to C. testosteroni in association with Streptococcus parasanguis and Ralstonia pickettii in a 33-year-old man. A second case involved D. acidovorans in association with Streptococcus agalactiae in blood cultures from a 61-year-old man. The last case is the present C. kerstersii and B. fragilis coinfection. Summary of clinical and microbiological bacteremia due to C. testosteroni, C. kerstersii, and D. acidovorans and of a case of intraabdominal collection of C. kerstersii Like D. acidovorans, C. testosteroni is the Comamonas species associated predominantly with bacteremia (Table 1) (7, 14, 15, 17, 21). Translocation from the digestive tract and catheters is the predominant source of infection (15, 17, 21, 23). Immunocompromised children or patients with compromised immune systems such as patients with AIDS or patients with cancer or treated with aplastic chemotherapies appear to be particularly at risk of developing Comamonas sp. or D. acidovorans bacteremia (16, 23). Interestingly, Khan and colleagues reported a fatal outcome in an 4-year-old immunocompetent child with D. acidovorans bacteremia (16). The patient presented here did not display any sign of immunodeficiency, suggesting that such bacteremia may also occur in the absence of immunosuppression. The likely high inoculum concentration in the water that was drunk and the diabetic status of the patient are two significant cofactors that may explain the occurrence of bacteremia in a setting of a gastrointestinal infection. Similarly, Comamonas species bacteremia has been associated with exposure to possibly contaminated water in a fish tank (24). C. kerstersii has long been considered nonpathogenic on the basis of a lack of association with severe infections. This could be explained in part by the recent description of this species and the difficulties in accurately identifying it. This first report of polymicrobial bacteremia involving C. kerstersii reveals that this organism can be involved in severe diseases. C. kerstersii pathogenicity could be due to the versatility of this organism, which enables it to grow under various conditions. This report highlights the usefulness of MALDI-TOF for the rapid and accurate identification of nonfermenting Gram-negative bacteria that were difficult to identify in the pre-MALDI-TOF era. This could help to redefine the epidemiology and clinical syndromes due to these organisms."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can C. kerstersii cause?","id":"115-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":5015,"id":1},{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":11955,"id":2},{"text":"intraabdominal infection","answer_start":175,"id":3},{"text":"intraabdominal infection","answer_start":4904,"id":4}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Comamonas kerstersii is a nonfermenting betaproteobacterium described in 2003 that has long been considered nonpathogenic (1). This organism has recently been associated with intraabdominal infection due to perforation of the digestive tract (2). Here we describe a case of polymicrobial bacteremia due to C. kerstersii and Bacteroides fragilis in a 65-year-old diabetic man who was admitted to the emergency department of a hospital because of the sudden onset of fever and chills. The patient reported episodes of vomiting and diarrhea and mentioned that he had drunk water from a small river. Stool cultures performed after the beginning of antibiotic treatment did not disclose Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, Campylobacter species, or C. kerstersii. The detection of Clostridium difficile toxins A and B and glutamate dehydrogenase antigen with the commercial C. difficile detection kit from Techlab was also negative. Blood samples (two pairs of culture bottles) were drawn from a peripheral vein, and the patient was discharged under treatment with oral ciprofloxacin for gastroenteritis of unknown origin. The blood cultures were processed by a Bactec FX automated blood culture system (Becton, Dickinson, Sparks, MD). A first aerobic blood culture bottle became positive 16 h 8 min after sampling, and Gram staining revealed the presence of long, filamentous, Gram-negative bacilli (Fig. 1). Bacterial identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Leipzig, Germany) was performed on the same day by using a protocol that we recently developed on the basis of the analyses of a bacterial pellet preparation from the blood culture bottles (3,\u20135). The strain was identified as C. kerstersii, a Gram-negative nonfermenting bacterium, and prompted the hospitalization of the patient. The patient was afebrile at that time, but palpation of the left lower abdominal quadrant was painful. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. The anaerobic blood culture bottles from the same pair of samples became positive for Bacteroides fragilis 24 h 2 min after sample collection. We determined the following MICs (mg\/liter) for the C. kerstersii strain by the Etest method (bioM\u00e9rieux, Lyon, France): ceftazidime, 0.75; meropenem, 0.004; imipenem, 0.06; minocycline, 0.38; levofloxacin, 4; co-trimoxazole, >32; ciprofloxacin, 32. For the B. fragilis strain, the MICs were as follows: amoxicillin-clavulanate, 1.5; piperacillin-tazobactam, 6; imipenem, 0.12; meropenem, 0.025; metronidazole, 0.25; clindamycin, 16; ciprofloxacin, 32. The patient was treated with imipenem-cilastatin for 10 days and recovered. The final diagnosis was mixed bacteremia with C. kerstersii and B. fragilis in a setting of diverticulosis. Gram staining of C. kerstersii, C. testosteroni, and D. acidovorans strains isolated in clinical samples from Lausanne University Hospital. The C. kerstersii strain in the present case report was obtained directly from a blood culture bottle (A) and after culture on blood agar medium (B). The strain displays long filaments, unlike the other strains, which appear as Gram-negative short bacilli or rods. (C) A C. kerstersii strain identified in an intraperitoneal infection of an 11-year-old child with a perforated appendix. (D) C. testosteroni involved in bacteremia in a 33-year-old man. (E) D. acidovorans identified in blood cultures from a 61-year-old man. Comamonads are Gram-negative, nonfermenting, oxidase- and catalase-positive bacteria that are motile largely because of the presence of polar flagella. The genus Comamonas originally contained Comamonas terrigena, Comamonas testosteroni (previously Pseudomonas testosteroni), and Comamonas acidovorans (previously Pseudomonas acidovorans) (6). It now contains 17 species, while C. acidovorans has been separated from the genus on the basis of its 16S rRNA gene and is now known as Delftia acidovorans (7). In 2003, Shigematsu and colleagues described a new species, Delftia tsuruhatensis, that is known to be able to cause bacteremia (8,\u201310). Biochemical analysis often misclassifies these two Delftia species. Since D. tsuruhatensis is absent from our MALDI-TOF database, we cannot exclude the possibility of misclassification. For this reason, D. acidovorans refers to D. acidovorans sensu lato, which includes D. tsuruhatensis. Although they are ubiquitously distributed in the environment (soil and water), Comamonas and Delftia species are rarely associated with infections in humans.

In all of them, C. kerstersii was isolated from free fluid in the abdominal cavity. In three cases, a perforated appendix was the source of intra-abdominal infection; in the other case, it was a sigmoid colon perforation. C. kerstersii was always isolated in conjunction with other pathogens. Only one patient had an underlying disease. In all cases, the clinical evolution was favorable. The main clinical features of each case are presented in Table 1. Clinical and microbiological characteristics of patients with infections due to Comamonas kerstersii After 48 h of incubation at 35\u00b0C and in ambient air, growth of a nonfermenting Gram-negative bacillus was observed in all abdominal fluid cavity cultures. The colonies grew to a diameter of 1.5 mm on blood agar and on nutrient agar in ambient air. They were white, smooth, and nonadherent, and they had entire edges. The organisms were identified as C. kerstersii by using standard biochemical tests (1) and according to the scheme proposed by Wauters et al. (2, 3). This scheme is centered around three enzymatic activities, oxidase, trypsin (benzyl-arginine aminopeptidase), and pyrrolidonyl aminopeptidase. Additionally, biochemical tests, such as determination of acid production from glucose, colistin and desferrioxamine susceptibility, urease production, motility, nitrate reduction, growth at 42\u00b0C, and tyrosine hydrolysis, were required to make the final identification (Table 2). The isolates were also analyzed on a Vitek 2 compact system (bioM\u00e9rieux) using a GN colorimetric identification card and with API 20NE version 6.0 (numerical profiles were interpreted using the APILAB software, version 3.3.3 [bioM\u00e9rieux]). The Vitek 2 and API 20NE results are summarized in Table 3. Identification was also carried out by using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) (Bruker Daltonik), which resulted in spectral scores of 2.022, 2.066, 2.097, and 2.251 for the four C. kerstersii isolates (4). Biochemical identification of Comamonas kerstersii isolates Phenotypic identification results of the Vitek 2 and API 20NE systems The results of differential biochemical tests on our isolates, different species of Comamonas, and other nonsaccharolytic microorganisms are shown in Table 2. Because of the rarity of this pathogen, PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA was performed in order to confirm the species. PCR products of the 16S rRNA gene were obtained with the primers described by Weisburg et al. (5) and by using the Taq DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's specifications (Promega). Sequencing of the 1.4-kb PCR product was performed on both DNA strands at the Macrogen, Inc., Seoul, South Korea, sequencing facility. The obtained sequences of the 4 isolates were analyzed using the BLAST V2.0 software (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/BLAST\/). The result showed a 99% identity with the sequences corresponding to the 16S RNA ribosomal gene of Comamonas kerstersii strain LMG 5323 (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AJ430348.1\",\"term_id\":\"20513177\",\"term_text\":\"AJ430348.1\"}}AJ430348.1); there was a 2-base mismatch between the 4 isolate sequences and Comamonas kerstersii strain LMG 5323. In order to obtain a more discriminatory sequence and also confirm the obtained result, we amplified the gyrB gene (coding for subunit beta of DNA gyrase), which has been shown to resolve phylogenetic relationships in various bacterial groups (6). A PCR product of around 420 bp was obtained using the primers described by Tayeb et al. (6). In all cases, sequence analysis revealed 98% identity with the gyrB sequence of Comamonas kerstersii strain CIP 107987, which corresponds to 8 mismatches between the compared sequences (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"EU024199\",\"term_id\":\"157326804\",\"term_text\":\"EU024199\"}}EU024199), 92% identity with the gyrB sequence of Comamonas aquatica strain CIP 107986 (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"EU024201\",\"term_id\":\"157326808\",\"term_text\":\"EU024201\"}}EU024201), and 90% identity with the gyrB sequence of Comamonas testosteroni strain CNB-2 (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CP001220\",\"term_id\":\"589630713\",\"term_text\":\"CP001220\"}}CP001220). These results confirm the species identification. The antibiotic susceptibility test was performed using the Vitek 2 system employing panel AST-082 (GNS susceptibility card). The MIC results were interpreted using CLSI categories (7). MIC ranges for different antibiotics were as follows (\u03bcg\/ml): ampicillin, \u22642 to 16; ampicillin-sulbactam, \u22642; piperacillin-tazobactam, \u22644; cephalothin, \u22642; cefoxitin, \u22644 to 8; cefotaxime, \u22641; ceftazidime, \u22641 to 2; cefepime, \u22641; imipenem, \u22641; meropenem, \u22640.25; gentamicin, \u22642 to 4; amikacin, 16; ciprofloxacin, \u22640.25 to \u22654; colistin, \u22640.5 to 1; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, \u22642 to 4. C. kerstersii was highly susceptible to antibiotics, except for one of the isolates, which showed resistance to ciprofloxacin. The genus Comamonas was originally created in 1985, and it included a single species, Comamonas terrigena (8). In 1987, Pseudomonas acidovorans and Pseudomonas testosteroni were reclassified as members of the genus Comamonas. Comamonas acidovorans was subsequently reclassified as Delftia acidovorans (9). Comamonas terrigena actually comprises three genotypically separate groups: Comamonas terrigena, Comamonas aquatica, and Comamonas kerstersii (2). Barbaro et al. have reported the tendency of C. testosteroni to cause peritoneal cavity infections and perforated appendixes as specific anatomic defects resulting from the infection (10). They identified 10 cases of infections due to this microorganism in patients hospitalized at a single metropolitan hospital during a 3-year period. In 6 of them, C. testosteroni was isolated from the peritoneal cavity; in 5 cases, a perforated appendix was the source of intra-abdominal infection. In the four remaining cases, the infection corresponded to bacteremia (two cases), genitourinary tract infection, and central nervous system infection (10). However, it is possible that the isolates described by Barbaro et al. were identified as C. testosteroni because C. kerstersii is not found in the Vitek database, which is the identification source used by these authors. Gul et al. also have referred to the association of C. testosteroni with a perforated appendix. They were the first to report an acute case of bacteremia due to this organism in Turkey in a 22-year-old man with a perforated appendix (11). However, again, this microorganism might have been C. kerstersii, since it was identified only by phenotypic methods. Our work is the first to demonstrate the association of C. kerstersii with peritonitis secondary to appendix rupture. In the literature, infections due to C. kerstersii may be underestimated because in previously published cases of Comamonas infection, identification of isolates has been achieved only by phenotypic methods, which do not allow differentiation among species of the genus (10\u201316). Very few members of the Comamonadaceae family have been reported to cause infections in humans. However, most reported cases are due to Delftia acidovorans or to C. testosteroni. Both organisms are known to produce ocular infections (15, 17, 18), bacteremia, and central-line-associated bloodstream infections in patients with any underlying disease, such as malignancy, liver disease (11, 13, 14, 16, 19\u201322), and endocarditis (23, 24), among others. There is only one report of human infection due to C. terrigena in the literature. It was a case of acute bacterial endocarditis which responded appropriately to antibiotic treatment (25). C. kerstersii should be differentiated from other Comamonas species and from other related organisms that also reduce nitrates and do not assimilate or acidify sugars, such as Pseudomonas alcaligenes. Sensitivity to deferoxamine, nonuse of testosterone, a negative pyrrolidone arylamidase test, growth at 42\u00b0C, and a positive tyrosine hydrolysis test differentiate C. kerstersii from other Comamonas species, while its sensitivity to desferrioxamine and lack of trypsin activity differentiate it from P. alcaligenes (Table 2).

In all of them, C. kerstersii was isolated from free fluid in the abdominal cavity. In three cases, a perforated appendix was the source of intra-abdominal infection; in the other case, it was a sigmoid colon perforation. C. kerstersii was always isolated in conjunction with other pathogens. Only one patient had an underlying disease. In all cases, the clinical evolution was favorable. The main clinical features of each case are presented in Table 1. Clinical and microbiological characteristics of patients with infections due to Comamonas kerstersii After 48 h of incubation at 35\u00b0C and in ambient air, growth of a nonfermenting Gram-negative bacillus was observed in all abdominal fluid cavity cultures. The colonies grew to a diameter of 1.5 mm on blood agar and on nutrient agar in ambient air. They were white, smooth, and nonadherent, and they had entire edges. The organisms were identified as C. kerstersii by using standard biochemical tests (1) and according to the scheme proposed by Wauters et al. (2, 3). This scheme is centered around three enzymatic activities, oxidase, trypsin (benzyl-arginine aminopeptidase), and pyrrolidonyl aminopeptidase. Additionally, biochemical tests, such as determination of acid production from glucose, colistin and desferrioxamine susceptibility, urease production, motility, nitrate reduction, growth at 42\u00b0C, and tyrosine hydrolysis, were required to make the final identification (Table 2). The isolates were also analyzed on a Vitek 2 compact system (bioM\u00e9rieux) using a GN colorimetric identification card and with API 20NE version 6.0 (numerical profiles were interpreted using the APILAB software, version 3.3.3 [bioM\u00e9rieux]). The Vitek 2 and API 20NE results are summarized in Table 3. Identification was also carried out by using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) (Bruker Daltonik), which resulted in spectral scores of 2.022, 2.066, 2.097, and 2.251 for the four C. kerstersii isolates (4). Biochemical identification of Comamonas kerstersii isolates Phenotypic identification results of the Vitek 2 and API 20NE systems The results of differential biochemical tests on our isolates, different species of Comamonas, and other nonsaccharolytic microorganisms are shown in Table 2. Because of the rarity of this pathogen, PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA was performed in order to confirm the species. PCR products of the 16S rRNA gene were obtained with the primers described by Weisburg et al. (5) and by using the Taq DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's specifications (Promega). Sequencing of the 1.4-kb PCR product was performed on both DNA strands at the Macrogen, Inc., Seoul, South Korea, sequencing facility. The obtained sequences of the 4 isolates were analyzed using the BLAST V2.0 software (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/BLAST\/). The result showed a 99% identity with the sequences corresponding to the 16S RNA ribosomal gene of Comamonas kerstersii strain LMG 5323 (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AJ430348.1\",\"term_id\":\"20513177\",\"term_text\":\"AJ430348.1\"}}AJ430348.1); there was a 2-base mismatch between the 4 isolate sequences and Comamonas kerstersii strain LMG 5323. In order to obtain a more discriminatory sequence and also confirm the obtained result, we amplified the gyrB gene (coding for subunit beta of DNA gyrase), which has been shown to resolve phylogenetic relationships in various bacterial groups (6). A PCR product of around 420 bp was obtained using the primers described by Tayeb et al. (6). In all cases, sequence analysis revealed 98% identity with the gyrB sequence of Comamonas kerstersii strain CIP 107987, which corresponds to 8 mismatches between the compared sequences (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"EU024199\",\"term_id\":\"157326804\",\"term_text\":\"EU024199\"}}EU024199), 92% identity with the gyrB sequence of Comamonas aquatica strain CIP 107986 (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"EU024201\",\"term_id\":\"157326808\",\"term_text\":\"EU024201\"}}EU024201), and 90% identity with the gyrB sequence of Comamonas testosteroni strain CNB-2 (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CP001220\",\"term_id\":\"589630713\",\"term_text\":\"CP001220\"}}CP001220). These results confirm the species identification. The antibiotic susceptibility test was performed using the Vitek 2 system employing panel AST-082 (GNS susceptibility card). The MIC results were interpreted using CLSI categories (7). MIC ranges for different antibiotics were as follows (\u03bcg\/ml): ampicillin, \u22642 to 16; ampicillin-sulbactam, \u22642; piperacillin-tazobactam, \u22644; cephalothin, \u22642; cefoxitin, \u22644 to 8; cefotaxime, \u22641; ceftazidime, \u22641 to 2; cefepime, \u22641; imipenem, \u22641; meropenem, \u22640.25; gentamicin, \u22642 to 4; amikacin, 16; ciprofloxacin, \u22640.25 to \u22654; colistin, \u22640.5 to 1; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, \u22642 to 4. C. kerstersii was highly susceptible to antibiotics, except for one of the isolates, which showed resistance to ciprofloxacin. The genus Comamonas was originally created in 1985, and it included a single species, Comamonas terrigena (8). In 1987, Pseudomonas acidovorans and Pseudomonas testosteroni were reclassified as members of the genus Comamonas. Comamonas acidovorans was subsequently reclassified as Delftia acidovorans (9). Comamonas terrigena actually comprises three genotypically separate groups: Comamonas terrigena, Comamonas aquatica, and Comamonas kerstersii (2). Barbaro et al. have reported the tendency of C. testosteroni to cause peritoneal cavity infections and perforated appendixes as specific anatomic defects resulting from the infection (10). They identified 10 cases of infections due to this microorganism in patients hospitalized at a single metropolitan hospital during a 3-year period. In 6 of them, C. testosteroni was isolated from the peritoneal cavity; in 5 cases, a perforated appendix was the source of intra-abdominal infection. In the four remaining cases, the infection corresponded to bacteremia (two cases), genitourinary tract infection, and central nervous system infection (10). However, it is possible that the isolates described by Barbaro et al. were identified as C. testosteroni because C. kerstersii is not found in the Vitek database, which is the identification source used by these authors. Gul et al. also have referred to the association of C. testosteroni with a perforated appendix. They were the first to report an acute case of bacteremia due to this organism in Turkey in a 22-year-old man with a perforated appendix (11). However, again, this microorganism might have been C. kerstersii, since it was identified only by phenotypic methods. Our work is the first to demonstrate the association of C. kerstersii with peritonitis secondary to appendix rupture. In the literature, infections due to C. kerstersii may be underestimated because in previously published cases of Comamonas infection, identification of isolates has been achieved only by phenotypic methods, which do not allow differentiation among species of the genus (10\u201316). Very few members of the Comamonadaceae family have been reported to cause infections in humans. However, most reported cases are due to Delftia acidovorans or to C. testosteroni. Both organisms are known to produce ocular infections (15, 17, 18), bacteremia, and central-line-associated bloodstream infections in patients with any underlying disease, such as malignancy, liver disease (11, 13, 14, 16, 19\u201322), and endocarditis (23, 24), among others. There is only one report of human infection due to C. terrigena in the literature. It was a case of acute bacterial endocarditis which responded appropriately to antibiotic treatment (25). C. kerstersii should be differentiated from other Comamonas species and from other related organisms that also reduce nitrates and do not assimilate or acidify sugars, such as Pseudomonas alcaligenes. Sensitivity to deferoxamine, nonuse of testosterone, a negative pyrrolidone arylamidase test, growth at 42\u00b0C, and a positive tyrosine hydrolysis test differentiate C. kerstersii from other Comamonas species, while its sensitivity to desferrioxamine and lack of trypsin activity differentiate it from P. alcaligenes (Table 2). We emphasize that the isolation of C. kerstersii from free fluid in the abdominal cavity and a perforated appendix are indications of intra-abdominal infection. Also, we highlight the need to request polyphasic identification to obtain definitive identification.  The obtained sequences for the C. kerstersii rRNA and gyrB genes have been submitted to GenBank under accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"KC714046\",\"term_id\":\"479279025\",\"term_text\":\"KC714046\"}}KC714046 and {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"KC714047\",\"term_id\":\"479280249\",\"term_text\":\"KC714047\"}}KC714047, respectively."}]}]},{"species":"Capnocytophaga gingivalis","docs":[{"title":"Pyogenic arthritis caused by capnocytophaga gingivalis in an immunocompetent three-year-old male","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Capnocytophaga gingivalis normally exist?","id":"116-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"oral","answer_start":60,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Capnocytophaga gingivalis cause?","id":"116-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"periodontal disease","answer_start":79,"id":1},{"text":"sepsis","answer_start":138,"id":2},{"text":"pyogenic arthritis","answer_start":195,"id":3},{"text":"septic arthritis","answer_start":424,"id":4}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Capnocytophaga gingivalis is most often isolated as normal oral flora or with periodontal disease.

He was treated initially with amoxicillin-clavulanate and then meropenem in view of the limited response. A computed tomography scan of the thorax then revealed a large loculated right pleural effusion with pleural enhancement (Fig. 1). Hence, a chest drain was inserted, and the pleural fluid investigation revealed an acute neutrophilic inflammatory yield with scanty amounts of coagulase-negative staphylococci. The patient was subsequently discharged, continued on 6 weeks of cloxacillin, and appeared to respond well initially. He was also started on nasogastric tube feeding in view of his dysphagia. Loculated right pleural effusion with pleural enhancement. He was readmitted 1 month later after being noted to be hypoxic during a clinic follow-up. His chest radiograph showed worsening of the right-sided empyema (Fig. 2). He was empirically started on meropenem and vancomycin. A chest drain was inserted, and purulent, foul-smelling pleural fluid was obtained. Interval worsening of the right pleural effusion. Pleural fluid investigations revealed the pleural fluid pH to be 6.4. The pleural fluid cultures grew heavy amounts of Capnocytophaga spp. and scanty amounts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Capnocytophaga was confirmed by the heavy growth of small, slightly yellowish colonies on anaerobic plates. The organism appeared as Gram-negative fusiform rods on Gram stain and was oxidase, catalase, and indole negative but esculin and o-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) positive. The organism was subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption\u2013ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), using the Bruker Biotyper system with version 3.1 software and database, which gave a score of 1.922 for Capnocytophaga sputigena. No oropharyngeal culture was performed on the patient. A consult with the infectious disease specialist was sought, and the antibiotic regimen was adjusted to intravenous ceftazidime and oral amoxicillin. In view of the presence of Capnocytophaga sputigena, a computed tomography scan of the neck and thorax was done, which revealed no gross collections or any suggestion of esophageal perforation. The patient had been bed bound due to his recurrent strokes and had been cared for solely by his wife and maid. His wife confirmed that the patient had no history of animal contact apart from their pet hamsters. An oral swab and stool culture from the patient's hamsters did not reveal the presence of Capnocytophaga spp. The patient responded clinically and remained afebrile. Inflammatory markers were on the downward trend, and the repeated chest radiograph showed significant interval improvement of the empyema. The chest tube was subsequently removed after minimal drainage was noted. The antibiotics were de-escalated to amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin, and the patient was discharged well on day 14. He was seen in the outpatient clinic within a month and completed 6 weeks of antibiotics. Empyema is a serious complication of pneumonia with high morbidity and mortality rates (1, 2). Treatment of empyema includes appropriate antibiotic coverage based on the suspected bacteriology and the resistance patterns and drainage of the empyema. In the past, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were the traditional pathogens that were associated with empyema. However, in recent years, there has been a noted change in empyema microbiology for unclear reasons, with a shift toward the Streptococcus milleri group, a part of normal oral flora, being noted (2, 3). As far we are aware, there have been only two prior case reports of Capnocytophaga empyema reported. One was secondary to a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (4), in which the Capnocytophaga species was not described, but the patient responded well to clindamycin, penicillin G, and fosfomycin. The other was a spontaneous empyema in a patient who suffered from hepatitis C-induced liver cirrhosis (5), from which the pleural fluid grew Capnocytophaga ochracea, and the patient responded to imipenem-cilastatin. Capnocytophaga is a fastidious Gram-negative bacillus that is more commonly found in the oropharynx of dogs and cats, although it is known to have been found in the oropharyngeal flora of humans. Capnocytophaga infections usually occur following animal bites or in patients postsplenectomy. In a case series of Capnocytophaga infections from Austria (6), the patients were either immunocompromised or developed the infection as a result of iatrogenic causes. If not treated, the pathogen can result in septicemia, multiorgan failure, and death, especially in immunocompromised patients. In this case series, Capnocytophaga infections resulted in a 50% mortality rate. Our patient was eventually noted to have Capnocytophaga sputigena, which is a commensal usually found in the oropharynx. The recent introduction of MALDI-TOF MS has been able to provide rapid identification of bacteria and thus theoretically allow earlier intervention. Fedorko et al. (7) compared the use of MALDI-TOF MS with 16S rRNA sequencing for identification of 152 bacterial isolates and found it adequate in the identification of Capnocytophaga sputigena, with scores of >2.0, which was higher than the determined cutoff of 1.8 used for accurate identification of the bacterial species and genus. In our case, additional biochemical testing was performed, and these results were consistent with the final identification of Capnocytophaga sputigena given by the MALDI-TOF MS. There has been no consensus on the first-line empirical treatment of Capnocytophaga infections, given its rare incidence, although most Capnocytophaga spp. have been known to be susceptible to clindamycin, imipenem-cilastatin, and \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors, while there is variable susceptibility to penicillins and cephalosporins (8). Our patient's Capnocytophaga sputigena isolate was found to be susceptible to ampicillin and ceftriaxone, with no antibiotic resistance noted. We treated him with ceftazidime and amoxicillin for 1 week and subsequently de-escalated to ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin. Capnocytophaga spp. have been reported to produce \u03b2-lactamase (6), which may result in resistance to penicillins. Fortunately, this was not the case in our patient, and he responded well.  Capnocytophaga empyema is a rare entity that has the potential to result in high mortality rates. With an aging population, availability of better diagnostic investigations, and increasingly diverse companion animals, clinicians should be alert for unusual organisms causing empyemas.

In this study, we aimed to determine the genetic diversity, the antimicrobial resistance profiles and in vitro virulence properties of C. freundii from diarrheal patients and healthy individuals. Methods: 82 C. freundii isolates were obtained from human diarrheal outpatients and healthy individuals. Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) of seven housekeeping genes was performed. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out using the disk diffusion method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommendations. Adhesion and cytotoxicity to HEp-2 cells were assessed. PCR and sequencing were used to identify blaCTX\u2212M, blaSHV, blaTEM, qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, qnrC, qnrD, aac(6')-Ib-cr, and qepA genes. Results: The 82 C. freundii isolates were divided into 76 sequence types (STs) with 65 STs being novel, displaying high genetic diversity. Phylogenetic analysis divided the 82 isolates into 5 clusters. All 82 isolates were sensitive to imipenem (IPM), but resistant to one or more other 16 antibiotics tested. Twenty-six isolates (31.7%) were multidrug resistant to three or more antibiotic classes out of the 10 distinct antibiotic classes tested. Five MDR isolates, all of which were isolated from 2014, harbored one or more of the resistance genes, blaTEM\u22121, blaCTX\u2212M\u22129, aac(6')-Ib-cr, qnrS1, qnrB9, and qnrB13. All 11 qnrB-carrying C. freundii isolates belonged to cluster 1, and one C. freundii isolate carried a new qnrB gene (qnrB92). Six isolates showed strong cytotoxicity to HEp-2 cells, one of which was multidrug resistant. Conclusions: C. freundii isolates from human diarrheal outpatients and healthy individuals were diverse with variation in sequence types, antibiotic resistance profiles and virulence properties."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Citrobacter freundii normally exist?","id":"119-1-2-1","answers":[{"text":"intestinal tracts of both humans and animals","answer_start":136,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can C. freundii cause?","id":"119-1-2-2","answers":[{"text":"diarrhea and other infections","answer_start":237,"id":1},{"text":"food poisoning or diarrhea","answer_start":428,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are C. freundii resistant to?","id":"119-1-2-3","answers":[{"text":"extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase","answer_start":1119,"id":1},{"text":"quinolone","answer_start":1237,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Citrobacter freundii, a member of the genus Citrobacter within the family Enterobacteriaceae, is considered a commensal resident in the intestinal tracts of both humans and animals (Bai et al., 2012). However, C. freundii can also cause diarrhea and other infections in humans (Mohanty et al., 2007; Samonis et al., 2009; Bai et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2017a). Some C. freundii isolates have acquired virulence traits and caused food poisoning or diarrhea in humans (Bai et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2017a). The main virulence factors found in diarrhea-associated C. freundii are toxins, including Shiga-like toxins, heat stable toxins and a cholera toxin B subunit homolog (Bai et al., 2012). In our previous study, we identified a cytotoxic and aggregative C. freundii strain which contained a complete type VI secretion system (T6SS) located on a genomic island (GI); we also found two strongly cytotoxic C. freundii isolates, which were multidrug resistant, with resistance to \u22653 different classes antibiotics (Liu et al., 2017a). Antibiotic resistance of C. freundii has increased worldwide, and some strains harbored extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) (Park et al., 2005; Moland et al., 2006; Choi et al., 2007) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants (Shao et al., 2011). The prevalence of ESBLs were 4.9\u201320.6, 0.2\u20134.6, and 0.9% of C. freundii isolates from Korea, Japan and USA, respectively (Park et al., 2005; Moland et al., 2006; Choi et al., 2007). In our previous study, we identified two C. freundii isolates harboring a blaTEM\u22121 gene (Liu et al., 2017a). As an important PMQR determinant, qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes have been reported in C. freundii (Shao et al., 2011). In Korea, 38.4% of C. freundii isolates were found to harbor qnr genes (Park et al., 2007). In China, the qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes were present in 72.8 and 11.6% of clinical C. freundii isolates, respectively (Zhang et al., 2012). In our previous study, we found that the qnr (qnrB63 and qnrS1) and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes were present in 23.1 and 15.4% of C. freundii isolates, respectively (Liu et al., 2017a). The qnrB genes constitute the most prevalent and diverse group within the qnr family (Ribeiro et al., 2015). Bae et al. have reported that 63.1% of the qnr positive clinical C. freundii isolates carried qnrB (Bae et al., 2010). Our previous study found that two C. freundii isolates carried an variant of the qnrB77 gene (Liu et al., 2017a). In this study, we analyzed the genetic diversity and antimicrobial resistance profiles of 82 C. freundii isolates from diarrheal outpatients and healthy individuals in Maanshan, Anhui Province, China. We investigated the prevalence of blaCTX\u2212M, blaSHV, blaTEM, qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, qnrC, qnrD, aac(6')-Ib-cr, and qepA genes and determined the adhesion and cytotoxicity to HEp-2 cells of the isolates."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Citrobacter freundii cause?","id":"119-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"gastroenteritis and foodborne outbreaks","answer_start":87,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Citrobacter freundii?","id":"119-1-3-2","answers":[{"text":"emerging opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":28,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are C. freundii resistant to?","id":"119-1-3-3","answers":[{"text":"second-generation cephalosporin and cephamycin","answer_start":3404,"id":1},{"text":"ceftazidime (85%), cefotaxime (85%), piperacillin (65%), and ciprofloxacin","answer_start":3606,"id":2},{"text":"first-generation cephalosporins, such as cefazolin","answer_start":3742,"id":3},{"text":"second-generation cephalosporins, such as cefoxitin","answer_start":3813,"id":4},{"text":"third-generation cephalosporins","answer_start":3888,"id":5},{"text":"fourth-generation cephalosporins","answer_start":3943,"id":6}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"C. freundii is a recognized emerging opportunistic pathogen and has been implicated in gastroenteritis and foodborne outbreaks (Ifeadike et al., 2012; Settanni et al., 2013). A most recent foodborne outbreak reported in Germany was caused by a novel ST (Pletz et al., 2018). In this study, we examined 82 isolates of C. freundii obtained from 62 diarrheal patients from the majority of whom no other pathogens were isolated and also from 20 healthy individuals to assess the genetic diversity and antimicrobial resistance and in vitro virulence phenotypes. The 82 isolates were separated into 76 STs and 5 phylogenetic clusters. The 76 STs from this study were compared with 171 STs from the Citrobacer MLST database, We found that 11 STs in this study shared the same sequence types with isolates from the database from other countries or regions or from different sources. Among these 11 STs, ST8 contained isolates from the urine of an acute myeloid leukemia patient from Poland (Majewski et al., 2017); ST12 contained isolates from a rectal swab; ST17 contained isolates from skin necrosis, urine and rectal swabs; ST30 contained isolates from fecal samples of diarrheal patients in our previous study (Liu et al., 2017a); ST87, ST85, and ST45 each contained isolates from food in our previous study (Liu et al., 2017a; ST116 contained isolates from blood; ST161 and ST166 contained isolates from water. Therefore strains of the same STs of C. freundii may be widely present in fecal, food, and other reservoirs. In this study, we analyzed isolates from both diarrheal patients and healthy individuals in an attempt to further understand the genetic diversity of potential diarrheagenic C. fruendii. Majority of the diarrheal cases had no other pathogens isolated with C. freundii being possibly the causal organism. However, there is no separation of isolates from clinical cases and healthy individuals. Some of the diarrheal patients also had other pathogens isolated. There was no distinction of the isolates from these different sources by STs, phylogenetic clusters or adhesion\/cytotoxicity phenotypes. Among the 82 C. freundii isolates we obtained from diarrheal outpatients and healthy individuals, 25 (30.5%) of the isolates showed moderate to strong adhesion. Among these 25 adhesive isolates, 9 isolates showed moderate to strong cytotoxicity, indicating their pathogenic potential. Interestingly, adhesiveness and cytotoxicity were clustered by phylogenetic clusters. Nine (56%) and five (31%) of the 16 isolates in cluster 5 showed intermediate\/strong adhesion and intermediate\/high cytotoxicity, respectively. In comparison, only three (11%) and none (0%) of the 28 cluster 1 isolates were adhesive or cytotoxic respectively. All strongest adhesive and highly cytotoxic isolates belonged to cluster 2 or 5. Clearly there is a difference in virulence between clusters by the measures of in vitro virulence properties. However, both cluster 1 and cluster 5 are similarly likely to be isolated from healthy individuals with 8 of the 28 and 5 of the 16 isolates respectively. Further work is required to determine their difference in pathogenicity and disease. C. freundii has become increasingly resistant to a range of antibiotics (Liu et al., 2017b). Liu et al. (2017b) reported that blood isolates of C. freundii from hospital in Taiwan showed a high rate of resistance (66.7\u201397.2%) to second-generation cephalosporin and cephamycin. Mohanty et al. (2007) reported that isolates of C. freundii isolates from patients in a tertiary care hospital of India had high degrees of resistance to ceftazidime (85%), cefotaxime (85%), piperacillin (65%), and ciprofloxacin (60%). In our study, 98.8% of the isolates were resistant to first-generation cephalosporins, such as cefazolin, 74.4% resistant to second-generation cephalosporins, such as cefoxitin, 28\u201329.3% resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and 19.5% resistant to fourth-generation cephalosporins. C. freundii is often resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics, suggesting that both clinical and environmental strains may be a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance determinants (Pepperell et al., 2002; Gupta et al., 2003; Nada et al., 2004; Yim et al., 2013; Feng et al., 2015; Leski et al., 2016a; Sheppard et al., 2016). MDR C. freundii strains have been associated with a higher rate of in-hospital mortality compared to susceptible strains (Leski et al., 2016b). A survey of outpatients in Sierra Leone revealed that C. freundii isolates from UTIs were highly MDR with 22 isolates resistant to >7 antibiotics out of the 11 tested, and 81.8% of the isolates produced ESBLs (Leski et al., 2016b). In this study, we surveyed C. freundii from diarrheal outpatients, 30.6% isolates were resistant to \u22653 antibiotic classes out of the 10 distinct antibiotic classes tested. One MDR isolate was strongly cytotoxic. Such highly cytotoxic MDR strains may cause more severe disease and their MDR properties may limit clinical therapeutic options when they cause disease. ESBLs in C. freundii have been widely reported (Fernandes et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2017b). In 36 blood C. freundii isolates from a Taiwanese hospital, 16.7% of the isolates carried the blaTEM\u22121 gene and 5.6% carried blaSHV\u221212 or blaCTX\u2212M\u221215 (Liu et al., 2017b). In this study, we did not test for ESBL phenotype but screened by PCR for blaCTX\u2212M, blaTEM and blaSHV genes. We found one isolate each blaCTX\u2212M\u22129 and blaTEM positive, but none blaSHV positive (Table \u200b(Table33). The prevalence of qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes varied (Liu et al., 2017a). In China, Yang et al. (2008) had repored that the prevalence of qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes in C. freundii isolates from southern China (including Shanghai, Wuhan, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Fuzhou) and northern China (including Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Jinan) was at 63.3 and 26.7% respectively; while Zhang et al. (2012) showed the prevalence of qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr in C. freundii from southern China (Hangzhou) was at 72.8 and 68.9% respectively. In Korea, Park et al. (Park et al., 2007) showed that 38.4% of C. freundii isolates harbored qnr determinants. In our previous study (Liu et al., 2017a), we found much lower prevalence of qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes in C. freundii isolates at 23.1 and 15.4% respectively. In the present study, we also found low prevalence of qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes in C. freundii isolates at 14.6 and 2.4% respectively. Our isolates for both studies were from south central region of China (Maanshan city, Anhui Province). These findings suggest regional difference in the prevalence of resistance within a country as well as between countries. The qnrB genes constitute the most prevalent and diverse group within the qnr family, encoding proteins responsible for decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (Jacoby et al., 2011; Ribeiro et al., 2015). We found a new qnrB gene, designated as qnrB92 (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"MG744557\",\"term_id\":\"1435072027\"}}MG744557) in one C. freundii isolate. However, qnrB-carrying C. freundii isolates do not always show high level of quinolone resistance (Zhang et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2017a). Our results were consistent with this observation. The new qnrB92-carrying C. freundii isolate was susceptible to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and indeed none of the 11 qnrB isolates was resistant to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. However, two qnrB-carrying C. freundii isolates we previously reported had a high MIC for NAL (>128 \u03bcg\/mL) (Liu et al., 2017a). C. freundii isolates carrying qnrS and aac(6')-Ib-cr have been shown to have a higher MIC for quinolones (Zhang et al., 2012). In our previous study, we found that one aac(6')-Ib-cr-carrying C. freundii and one qnrS1-carrying C. freundii isolates had high MIC of three quinolones (NAL, >128 \u03bcg\/mL; CLP, >32 \u03bcg\/mL; LEV, >16 \u03bcg\/mL) (Liu et al., 2017a). However, in this study, two aac(6')-Ib-cr-carrying C. freundii (AH2014032 and AH2014015) and one qnrS1-carrying C. freundii (AH2014014) isolates were resistant or intermediary resistant to ciprofloxacin, but susceptible to levofloxacin. Isolate AH2014032 showed a QRDR region with the mutation of Thr59Ile of the gyrA gene and no mutation in the parC gene, while AH2014015 and AH2014014 did not carry any mutations in gyrA and parC genes. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was lower in both our previous study and this study at 13.0% (8\/62) and 7.3% (6\/82) respectively. This difference may be regional. There seems to be regional difference in the prevalence of qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes as discussed above. Our studies were conducted in one region of China which may differ in the prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance from other regions in China and from other countries (Park et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2012). It is also possible that the low prevalence was due to the source of the isolates. Isolates for our previous study and for this study were from food and from outpatients respectively, while the high rate reported in India was from isolates from hospitalized patients (Mohanty et al., 2007)."}]}]},{"species":"Citrobacter koseri","docs":[{"title":"Citrobacter koseri Pneumonia As Initial Presentation of Underlying Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Citrobacter koseri is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"120-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-negative","answer_start":32,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can C. koseri cause?","id":"120-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"pneumonia","answer_start":334,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Citrobacter koseri?","id":"120-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"rod","answer_start":46,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Citrobacter koseri is a motile, gram-negative rod traditionally known to cause infection in individuals with significant comorbidities and immunocompromised status.

Mohanty et al. found that 181 out of 205 Citrobacter spp. infections occurred in patients who were immunocompromised or had significant known underlying disease in a hospital in Northern India during 2004. The literature review yielded only a single case of community-acquired pneumonia in a healthy adult. To our knowledge, no cases have been reported of lung cancer presenting with coexistent C. koseri pneumonia; although, chronic lung disease, malignancy, and hypogammaglobulinemia predispose to opportunistic pulmonary infections. Moreover, the fact that the patient\u2019s fever, productive cough, and leukocytosis resolved with appropriate IV antibiotics favors a true C. koseri pneumonia rather than airway colonization. Citrobacter spp. are most commonly transmitted nosocomially via the hands of healthcare workers but are ubiquitous in the water, soil, and gastrointestinal tract of human beings. Interestingly, while our patient did not have recent nosocomial contact, he was actively working at numerous construction sites. The underlying malignancy has been correlated with severe Citrobacter infection. Patients with acute leukemia, neutropenia, and those undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy appear to be at the highest risk, but solid tumors have also been associated. Multi-drug resistance is another notable feature of Citrobacter spp. as the organism has been known to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Therefore, ensuring antimicrobial susceptibility and initial broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage is important when considering therapy. Pulmonary infection caused by C. koseri without an underlying disease process is a rare event. Diagnosing this infection should prompt further investigation for immunodeficiency and\/or intrapulmonary pathology or neoplasm. This case highlights the significance of considering an underlying disease process for previously healthy individuals presenting with opportunistic pulmonary infections.

He was admitted to the hospital due to intense diffuse myalgia, left ankle arthritis, and abdominal pain. He did not have a history of cardiac or general disease and reported no intravenous drug abuse. The clinical examination on admission showed a temperature of 39.7\u00b0C and splenomegaly combined with hepatomegaly. Cardiac auscultation found an unknown aortic regurgitation murmur. There were no signs of severe sepsis or congestive heart failure. Laboratory examinations showed a leukocyte count of 20.485 cells\/mm and a significantly elevated C-reactive protein level of 109 mg\/liter. Blood samples were inoculated in aerobic and anaerobic blood culture vials (BacT\/Alert 3D; bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Three aerobic and anaerobic vials, obtained prior to antibiotic administration, were positive and were subcultured onto nutrient agar at 37\u00b0C. The agar plates were incubated for 24 h, and colonies of gram-negative bacilli were isolated. Isolates were identified as Citrobacter koseri using API 20E strips (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), as recommended by the manufacturer. Citrobacter koseri\/Citrobacter amalonaticus (code no. 3344513; percentage of identification = 99.9%; index of typicity = 1.0) were the bacteria repeatedly identified with the API 20E strips. To confirm the identification, the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the isolate was determined as previously described (3, 4). Briefly, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR with primers Ad (5\u2032-AGAGTTTGATC[A\/C]TGGCTCAG-3\u2032) and rJ (5\u2032-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3\u2032). We determined 1,000 continuous nucleotides of the 16S rRNA gene sequence. We compared the complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of the isolate with all of the bacterial sequences available from the GenBank database using the BLAST program (National Center for Biotechnology Information): our sequence showed 99% similarity to that of the Citrobacter koseri ATCC BAA-895 type strain (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CP000822\",\"term_id\":\"157081501\"}}CP000822). The antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolate was studied by the disk diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar, according to the guidelines of the AST Committee of the French Society for Microbiology (http:\/\/www.sfm.asso.fr). Disks were purchased from Bio-Rad (Marnes-la-Coquette, France). The following 25 antimicrobial agents were tested: amoxicillin (amoxicilline), amoxicillin- clavulanate, ticarcillin, ticarcillin-clavulanate, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefalotin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin, amikacin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid, pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, rifampin (rifampicin), and fosfomycin. The isolate was resistant to amoxicillin, ticarcillin, and rifampin. The isolate had intermediate resistance to piperacillin and was susceptible to all other antibiotics tested. The MICs for four antibiotics were also determined by the agar diffusion method using the Epsilometer test (Etest; AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) on Mueller-Hinton agar, as recommended by the manufacturer. The MIC results were as follows: cefotaxime, 0.064 mg\/liter; ceftriaxone, 0.064 mg\/liter; gentamicin, 0.38 mg\/liter; and rifampin, 24 mg\/liter. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed an aortic regurgitation without evidence of mature vegetation on the aortic valve. Computed tomography of the heart did not show an aortic annulus abscess. Abdominal computed tomography identified a spleen abscess. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with aortic endocarditis due to C. koseri, according to the endocarditis diagnostic criteria of Durack et al. (2). Urine examination, stool culture, and colonoscopy were unable to determine the primary source of infection. Magnetic resonance imaging of the left ankle found no features of osteoarthritis. No immunosuppressive factors, such as diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus, lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, or hypocomplementemia, were reported. Also, the patient was not an intravenous drug user. Patient treatment included intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g twice a day) for 4 weeks combined with 5 days of amikacin. Clinical recovery (fever disappeared in 2 days, and the heart murmur disappeared within 2 weeks), negative blood cultures, and the disappearance of aortic regurgitation were reported. The patient did not have a relapse of infection or a recurrence of the regurgitation murmur during the first year of follow-up.  Members of the Citrobacter genus are motile, facultative, and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli that belong to the Enterobacteriaceae family. There are three species in the genus Citrobacter which are known to be pathogenic in humans, as follows: C. amalonaticus, C. diversus, and C. freundii. Recently, C. diversus has been renamed Citrobacter koseri. The genus is distributed in soil, water, and food, as well as in human and animal intestinal tracts. These species cause various infections in humans involving the urinary, gastrointestinal, and respiratory tracts. Infections are commonly reported in neonates, the elderly, and immunocompromised or debilitated hosts. A few cases of infective endocarditis, mostly on the right side, have previously been reported. We report a case of aortic endocarditis in an immunocompetent patient without underlying valvular disease. In humans, Citrobacter spp. are implicated mainly in urinary tract infections (46%), respiratory tract infections (16%), blood cultures (16%), and pus (12%) (7). C. koseri is also associated with retroperitoneal abscess, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, meningitis, and bacteremia in humans (1, 5, 9). In adults, infections are reported mainly in immunocompromised patients, but 11% of patients exhibit no underlying disease (7, 1). C. koseri rarely causes endocarditis. To our knowledge, there are three previous cases in the literature (6, 10, 11). The following two of the three cases presented favorable conditions: one patient had a pacemaker and the other was an intravenous drug user. Our patient did not match these conditions at admission or during the 1-year follow-up. With our patient, we did not find the germ in feces at the time of infection. C. koseri is a commensal bacterium of the digestive tract, which can be isolated from the stool, without pathological manifestations. Treatment of patients with antibiotherapy may be difficult in these types of cases, as some strains have acquired a mechanism of resistance like TEM- and SHV-type extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (8).  C. koseri endocarditis is rare in adults, particularly in nonimmunocompromised patients. This is the first report confirming infection by C. koseri using 16S rRNA gene sequencing."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whether C. koseri is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"120-2-3-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-negative","answer_start":4705,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Citrobacter koseri normally exist?","id":"120-2-3-2","answers":[{"text":"soil, water, and food, as well as in human and animal intestinal tracts","answer_start":5012,"id":1},{"text":"digestive tract","answer_start":6400,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Citrobacter koseri cause?","id":"120-2-3-3","answers":[{"text":"aortic endocarditis","answer_start":3701,"id":1},{"text":"endocarditis","answer_start":5957,"id":2},{"text":"endocarditis","answer_start":6702,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about C. koseri's requirement for oxygen?","id":"120-2-3-4","answers":[{"text":"facultative, and anaerobic","answer_start":4678,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of C. koseri?","id":"120-2-3-5","answers":[{"text":"bacilli","answer_start":4719,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"A 30-year-old man, previously healthy, was admitted to the hospital after 3 weeks of fever, night sweats, and a 2-kg weight loss. He was admitted to the hospital due to intense diffuse myalgia, left ankle arthritis, and abdominal pain. He did not have a history of cardiac or general disease and reported no intravenous drug abuse. The clinical examination on admission showed a temperature of 39.7\u00b0C and splenomegaly combined with hepatomegaly. Cardiac auscultation found an unknown aortic regurgitation murmur. There were no signs of severe sepsis or congestive heart failure. Laboratory examinations showed a leukocyte count of 20.485 cells\/mm and a significantly elevated C-reactive protein level of 109 mg\/liter. Blood samples were inoculated in aerobic and anaerobic blood culture vials (BacT\/Alert 3D; bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Three aerobic and anaerobic vials, obtained prior to antibiotic administration, were positive and were subcultured onto nutrient agar at 37\u00b0C. The agar plates were incubated for 24 h, and colonies of gram-negative bacilli were isolated. Isolates were identified as Citrobacter koseri using API 20E strips (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), as recommended by the manufacturer. Citrobacter koseri\/Citrobacter amalonaticus (code no. 3344513; percentage of identification = 99.9%; index of typicity = 1.0) were the bacteria repeatedly identified with the API 20E strips. To confirm the identification, the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the isolate was determined as previously described (3, 4). Briefly, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR with primers Ad (5\u2032-AGAGTTTGATC[A\/C]TGGCTCAG-3\u2032) and rJ (5\u2032-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3\u2032). We determined 1,000 continuous nucleotides of the 16S rRNA gene sequence. We compared the complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of the isolate with all of the bacterial sequences available from the GenBank database using the BLAST program (National Center for Biotechnology Information): our sequence showed 99% similarity to that of the Citrobacter koseri ATCC BAA-895 type strain (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CP000822\",\"term_id\":\"157081501\"}}CP000822). The antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolate was studied by the disk diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar, according to the guidelines of the AST Committee of the French Society for Microbiology (http:\/\/www.sfm.asso.fr). Disks were purchased from Bio-Rad (Marnes-la-Coquette, France). The following 25 antimicrobial agents were tested: amoxicillin (amoxicilline), amoxicillin- clavulanate, ticarcillin, ticarcillin-clavulanate, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefalotin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin, amikacin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid, pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, rifampin (rifampicin), and fosfomycin. The isolate was resistant to amoxicillin, ticarcillin, and rifampin. The isolate had intermediate resistance to piperacillin and was susceptible to all other antibiotics tested. The MICs for four antibiotics were also determined by the agar diffusion method using the Epsilometer test (Etest; AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) on Mueller-Hinton agar, as recommended by the manufacturer. The MIC results were as follows: cefotaxime, 0.064 mg\/liter; ceftriaxone, 0.064 mg\/liter; gentamicin, 0.38 mg\/liter; and rifampin, 24 mg\/liter. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed an aortic regurgitation without evidence of mature vegetation on the aortic valve. Computed tomography of the heart did not show an aortic annulus abscess. Abdominal computed tomography identified a spleen abscess. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with aortic endocarditis due to C. koseri, according to the endocarditis diagnostic criteria of Durack et al. (2). Urine examination, stool culture, and colonoscopy were unable to determine the primary source of infection. Magnetic resonance imaging of the left ankle found no features of osteoarthritis. No immunosuppressive factors, such as diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus, lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, or hypocomplementemia, were reported. Also, the patient was not an intravenous drug user. Patient treatment included intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g twice a day) for 4 weeks combined with 5 days of amikacin. Clinical recovery (fever disappeared in 2 days, and the heart murmur disappeared within 2 weeks), negative blood cultures, and the disappearance of aortic regurgitation were reported.

In 2009, a Chinese woman who had received a kidney transplant contracted peritonitis due to C. amalonaticus. In another study, a 63-year-old woman who had undergone bone marrow transplantation developed wound infection caused by C. amalonaticus. Another case concerned a 75-year-old man with pancreatic cancer who contracted a biliary tract infection and bacteraemia due to C. amalonaticus. In Italy, it was recovered from a urine sample in one patient who had received a renal graft 10 months earlier. In the United States, between 1972 and 1978, at the Seattle Veterans Administration Medical Center, C. amalonaticus was identified in urine and fluid samples from five patients. Among these patients, two had UTIs. In Thailand, a man contracted enteric fever, and C. amalonaticus was incriminated. Characteristics of patients with Citrobacter amalonaticus infections reported in our studies and elsewhere ABMT, allogenic bone marrow transplantation; AMC, amoxicillin\/clavulanate; AMT, acute myelogenous leukaemia; CAZ, ceftazidime; CIP, ciprofloxacin; CMZ, cefmetazole; CRO, ceftriaxone; Ig, immunoglobulin; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; NA data not available; SXT, cotrimoxazole; TG, tigecycline. Case = number of cases previously described in the literature; no of patient = number of patients infected in the case report. In our study, we identified four cases of C. amalonaticus infection by MALDI-TOF. The four spectra were then included in a dendrogram built with Bruker MALDI Biotyper 3.0 software (Fig. 3). Among all cases reported, including ours, we observed five patients who had undergone kidney transplantation or who had a urinary tract abnormality (case 6) [7]. Also, we observed that patients were mainly immunocompromised, including a patient with a renal graft [9], [12], a newborn patient (case 4) and patients with leukaemia and pancreatic cancer (cases 2 and 3) [4], [6]. Taken together, our observations and those in previously published reports (Table 1) lead us to think that this bacterium is an opportunistic pathogen, especially in patients with urinary tract failure. The fact that C. amalonaticus infection was rarely reported in the past may be explained by the fact that this bacterium is difficult to identify (Table 1). Thus, conventional methods such as the API system and RapID onE may underestimate their prevalence by misidentifying the strains [7], [13], [14], [15], [16]. The fact we statistically identified more C. amalonaticus infections after we instituted the routine use of the MALDI-TOF may have resulted in an improvement in the identification of this bacterial species. However, we found a statistically higher prevalence of the number of UTIs due to this bacterium even after routine use of MALDI-TOF (after 2012), suggesting that it is likely that this bacteria could be an emerging pathogen responsible for UTIs in immunocompromised patients.

A subtotal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed simultaneously for a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. The patient suffered two episodes of bacteremia with a pancreatic collection caused by Enterococcus faecalis 1 week after the operation and by an ESBL (extended-spectrum-\u03b2-lactamase)-producing Klebsiella oxytoca isolate 6 weeks later. In each instance, the patient was treated with antimicrobial agents and drainage. Ten weeks after the initial operation, the patient presented with a fever with leukocytosis. At this time, the patient had necrotic abdominal wounds and two abdominal drains. The site of the left subclavian central catheter was normal. The chest X-ray films showed stable bilateral atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusion. On the abdomino-pelvic computed tomography scan, a reduced pancreatic collection (from 5.5 by 4.1 cm to 2.6 by 1.5 cm), normal bilateral kidneys, and a new voluminous subcutaneous collection (10.4 by 6.6 cm) near the ileostomy were found. Four out of five blood culture sets (BD-Bactec, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were positive for a Gram-negative rod. Urine, pancreatic fluid, bronchial secretions, and central catheter cultures were not performed at that time. The abdominal wound culture was positive for Enterococcus faecium. The subcutaneous collection and the abdominal wounds were surgically debrided, but, unfortunately, no specimen was cultured. After 2 days of piperacillin-tazobactam, the fever resolved. One week later, two blood culture sets were negative. The patient's condition deteriorated with refractory renal insufficiency, and he died 6 weeks after the last septicemia. During a 6-day period, after 3 to 4 days, four aerobic blood culture bottles showed growth of a Gram-negative rod. The five anaerobic and one aerobic blood culture bottles remained negative after 5 days of incubation. After 48 h, the blood agar (Oxoid, Basingstoke, United Kingdom) and chocolate agar (Oxoid) plates revealed greyish small colonies with only a few lactose-negative colonies on the MacConkey plates (Oxoid). This bacterium was oxydase and catalase positive, motile, susceptible to polymyxin B, and a nonfermenter on TSI (triple sugar iron). The API 20 NE (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) gave the profile 1000477 and therefore was positive for Simmons citrate, for reduction of NO3 in NO2, and for gluconate, caprate, adipate, malate, and phenyl-acetate assimilation with 59.3% identity to Alcaligenes faecalis 2 and 30.5% identity to Achromobacter denitrificans. Two different isolates of this bacterium were identified by nearly full 16S rRNA gene sequencing (1). DNA sequences were determined with an ABI 3100 sequencer using a BigDye sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). The strains were found to be 99.1% identical to the Cupriavidus metallidurans type strain ATCC 43123 and 99.7% and 100% identical to two other strains isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis (4). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of two different isolates to eight agents was performed by the agar dilution method as standardized by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3). The MIC ranges tested included breakpoints for resistant and susceptible categories. The MICs of the two isolates were identical and are reported in Table 1. Antimicrobial susceptibility of Cupriavidus metallidurans to eight agents Cupriavidus metallidurans, once known as Ralstonia metallidurans, is able to survive to high concentrations of over 20 different heavy metals (5, 6, 9, 10).

This bacterium has not been isolated in animals (5, 6, 9, 10). Our patient suffered a significant nosocomial septicemia, since he had signs of sepsis, and C. metallidurans was recovered repeatedly from blood culture sets over a period of 6 days. The source of infection was probably the new subcutaneous collection near the ileostomy, but, unfortunately, no culture was available to confirm this. Other possible sources for this infection include the abdominal wounds, central catheter, pancreatic collection, lower respiratory tract, and urinary tract. However, the patient had not shown clinical or radiological signs to support these hypotheses and previous and subsequent cultures of these sites failed to find this bacterium.

C. gilardii has been characterized as an organism with low pathogenicity that causes opportunistic infections as three cases of infection caused by this organism were immunodeficient. One additional case caused by C. gilardii was described by Wauters et al. in 2001. The organism was the cause of catheter-related sepsis in a 7-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [15]. A bloodstream isolate from the patient was identified as Ralstonia gilardii, which was found to be susceptible to ceftazidime, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, ofloxacin, imipenem, cotrimoxazole. After combination with antimicrobials, her sepsis resolved completely [15]. A fatal case caused by C. gilardii was described by Karafin et al. in 2010 [12]. C. gilardii was recovered from the throat, stool, and blood of a 12-year old female with severe idiopathic aplastic anemia. It seems that the patient\u2019s underlying immunosuppression and the organism developed new antimicrobial resistances gave rise to fatal outcome. In addition, Tena et al. reported an infection caused by C. gilardii in 2014 [14]. The patient with a muscular abscess on the right thigh caused by C. gilardii in an immunocompromised patient, who had suffered a septic shock associated with an extensive cellulitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes.

Recently, one case of pacemaker-associated bloodstream infection caused by C. gilardii in a 90-year old woman without obvious immunodeficiency [13]. The patient was treated with different antimicrobial agents at different points in time based in part on the blood culture results and in part on the patient\u2019s response to therapy. Because of the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance during treatment, the antimicrobial agent was changed during the course of treatment. Meanwhile, the patient of our case was elderly (87 years old) that is similar to a case of pacemaker-associated bloodstream infection caused by C. gilardii in a 90-year old woman without obvious immunodeficiency [13]. The bacterial strain was verified as C. gilardii strain AU6442 according to sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene using DNA extracted from the isolates.

Cardiobacterium hominis bacteremia is accompanied by IE in 95% of cases. Wormser et al. noted that no history of dental treatment or oral infections was reported in half of cases with C. hominis bacteremia (4). Chentanez et al. reviewed 13 cases of C. hominis IE and reported that the mean time from the appearance of symptoms to the diagnosis was 108 days (5). Furthermore, the growth of C. hominis is very slow; two weeks are necessary for it to grow in a blood culture, and the culture is sometimes negative (6,7). In the present case, the patient had a history of valve replacement due to severe vulvar diseases five years ago. However, he had no recent history of dental procedures or oral infections and developed a cold without a fever only one week before the hospital admission. On arrival at the previous hospital, he met three of the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome and showed a quick sequential organ failure assessment score of 2. Therefore, the differential diagnosis included severe infection or sepsis, and the cause of the infection was considered to be IE based on the minor modified Duke criteria. Therefore, empiric broad spectrum therapy was initiated. Importantly, the blood cultures revealed Gram-negative bacilli after 6 days, and the use of meropenem could not be de-escalated until the detection of C. hominis at 20 days after the start of symptoms. We searched the literature using the ICHUSHI and the PubMed databases for original articles and case reports published in Japanese and English language, respectively, with the keywords \u201cinfectious endocarditis\u201d, \u201cHACEK\u201d, and \u201cCardiobacterium\u201d and excluded ICH cases that occurred within one week of cardiac surgery. To date, only four case reports involving four patients with ICH following unusual IE were identified among the Japanese studies (8-11), summarized in Table 1. Only one patient who suffered from ruptured mycotic aneurysm was diagnosed with HE (Aggregatibacter segnis), and the interval from the onset to the isolation of the organism was over two weeks. Another patient suffered from ICH due to non-HE by Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, whereas hemorrhagic infarction caused by Rothia spp. was reported in two patients (9,10). A search of the English literature revealed seven patients with ICH following IE with Cardiobacterium spp., including five and two cases with C. hominis and C. valvarum, respectively (Table 2) (12-18). Among these seven cases, three patients experienced subarachnoid hemorrhaging (C. hominis and C. valvarum in one and two patients, respectively), whereas four patients with C. hominis IE experienced subcortical hematoma. The duration for the detection of Cardiobacterium spp. ranged from three to four days after incubation in three cases. This review of the literature illustrates the limited number of reports on ruptured infectious or mycotic cerebral aneurysms caused by IE due to Cardiobacterium spp. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with ICH caused by C. hominis IE among the Japanese population.

Pathological findings include acute or chronic inflammation, acute suppurative inflammation, abscess formation and bacterial clumps found in the excised aneurysm. The most common causative organism is S. aureus, which is a major cause of acute IE. These aneurysms are extremely fragile and can rupture, which is often considered life-threatening and carries a high mortality rate, although the aneurysm is relatively small. Visceral infarction associated with IE is rarely detected in clinical practice because of the nonspecific clinical presentation. Although stroke occurs as a complication in a higher percentage of HE cases than in non-HE cases, hemorrhagic stroke is more frequent than embolic stroke in patients with HE. Spontaneous resolution with prolonged culture-specific antibiotic therapy, along with surveillance imaging for IE, is the most important approach (20). We recently reported that catheter-based hemostasis before surgical treatment was effective in patients with continuous hemorrhaging caused by ruptured mycotic aneurysms (21). In the current case, hemorrhaging from the aneurysm was noted to have stopped during angiography, so craniotomy was performed in the emergency room. In conclusion, prolonged culture-specific antibiotic therapy along with surveillance with extended blood cultures are critical for timely intervention in patients with ICH following C. hominis IE."}]},{"title":"[Cardiobacterium hominis pericarditis: an unusual case]","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Cardiobacterium hominis cause?","id":"125-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"isolated bacterial pericarditis","answer_start":527,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" The case of a male patient under hemodialytic therapy, who developed right heart failure is presented.

Since discovery the reporting of this bacterium has been increasing. While this increased incidence could be due to increased usage of RNA gene sequencing in clinical laboratories, it also could mark the emergence of an opportunistic infection particularly in immunocompromised patients [2]. Otherwise, it has been suggested that D. pigrum remains a commensal organism [2-5]. D. pigrum can cause eye infections, sepsis, nosocomial pneumonia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia [2,6,7]. It has been suspected in synovitis and cholecystitis and has also been isolated from gastric contents, blood and urine cultures, the nasopharyngeal regions, and even in the spinal cord [6,8,9]. D. pigrum has been reported in patients as young as two months and as old as 85 years [6]. Currently, 27 strains have been identified [10]. All strains are susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, and approximately half of the strains are known to be resistant to erythromycin [2,6]. In this report, we present a sighting of this bacterium, its antibiotic susceptibilities, and the risk factors that predict illness.

Many studies have documented asymptomatic D. pigrum residency in the upper respiratory tracts [11-13]. However, several case reports to date have documented a variety of infections. One report mentions a 64-year-old male with rheumatoid arthritis who was taking chronic prednisone and methotrexate to control synovitis. His left arm became very tender. Blood cultures were drawn, antibiotics were started, and then an arthrocentesis was performed. While the blood cultures were positive for D. pigrum, the synovial fluid was sterile but had numerous amounts of leukocytes and followed an infectious pattern [8]. Another report is of a 73-year-old male with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to heavy smoking, thrombocythemia treated with hydroxycarbamide, and childhood pulmonary tuberculosis who presented for acute respiratory insufficiency due to pulmonary embolism. Thirteen days into admission, the patient developed fever and blood cultures were drawn revealing D. pigrum. Two days later, he developed septic shock requiring emergent intubation and bronchoalveolar lavage which was positive for Staphylococcus aureus and D. pigrum [2]. In a third report, 25 patients with cystic fibrosis who were hospitalized provided sputum samples which detected D. pigrum and others [14]. Given the current knowledge that pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis are polymicrobial, such detections are significant [14-18]. In a fourth report, a 51-year-old male with no past medical history was admitted for severe aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage with respiratory distress and was subsequently intubated. On ventilator day 10, he developed signs of pneumonia and cultures of bronchial secretions ultimately revealed D. pigrum [7]. In a fifth report, D. pigrum was suspected to be the cause of an acute cholecystitis in a 76-year-old male with gallstones and no other past medical history. The blood cultures were positive for D. pigrum [9]. In a sixth report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on 27 isolates they had received. Twelve had come from blood cultures, nearly half of which had sepsis. Six were from the eye, four were from the nasopharynx, one was from the sinus, one was from sputum, and one was from the stomach suggesting an upper respiratory habitat for the bacterium [6]. Many of these patients were either less than 2 years of age or older than 65 years of age. In a seventh report, a 71-year-old female, an 85-year-old male, and a 78-year-old female all had keratitis with corneal specimens positive for D. pigrum [4]. This further suggests that D. pigrum is an emerging pathogen that particularly targets the immunocompromised and the elderly.  In comparison to prior reports, our patient followed patterns that predicted a favorable outcome [2-9,11-15]. He was a 61-year-old male with no chronic immunosuppressive conditions or medications apart from the end-stage renal disease on dialysis due to type II diabetes. He was less than 65 years of age. Therefore, he was unlikely to experience septic shock or severe respiratory distress from this organism. While he presented with shortness of breath, it was not severe as the pulse saturation was 99% on two liters of oxygen. Only one of the blood cultures initially revealed a gram-positive organism which was treated with vancomycin. A transthoracic echocardiogram was negative for endocarditis. On day 6, the initial blood culture identified the organism as D. pigrum. Two repeat peripheral cultures and a culture obtained from the dialysis ash catheter were negative. The patient was afebrile and never exhibited a leukocytosis. Given that the patient was immunocompetent and younger than 65 years, he was unlikely to experience a serious infection. Future cases would be wise to consider these criteria in D. pigrum infections. The bacterium D. pigrum is mostly pan-sensitive to conventional antibiotics. Our specimen was sensitive to beta-lactams, cephalosporin, fluoroquinolones, and vancomycin. However, it was intermediately resistant to erythromycin, which largely matched the CDC data [4,6-9]. The CDC data showed that 52% of their isolates were resistant to erythromycin, with most of those resistant samples appearing in corneal collections [6]. Despite our patient being on six weeks of cefepime and metronidazole for right foot osteomyelitis, the D. pigrum was pan-sensitive. These observations suggest that D. pigrum does not contain widespread antibiotic resistance.

The medical history of this patient, a heavy smoker, included chronic respiratory insufficiency caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and by consequences of pulmonary tuberculosis contracted during childhood and treated then. The patient also suffered from essential thrombocythemia treated with hydroxycarbamide. A bilateral pulmonary embolism was initially diagnosed (day 1) using chest computed tomography, and the patient was subsequently treated with heparin. He developed fever (day 13) and his respiratory state worsened, with the onset of septic shock (day 15). He was referred to the intensive care unit for supportive care, and endotracheal intubation became necessary. Because of suggestive clinical signs and bilateral opacities on the chest X-rays, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed (day 15). The analysis of the lavage fluid showed gram-positive cocci of two distinct morphotypes, with one round type and the other more ovoid in shape, in clusters, pairs, or tetrads. The fluid contained 250 leukocytes per mm (with 86% polymorphonucleolar neutrophils, 27% of which had intracellular cocci). Initial treatment was with vancomycin and gentamicin. At this time, a first set of cultures (using aerobic and anaerobic BacT\/Alert media; bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) from blood collected on day 13 proved to be positive. Staining of blood smears revealed the presence of morphologically homogeneous, rather ovoid, gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. Culture of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid yielded two kinds of gram-positive cocci, as follows: (i) catalase-negative cocci (7 \u00d7 10 CFU\/ml), rich were initially suspected to be an Aerococcus sp. but were called Gemella haemolysans by an API rapid ID32 STREP test strip from bioM\u00e9rieux (with a percent identity of 93.1%, a T index of 0.78, and only the pyroglutamic arylamidase reaction being positive); and (ii) Staphylococcus aureus, which was present at 2 \u00d7 10 CFU\/ml. Subculture of blood samples yielded only Gemella, as identified above. Its susceptibility was tested in vitro using disk diffusion on Mueller-Hinton agar with 5% sheep blood according to French guidelines (9; http:\/\/www.sfm.asso.fr\/). The isolate was susceptible to all beta-lactam antibiotics tested, including amoxicillin, and to macrolides, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides, and sulfonamides; it was resistant to trimethoprim. The S. aureus isolate was a methicillin- and aminoglycoside-susceptible penicillinase producer. This motivated a switch to treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (during which gentamicin was continued for 2 days). A second set of cultures from blood collected on day 15 yielded only S. aureus with the same phenotype as that described above. The state of the patient improved slowly; he extubated himself after 18 days (day 33). Unfortunately, he developed a second episode of nosocomial pneumonia 1 month later, in this case due to Klebsiella oxytoca and Serratia marcescens, which proved to be fatal (day 39). Because the biochemical techniques used were not sufficiently accurate for identification of the presumptive Gemella isolates to the species level, 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing were performed. Bacterial DNAs were extracted using IntaGene Matrix (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 475-bp segment of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using the universal primers p91E [5\u2032-GGAATTCAAA(GT)GAATTGACGGGGGC-3\u2032] and p13B (5\u2032-CGGGATCCCAGGCCCGGGAACGTATTCAC-3\u2032) (7). The nucleotide sequence was determined with a 3700 DNA analyzer following a BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction (Applied Systems). The search for similarities was carried out using NCBI BLAST and BiBi phylogenetic tools (http:\/\/pbil.univ-lyon1.fr\/). Sequence analysis of the fragment led to the identification of Dolosigranulum pigrum in both bronchoalveolar lavage and blood samples. The nucleotide homology was 100% with respect to the corresponding sequence of the reference strain of the species ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"X70907\",\"term_id\":\"437773\"}}X70907). The species Dolosigranulum pigrum was first reported in 1993 by Aguirre et al., who identified it in two specimens, a frozen spinal cord collected in 1988 and an infected eye collected in 1991, both of which yielded catalase-negative gram-positive cocci arranged in pairs, tetrads, and clusters (1). Biochemical tests using conventional commercial kits were not conclusive, but the isolates appeared to be related to Gemella species. However, the arginine dehydrogenase test was positive and there was no immunological reaction between polyclonal antisera raised against the unknown isolates and type strains of Gemella. Finally, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed no close relation to previously known bacteria, and a new genus and species were established. The most closely related species, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, are Aerococcus species, with 89% homology (1). Recently, molecular methods have led to the establishment of close to 15 genera of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci in addition to Streptococcus and Enterococcus (8). The increasing rate of isolation of these unusual bacteria is probably due to their real emergence as novel opportunistic pathogens among patients with compromised immunity, not simply a consequence of the growing use of 16S rRNA gene sequencing in clinical laboratories. The phenotypic characteristics of D. pigrum have been described (5, 8), but attempts to identify this species using commercial test strips lead to the determination of an \u201cunacceptable identification\u201d or to misidentification because the profiles generated by D. pigrum are not included in the databases provided by the manufacturers. If they were, identification with the API rapid ID32 STREP test strip system would be possible, as suggested by LaClaire and Facklam, who analyzed 27 strains (5). Using the test conventionally, before 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we were unable to identify D. pigrum. The 27 strains of D. pigrum were all susceptible to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, and 52% were resistant to erythromycin, with one strain resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (4). The strain isolated in our case was susceptible to \u03b2-lactams and erythromycin but resistant to trimethoprim. Little is known about the habitat of D. pigrum and its pathogenicity. Of the 27 isolates, 12 were from blood cultures, but bacterial sepsis was reported in only five cases. One was an isolate from a spinal cord after autopsy and one was from urine, while the remaining isolates were from the eye (n = 6), nasopharynx (n = 4), sinus (n = 1), sputum (n = 1), or stomach (n = 1), suggesting that D. pigrum may be a commensal mainly of the upper respiratory tract (4). There are only three reports of D. pigrum-related infections. One is of multiple synovitis, with two sets of D. pigrum-positive cultures from blood but not from synovial aspirates (2). In this case, the patient had received parenteral cefazolin for 24 h before aspiration of the synovial fluid, and the treatment was continued beyond blood culture and susceptibility testing. However, the high level of white blood cells in the synovial fluid (>80,000\/ml with 83% neutrophils) suggested septic arthritis. In this case, the patient was immunocompromised because he received prednisolone daily and methotrexate weekly for chronic rheumatoid arthritis, which could have facilitated the bacteremia and the secondary localization of D. pigrum in the synovial fluid. The second report is of a case of acute cholecystitis and pancreatitis potentially caused by D. pigrum (6). In this case, a set of blood cultures was positive, but a search for bacteria in the biliary tract was not carried out. The patient recovered after 2 weeks of appropriate antimicrobial therapy (empirical ampicillin-sulbactam, followed by oral cephalosporin after the blood culture results). There was no report of either chronic disease or immunodepressive treatment that could have explained infection with D. pigrum. The third report is of a case of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by D. pigrum (3). The patient was hospitalized in an intensive care unit and intubated for 10 days because of severe subarachnoid hemorrhage with respiratory failure when he developed pneumonia. He received oral decontamination with topical polymyxin E, tobramycin, and amphotericin B, which could have facilitated pneumonia due to D. pigrum. Bacteria were cultured in abundance from the bronchial aspirate but not from blood. In the three reports, D. pigrum was identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The case of nosocomial pneumonia reported here is the first in which D. pigrum was isolated from both blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Although S. aureus was also found in the latter, D. pigrum was present at a substantially higher concentration, with 7 \u00d7 10 as opposed to 2 \u00d7 10 CFU\/ml. It should be noted that D. pigrum was found in blood cultures 2 days before the onset of septic shock and acute respiratory failure. The patient received hydroxycarbamide for essential thrombocythemia, which, in itself, may have favored the supervening of an opportunistic pathogen such as D. pigrum. We excluded contamination with this bacterium for at least four reasons, including (i) its high abundance in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, (ii) the presence of D. pigrum in both the aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles, (iii) the fact that the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were collected in the pulmonary disease and intensive care units, respectively, and (iv) the fact that the two samples were handled by two technicians at two different workstations. Among the numerous catalase-negative gram-positive cocci considered to be emerging opportunistic pathogens, D. pigrum is one of the least frequently described. The use of appropriate molecular methods of identification should facilitate the determination of the true rate of its involvement in infectious diseases."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Dolosigranulum pigrum is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"128-3-3-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-positive","answer_start":1621,"id":1},{"text":"gram-positive","answer_start":9913,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"A 73-year-old man was hospitalized in December 2006 in the Pulmonary Diseases Unit of the European Hospital Georges Pompidou in Paris, France, for acute respiratory insufficiency.

He received oral decontamination with topical polymyxin E, tobramycin, and amphotericin B, which could have facilitated pneumonia due to D. pigrum. Bacteria were cultured in abundance from the bronchial aspirate but not from blood. In the three reports, D. pigrum was identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The case of nosocomial pneumonia reported here is the first in which D. pigrum was isolated from both blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Although S. aureus was also found in the latter, D. pigrum was present at a substantially higher concentration, with 7 \u00d7 10 as opposed to 2 \u00d7 10 CFU\/ml. It should be noted that D. pigrum was found in blood cultures 2 days before the onset of septic shock and acute respiratory failure. The patient received hydroxycarbamide for essential thrombocythemia, which, in itself, may have favored the supervening of an opportunistic pathogen such as D. pigrum. We excluded contamination with this bacterium for at least four reasons, including (i) its high abundance in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, (ii) the presence of D. pigrum in both the aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles, (iii) the fact that the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were collected in the pulmonary disease and intensive care units, respectively, and (iv) the fact that the two samples were handled by two technicians at two different workstations. Among the numerous catalase-negative gram-positive cocci considered to be emerging opportunistic pathogens, D. pigrum is one of the least frequently described. The use of appropriate molecular methods of identification should facilitate the determination of the true rate of its involvement in infectious diseases."}]}]},{"species":"Enterobacter cloacae","docs":[{"title":"Occurrence of virulence-associated properties in Enterobacter cloacae","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does E. cloacae normally exist?","id":"129-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"intestinal","answer_start":518,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Enterobacter cloacae is not a primary human pathogen but has been considered to be an important cause of nosocomial infections.

Most cases of urinary tract infections occur in women and are uncommon in men [5]. Prostate enlargement, also called benign prostatic hyperplasia, represents an important risk factor for UTI and bacterial prostatitis in men [5,6]. This structural abnormality is mainly associated with aging and most often affects men who are 60 years of age and older [7]. This chronic condition can prevent the bladder from emptying completely, which increases the likelihood that bacteria will grow and trigger an infection [6]. In our case, we report the occurrence of symptomatic lower UTI in a diabetic man with an enlarged prostate caused by an unusual pathogen in humans, E. hirae. Clinical diagnosis of our patient showed that the infection was limited to the lower urinary tract based on the absence of clinical signs related to upper UTI, such as flank pain, vomiting and nausea [4], and to prostatitis, such as prostate pain, fever, chills, body aches and perineal pain [5,8]. Notably, in addition to prostate enlargement, urinary tract instrumentation, infection with HIV, interventions of the male urogenital tract and underlying illnesses, such as diabetes, are the main predisposing risk factors for UTI in men [8,9]. In the current case, benign prostatic hyperplasia was the main factor for the occurrence of UTI. Nonetheless, diabetes and urinary catheter indwelling performed for this patient during the previous hospitalizations represent also two other factors that may increase the risk of UTI. The causative agent isolated in this case was identified as E. hirae. This species causes infections in animals, but reported cases in humans are rare [2]. This species was identified for the first time in young chickens [4]. The first report of a human infection caused by E. hirae was described in 1998 by Gilad et al. [10] in a case of septicemia in a 49-year-old man with renal insufficiency treated with hemodialysis. Since then, few cases have been described in humans [2,4] (Table 1). Notably, among all enterococcal infections in humans, the low incidence of E. hirae species has previously been described [1,4]. The bacterium may be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed by standard identification approaches [4]. Our case demonstrates that MALDI-TOF MS is an important tool useful for rapidly and correctly identifying the pathogen at the species level without any complementary tests. The ability of MALDI-TOF MS to identify bacterial colonies from agar was evaluated for a broad range of clinically relevant bacterial strains. The proper identification to the species level is achieved in 80\u201395% of bacterial isolates [11]. Although the strain isolated in our patient showed a sensitive profile against the majority of antibiotics tested, the study of Robredo et al. [12] showed that this species may harbour vancomycin resistance genes and may participate in their transmission to other species of enterococci. The resistance of E. hirae to ampicillin and high-level gentamicin has also been reported [13]. More importantly, enterococci long-term urinary tract colonization can worsen and can lead to subsequent invasive infections, such as bacteraemia [4,14].

In conclusion, we report the first case of symptomatic UTI involving E. hirae in a patient with benign prostatic hyperplasia from Algeria; this is the first report describing E. hirae in this country. This case emphasizes that MALDI-TOF MS is a powerful diagnostic tool for fast and accurate identification of this unusual pathogen at the species level."}]},{"title":"Enterococcus hirae bacteremia associated with acute pyelonephritis in a patient with alcoholic cirrhosis: a case report and literature review","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Enterococcus hirae cause?","id":"135-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"pyelonephritis","answer_start":247,"id":1},{"text":"urinary tract infections, biliary tract infections, and infective endocarditis","answer_start":979,"id":2},{"text":"urinary tract infections","answer_start":1434,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are E. hirae sensitive to?","id":"135-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"intravenous ampicillin followed by oral linezolid","answer_start":806,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Infections caused by Enterococcus hirae are common in animals, with instances of transmission to humans being rare.

Only 31 human cases of E. hirae have been reported (Table \u200b(Table2).2).

The mortality rate (n = 1, 3%) from E. hirae infection was similar to or lower than that of other Enterococcus spp. infections (23%) [23]. However, the accumulation of E. hirae infections warrants accurate evaluation. Three cases of E. hirae infection recurred during treatment [6, 7, 21], and two of the three recurrent cases involved infective endocarditis. In a report comparing 3308 cases of infective endocarditis caused by non-Enterococcus spp. with 516 cases of infective endocarditis caused by Enterococcus spp. collected prospectively from 35 centers in Spain, recurrence was significantly higher in cases of infective endocarditis caused by Enterococcus spp. (3.5% vs. 1.7%) [28]. There were nine reported cases of E. hirae urinary tract infections with no recurrences or deaths. The susceptibility of E. hirae to antimicrobial agents is similar to that of E. faecalis, which is susceptible to penicillin. Table \u200bTable33 shows the antimicrobial susceptibility of E. hirae infections in humans. Although some reports have reported high resistance to gentamicin [29], of the 21 antimicrobial-susceptible cases in this review, only four (19%) were gentamicin-resistant, and high-level gentamicin resistance cases were not reported. The relatively low mortality and antimicrobial resistance suggest that E. hirae is more similar to E. faecalis than E. faecium. In the present case, the patient could not tolerate ampicillin due to drug allergy and was successfully treated with linezolid after confirming susceptibility. Resistance to clindamycin and gentamicin has been reported repeatedly, and the possibility of resistance should be considered when these drugs are used. The accumulation of human clinical data is warranted to generate an accurate evaluation.

Species-level identifications have been obtained and have been widely used in recent years [13]. A study validated the accuracy of MALDI-TOF MS for the identification of Enterococcus spp. compared with the gold standard rpoA gene sequencing method for the identification of bacteria of environmental origin. The occurrence of Enterococcus spp., including E. hirae, in wild birds was correctly identified by MALDI-TOF MS [30]. Before the advent of MALDI-TOF\u2013MS, E. hirae may have been underdiagnosed because of the limitations of the diagnostic method [3]. This review found that there has been an increase in reporting of E. hirae since 2015 following the advent of MALDI-TOF MS. Enterococcus hirae is a newly recognized causative pathogen of urinary tract infections, especially in patients with underlying diseases. Clinical data such as risk factors, clinical manifestations, and antimicrobial susceptibility are lacking, and more cases should be accumulated following accurate identification. In summary, the number of E. hirae infections reported has increased following the development of MALDI-TOF MS. Although E. hirae may have a low virulence, as do other enterococci, clinicians need to consider E. hirae as a causative pathogen of urinary tract infection."}]},{"title":"Bacteremic pneumonia caused by Enterococcus hirae in a subject receiving regorafenib","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can E. hirae cause?","id":"135-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia and pneumonia","answer_start":164,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"  Introduction:  Infections due to Enterococcus hirae have rarely been reported in humans but are not uncommon in mammals and birds.

Our patient was particularly vulnerable because he was under methylprednisolone therapy and suffered from renal failure, coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He carried a permanent central venous catheter that caused thromobophlebitis at the anterior vena cava, and since the patient suffered from fever and chills after the hemodialysis sessions it is presumed that he had septic thrombophlebitis. The imaging findings in combination with the positive blood cultures suggested enterococcal thrombophlebitis and probable consequent septic pulmonary embolism. Since E. casseliflavus was not isolated from any other culture, we can only assume the primary source of infection. The three most probable sources would be the urinary tract, the central venous catheter and the gastrointestinal tract. The urine cultures where negative, thus excluding the urinary source. The culture of the catheter was negative, but this may be attributed to the antibiotic lock therapy. Another possible course of events would include, first, thrombophlebitis due to mechanical irritation by the catheter, and then colonization of the thrombus and the surrounding tissues by Enterococcus circulating in blood. Because the patient had numerous diverticula in the sigmoid, these could have served as the source of transient enterococcal bacteraemia leading to thrombus colonization.  The initial two isolates from the positive blood cultures in the suburban nephrology center, which were identified there as Enterococcus spp., had identical susceptibility profiles to the E. casseliflavus isolated in our hospital\u2019s laboratory, suggesting the same strain caused all bacteraemic episodes.  The identification as E. casseliflavus in the university hospital was based on the biochemical profile of the microorganism, the detection of the vanC gene, the positive motility and the yellow pigment. The combination of all the above traits was conclusive for E. casseliflavus [7,8]. Previous studies have proven the importance of the last two properties for correct identification at the species level since E. casseliflavus is the only motile Enterococcus producing yellow pigment [9]. The yellow pigment of the colonies was more evident after 48 h of incubation, and by inspecting the color on a white cotton swab. The antibiotic susceptibility profile of the isolate, with a relatively high MIC for vancomycin and low MICs for teicoplanin and ampicillin, is also indicative of E. casseliflavus [6]. E. casseliflavus is an unlikely pathogen but it can cause invasive infections. A review of the literature reveals numerous reports of E. casseliflavus bacteraemias mainly in patients with serious comorbidities, such as hematologic malignancy, receipt of organ transplant, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and antithrombin III deficiency [6]. Cases of vascular and iv line-related infection have also been described [10,11]. Various studies have proven that E. casseliflavus colonizes the gastrointestinal tracts of both hospitalized and non-hospitalized healthy individuals, and no definite risk factors for colonization have been identified [1,6,12]. The previous use of vancomycin is not associated with the carriage of E. casseliflavus [1]. The source of E. casseliflavus is probably the food chain since it has been isolated from farm animals and vegetables [13,14]. Vancomycin therapy for enterococcal strains with MICs of 4 \u03bcg\/mL or lower is regarded as adequate according to EUCAST. However, there have been cases in which the use of vancomycin for in vitro susceptible strains of E. casseliflavus has led to therapeutic failure or breakthrough bacteremia, therefore vancomycin is not recommended for the therapy of E. casseliflavus infection [2,6,15]. The correct species identification is crucial for the right choice of therapy. In our case, the patient was treated with a combination of daptomycin and gentamicin initially, and then ampicillin and ceftriaxone, according to the antibiotic susceptibility profile of the isolate. Furthermore, it is important to identify correctly the enterococcal species that have low level vancomycin resistance and may be misidentified as vanB, in order to prevent costly unwarranted infection control measures. E. casseliflavus has not been associated with nosocomial outbreaks, and it is not an infection control problem [6,16,17]. E. casseliflavus is a rare pathogen but it has to be considered, especially in cases of infections in immunocompromised hosts, as early accurate diagnosis increases the rates of cure and survival."}]},{"title":"Enterococcus casseliflavus septicaemia associated with hepatobiliary infection in a 75-year-old man","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Enterococcus casseliflavus cause?","id":"136-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Septicaemia","answer_start":170,"id":1},{"text":"Septicaemia","answer_start":312,"id":2},{"text":"Septicaemia","answer_start":586,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are E. casseliflavus sensitive to?","id":"136-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"beta-lactams","answer_start":682,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Enterococcus casseliflavus resistant to?","id":"136-2-1-3","answers":[{"text":"vancomycin","answer_start":65,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Enterococcus casseliflavus is a rare non-faecium, non-faecalis, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) that is responsible for up to 2% of all enterococcal infections.

Enterococcus gallinarum is normal flora in human and animal guts [1]. In recent years, with the increasing use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and invasive medical devices, infections caused by E. gallinarum have gradually increased, and multi-drug resistance has gained more and more attention. In 2010, among the isolated strains of Enterococcus in several Chinese hospitals, E. gallinarum accounted for 1.9% of isolates, and second only to E. faecalis and E. faecium [2]. As an opportunistic pathogen, E. gallinarum mainly leads to nosocomial infections, including urinary tract, abdominal, biliary tract, and a small percentage of bloodstream infections. Patients who undergo invasive operations or are immunosuppressed are susceptible [3, 4]. Central nervous system infections caused by E. gallinarum are rare, but have been reported more often in recent years. Symptoms of E. meningitis include fevers and headaches, which may be accompanied by a disturbance of consciousness or even convulsions. Some patients may have septic shock, focal neurologic deficits, petechial rashes, and meningeal irritation [4]. High value of CRP and procalcitonin can be found in patients with E. gallinarum meningitis. The diagnosis of E. gallinarum meningitis is based on clinical symptoms, cerebrospinal fluid examination, and pathogen culture. PCR is also used for diagnosis, the results of which can be obtained 48 h earlier than routine bacterial cultures [5]. The patient in this report exhibited fevers, headaches, and neck stiffness. The cerebrospinal fluid was purulent and the culture confirmed an infection with E. gallinarum. The patient had undergone a splenectomy and her immunoglobulin level was lower than the normal value, suggesting impairment of humoral immune function, which increased her risk for opportunistic infections [6]. The cerebrospinal fluid culture after the first lumbar puncture was negative, and the possibility that the pathogen was introduced by the first lumbar puncture could not be excluded. Moreover, the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics may have exacerbated the infection. There have been eight E. gallinarum meningitis cases reported worldwide (Table 3). The previous cases were generally secondary to neurosurgery, especially ventriculoperitoneal shunts. In recent years, the cases largely occurred in patients with impaired immune function. The patient in our report may have had dual risk factors (immune impairment and an invasive surgical procedure). Enterococcus gallinarum meningitis reports in the literature VP shunt ventriculoperitoneal shunt, i.v intravenous Enterococcus gallinarum carries the vanC drug-resistance gene and has a high rate of resistance for vancomycin (82.1%). The pathogen is relatively sensitive to teicoplanin and linezolid [2]. The strains carrying the vanA or vanB resistance genes have been isolated, and are resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin.[7]. Based on drug sensitivity testing, we chose linezolid at an adequate dose and time to treat the patient. The course of linezolid generally lasts 3 weeks or longer, and the prognosis is good. We recommended a 3-week course of linezolid and obtained satisfactory efficacy. The symptoms, signs, and follow-up results of the cerebrospinal fluid were all remarkably improved after treatment. The patient did not relapse after treatment was completed. Avoiding long-term invasive treatment and improving immunity are helpful to reduce the occurrence of E. gallinarum infections.

Her temperature was elevated (37.8\u00b0C). A urine sample was taken, and antibiotic treatment was started empirically with oral cefixime (400 mg every 24 h). After 24 h, Escherichia fergusonii was grown (10 CFU\/ml) as a single organism from the urine. Bacterial identification was performed using the Vitek2 ID-GN system (bioM\u00e9rieux). The identification test was repeated three times by three different operators and generated the following result: E. fergusonii, 99%, excellent identification.

The susceptibility test was repeated three times by three different operators (a summary of the MIC for each drug is shown in Table \u200bTable1).1). There are no published guidelines for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in organisms other than Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp.; therefore, the Vitek2 ESBL card failed to detect potential E. fergusonii ESBL production. Summary of MICs for drugs Notwithstanding documented cefixime in vitro activity, the patient returned 1 week later with worsening symptoms. Cefixime was discontinued, a second urine sample was taken, and cefotaxime was started (1,000 mg, every 12 h, intramuscularly). After 24 h, E. fergusonii was grown (10 CFU\/ml) as a single organism from the second urine sample, as well. We thought that the organism could be a potential ESBL producer. A modified version of the Jarlier et al. double-disk synergy method (7) for detecting clavulanic acid synergy was used. Cefotaxime (30-\u03bcg) and ceftazidime (30-\u03bcg) disks (Oxoid) were placed around an amoxicillin (20-\u03bcg)-clavulanic acid (10-\u03bcg) disk at a distance of 20 mm center to center and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight (aerobic atmosphere), but no clavulanate synergy was detected. Etest with ceftazidime plus ceftazidime\/clavulanate and cefotaxime plus cefotaxime\/clavulanate (AB Biodisk) confirmed the absence of synergy. Hence, the isolate was labeled as non-ESBL phenotype. The patient returned 7 days later with unchanged symptoms, so cefotaxime was discontinued and oral nitrofurantoin was started (50 mg every 4 h), with relief of symptoms within 36 h of starting therapy. Two urine samples were taken after 1 week and 2 weeks from the end of antibiotic therapy, respectively, but we were not able to isolate E. fergusonii again. E. fergusonii is an infrequent but emerging human pathogen whose name was coined in honor to the American microbiologist William H. Ferguson. It was formerly known as enteric group 10, and this vernacular name was used until the species could be studied further and proposed by Farmer et al. (2, 3) in 1985 as a new species in the family Enterobacteriaceae. E. fergusonii strains are gram-negative rods, oxidase negative, catalase positive, and generally motile. They are positive for indole production, lysine decarboxylase, ornithine decarboxylase, and methyl red. They ferment adonitol, l-arabinose, l-rhamnose, maltose, trehalose, cellobiose, d-xylose, and d-arabitol and ferment d-glucose with gas production. They are negative for growth in KCN, Voges-Proskauer reaction, citrate utilization (17% positive), phenylalanine deamination, urea hydrolysis, arginine dihydrolase, and fermentation of lactose, sucrose, d-sorbitol, raffinose, myo-inositol, and alpha-methyl-d-glucoside. The results of DNA hybridization experiments showed that the closest relatives to this new species were E. coli-Shigella spp., which are up to 64% related. Other genera in the family Enterobacteriaceae are more distantly related (2, 3). E. fergusonii has recently been known to be responsible for wound infections, urinary tract infections, bacteremia, diarrhea, and pleural infections. Furthermore, it has been isolated from the intestinal contents of warm-blooded animals (5, 8) and from beef during routine screening procedures (4). Funke et al. (6) isolated E. fergusonii from a stool sample taken 1 week after an episode of cholangiosepsis in a patient with pancreatic carcinoma and proposed that the intestinal flora could have been the source of a retrograde colonization of the gall bladder, resulting in cholangiosepsis. In any case, little is known about the natural habitat of the organism. To determine the mechanism of enteropathogenicity of E. fergusonii, clinical isolates from diarrheal stools have been studied and have produced significant fluid accumulation in rat ileal loops, by both live cells and their culture filtrates. Thus, it can be inferred that this species is diarrheagenic (1), but its pathogenic potential is unclear. In 1993, Funke et al. (6) described the presence of a beta-lactamase in E. fergusonii strains they studied. In 2002, Naas et al. cloned and sequenced the AmpC-type enzyme of E. fergusonii (9). In the case we reported, we first thought of potential ESBL production as a reason for cefixime and cefotaxime failure despite the in vitro activities of both. Actually, after obtaining complete disappearance of symptoms with nitrofurantoin therapy, the patient said she was not compliant with the previous beta-lactam treatment she had received; in particular, she consumed only a few cefixime doses because of an outbreak of abdominal pain and received only a few cefotaxime administrations because intramuscular treatment was too painful. This could be the reason why beta-lactam therapy failed despite in vitro activity. Beta-lactam action is time dependent, and drugs should be consumed regularly to maintain therapeutic blood levels. This case further confirms that lack of patient compliance with therapy makes it difficult to diagnose and treat infectious diseases. However, most importantly, the case report we presented provides further evidence for the pathogenic potential of E. fergusonii, although much is still unclear about its habitat, pathogenicity, and drug resistance."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whether E. fergusonii is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"140-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-negative","answer_start":3605,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can E. fergusonii cause?","id":"140-1-3-2","answers":[{"text":"wound infections, urinary tract infections, bacteremia, diarrhea, and pleural infections","answer_start":4503,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of E. fergusonii?","id":"140-1-3-3","answers":[{"text":"rods","answer_start":3619,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"A 52-year-old female presented on 16 May 2006 at our department with clinical signs of acute cystitis. Her temperature was elevated (37.8\u00b0C). A urine sample was taken, and antibiotic treatment was started empirically with oral cefixime (400 mg every 24 h). After 24 h, Escherichia fergusonii was grown (10 CFU\/ml) as a single organism from the urine. Bacterial identification was performed using the Vitek2 ID-GN system (bioM\u00e9rieux). The identification test was repeated three times by three different operators and generated the following result: E. fergusonii, 99%, excellent identification. The isolate was found to be motile at 36\u00b0C. Vitek2 AST-N021 and AST-N041 cards were used to determine susceptibilities to antibiotics. The organism was found to be susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (MIC, 4 mg\/liter), ampicillin\/sulbactam (MIC, 8 mg\/liter), piperacillin-tazobactam (MIC \u2264 4 mg\/liter), cefoxitin (MIC \u2264 4 mg\/liter), cefixime (MIC \u2264 0.25 mg\/liter), cefotaxime (MIC \u2264 1 mg\/liter), ceftazidime (MIC \u2264 1 mg\/liter), imipenem (MIC, 2 mg\/liter), meropenem (MIC \u2264 0.25 mg\/liter), nitrofurantoin (MIC \u2264 16 mg\/liter), and tetracycline (MIC, 4 mg\/liter) but resistant to ampicillin (MIC \u2265 32 mg\/liter), piperacillin (MIC \u2265 256 mg\/liter), ciprofloxacin (MIC \u2265 4 mg\/liter), levofloxacin (MIC \u2265 8 mg\/liter), gentamicin (MIC \u2265 16 mg\/liter), netilmicin (MIC \u2265 32 mg\/liter), tobramicin (MIC \u2265 16 mg\/liter), and cotrimoxazole (MIC \u2265 320 mg\/liter). The susceptibility test was repeated three times by three different operators (a summary of the MIC for each drug is shown in Table \u200bTable1).1). There are no published guidelines for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in organisms other than Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp.; therefore, the Vitek2 ESBL card failed to detect potential E. fergusonii ESBL production. Summary of MICs for drugs Notwithstanding documented cefixime in vitro activity, the patient returned 1 week later with worsening symptoms. Cefixime was discontinued, a second urine sample was taken, and cefotaxime was started (1,000 mg, every 12 h, intramuscularly). After 24 h, E. fergusonii was grown (10 CFU\/ml) as a single organism from the second urine sample, as well. We thought that the organism could be a potential ESBL producer. A modified version of the Jarlier et al. double-disk synergy method (7) for detecting clavulanic acid synergy was used. Cefotaxime (30-\u03bcg) and ceftazidime (30-\u03bcg) disks (Oxoid) were placed around an amoxicillin (20-\u03bcg)-clavulanic acid (10-\u03bcg) disk at a distance of 20 mm center to center and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight (aerobic atmosphere), but no clavulanate synergy was detected. Etest with ceftazidime plus ceftazidime\/clavulanate and cefotaxime plus cefotaxime\/clavulanate (AB Biodisk) confirmed the absence of synergy. Hence, the isolate was labeled as non-ESBL phenotype. The patient returned 7 days later with unchanged symptoms, so cefotaxime was discontinued and oral nitrofurantoin was started (50 mg every 4 h), with relief of symptoms within 36 h of starting therapy. Two urine samples were taken after 1 week and 2 weeks from the end of antibiotic therapy, respectively, but we were not able to isolate E. fergusonii again. E. fergusonii is an infrequent but emerging human pathogen whose name was coined in honor to the American microbiologist William H. Ferguson. It was formerly known as enteric group 10, and this vernacular name was used until the species could be studied further and proposed by Farmer et al. (2, 3) in 1985 as a new species in the family Enterobacteriaceae. E. fergusonii strains are gram-negative rods, oxidase negative, catalase positive, and generally motile. They are positive for indole production, lysine decarboxylase, ornithine decarboxylase, and methyl red. They ferment adonitol, l-arabinose, l-rhamnose, maltose, trehalose, cellobiose, d-xylose, and d-arabitol and ferment d-glucose with gas production. They are negative for growth in KCN, Voges-Proskauer reaction, citrate utilization (17% positive), phenylalanine deamination, urea hydrolysis, arginine dihydrolase, and fermentation of lactose, sucrose, d-sorbitol, raffinose, myo-inositol, and alpha-methyl-d-glucoside. The results of DNA hybridization experiments showed that the closest relatives to this new species were E. coli-Shigella spp., which are up to 64% related. Other genera in the family Enterobacteriaceae are more distantly related (2, 3). E. fergusonii has recently been known to be responsible for wound infections, urinary tract infections, bacteremia, diarrhea, and pleural infections. Furthermore, it has been isolated from the intestinal contents of warm-blooded animals (5, 8) and from beef during routine screening procedures (4). Funke et al. (6) isolated E. fergusonii from a stool sample taken 1 week after an episode of cholangiosepsis in a patient with pancreatic carcinoma and proposed that the intestinal flora could have been the source of a retrograde colonization of the gall bladder, resulting in cholangiosepsis. In any case, little is known about the natural habitat of the organism. To determine the mechanism of enteropathogenicity of E. fergusonii, clinical isolates from diarrheal stools have been studied and have produced significant fluid accumulation in rat ileal loops, by both live cells and their culture filtrates. Thus, it can be inferred that this species is diarrheagenic (1), but its pathogenic potential is unclear. In 1993, Funke et al.

Other Escherichia species are much less common and are possibly overlooked unless detailed identification procedures are carried out in all cases of presumptive Escherichia species bacteraemia. Escherichia albertii was first described in 2003 in association with gastrointestinal infection in Bangladeshi children [1]. The species was subsequently identified in fatal infections of wild birds in several continents [2] but has yet to be identified in a bacteraemic human infection. We describe a case of E. albertii infection in a 76-year-old woman. The patient had multiple comorbidities: a recent pelvic fracture from which she was convalescing, a dysplastic polyp of the gastric fundus with carcinoma-in-situ, hypothyroidism due to a previous thyroidectomy for papillary carcinoma, epilepsy and hypertension. She was admitted from residential care with a febrile illness of undetermined cause, an oral temperature peaking at 38.7\u00b0C, tachycardia at 139 beats per minute and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. Blood cultures collected during febrile episodes over a 24-hour period resulted in isolation of an oxidase-negative, Gram-negative bacillus from two sets of aerobic and anaerobic bottles inoculated on separate occasions. MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry) analysis with direct extraction from blood cultures resulted in presumptive identification of Escherichia coli (score > 2.0; Biotyper, Bruker Daltonik, Germany). Targeted identification of blood culture isolates identified E. coli (score > 2.0, no alternative species listed). The patient was treated initially with piperacillin\/tazobactam intravenously for 72 hours and then after defervescence with oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily. There were no clinical features of gastrointestinal infection. A midstream urine specimen contained >100 \u00d7 10 leucocytes per litre and a few bacteria on centrifuged deposit, but no significant bacterial growth. She defervesced rapidly and made an uneventful clinical recovery. The possibility of an alternative aetiology was only considered when a molecular method of identifying common causes of bacteraemia (film array; BioFire, bioM\u00e9rieux, France) produced a discrepant result: positive for Enterobacteriaceae but negative for E. coli. All isolates were oxidase-negative, Gram-negative bacilli on 5% horse blood agar and initially non-lactose-fermenting colonies on MacConkey agar. We identified them by substrate utilization (API 20E, bioM\u00e9rieux), resulting in a low discrimination E. coli identification (results of tests against were urease positive, rhamnose and melibiose negative). Glucose, lactose and ONPG (O-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside) tests in the panels were consistently positive. An isolate extract was prepared for 16S-based identification, which was consistent with E. albertii (Fig. 1). Though the patient had no history of gastrointestinal infection symptoms such as diarrhoea, we sought evidence of Shiga toxin [3] by PCR assay and tissue culture cytotoxin assay. Both were negative. The patient had no recent contact with birds, caged or otherwise, young children or other family members with active diarrhoea; no recent history of travel outside the Perth metropolitan area; and no investigations in the preceding months for diarrhoea or other clinical features of gastrointestinal infection. No bird die-off had been reported in the state during the previous 6 months. Neighbour-joining tree depicting 16S rRNA gene sequence of STRAIN PERTH and related taxa. GenBank accession numbers are shown in brackets. The aetiology of this infection would have been missed had it not been for the discrepancy we recorded between the MALDI-TOF results and the film array identification of the blood culture isolates because the urinary leucocytosis was interpreted as presumptive evidence of urosepsis, and the initial identification of E. coli isolated from repeated blood cultures was taken as further evidence of urosepsis. The phenotypic features of E. albertii are sufficiently variable to render classic phenotypic identification methods unreliable [4], and even the use of substrate utilization leant towards a low-discrimination E. coli result for all blood culture isolates. Although the erroneous identification of E. coli did not result in inappropriate clinical management, the opportunity for early public health intervention against a cluster of gastrointestinal infection cases might have been missed if the strain had been Shiga toxin positive [5], [6]. It is of particular note the woman had no epidemiologic connection with sick birds or children, as documented in early reports of E. albertii infection [1], [2]. E. albertii has recently been recognized as an early speciation event close to the separation of E. coli and Shigella species and has complex genomic diversity [7]. The addition of clinically significant E. albertii strains to culture collections used for identification databases will assist in timely recognition of this emerging pathogen and will help clarify whether this species is responsible for a wider spectrum of human disease than originally thought."}]}]},{"species":"Elizabethkingia meningoseptica","docs":[{"title":"Elizabethkingia meningoseptica: Emerging nosocomial pathogen in bedside hemodialysis patients","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"142-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-negative","answer_start":45,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Elizabethkingia meningoseptica normally exist?","id":"142-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"hospital environment in water supplies, disinfectants, and medical devices","answer_start":172,"id":1},{"text":"water and sink of the ICU","answer_start":962,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can E. meningoseptica cause?","id":"142-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia and lower respiratory tract infection","answer_start":578,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are E. meningoseptica resistant to?","id":"142-1-1-4","answers":[{"text":"colistin","answer_start":1143,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Elizabethkingia meningoseptica's requirement for oxygen?","id":"142-1-1-5","answers":[{"text":"aerobic","answer_start":59,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Elizabethkingia meningoseptica?","id":"142-1-1-6","answers":[{"text":"bacillus","answer_start":67,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, a ubiquitous gram-negative aerobic bacillus, is an emerging hospital acquired pathogen in patients on dialysis.

It is a gram-negative, nonfermenting, nonmotile, oxidase positive bacilli growing on enriched media only. It has been isolated from hospital water supplies, sinks, taps, saline solution used for flushing procedures, disinfectants, and medical devices, including feeding tubes, arterial catheters, and respirators. Environmental studies have revealed that the organism can survive in chlorine-treated municipal water supplies, often colonizing sink basins and taps, intubation tubes, humidifiers, incubators for newborns, ice chests and syringes, and has become a potential reservoir for infections in the hospital environment.[1,2,4] In newborns, meningitis is the most common disease caused by this organism. Bacteremia and pneumonia are the other common manifestations in neonates. Infections usually affect premature infants and often occur as outbreaks.[5,6] Prematurity is a primary risk factor for E. meningosepticum infection. It has been implicated in meningitis, endocarditis, cellulitis, abdominal infection, wound infection, sinusitis, epididymitis, dialysis associated peritonitis, septic arthritis, and eye infections in severely immunocompromised patients such as end-stage hepatic and renal disease, extensive burns, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome, as well as community-acquired necrotizing fasciitis, pneumonia, and bacteremia.[7,8,9,10] Treatment for E. meningosepticum infections should be based on the mininimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results from susceptibility tests.[11] Elizabethkingia spp. are resistant to multiple antibiotics, especially to \u03b2-lactams. Many possess two different types of \u03b2-lactamases, namely class A extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases and class B metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (MBLs); the latter confer resistance to carbapenems, which are widely used to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria. Two types of MBL, BlaB and GOB, have been identified in isolates of E. meningosepticum. They are constitutively resistant to multiple antibiotic classes and has unusual resistance patterns and mechanisms.[12,13,14]"},{"qas":[{"question":"Where does E. meningoseptica normally exist?","id":"142-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"sink basins and taps","answer_start":5187,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can E. meningoseptica cause?","id":"142-1-3-2","answers":[{"text":"meningitis","answer_start":4066,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are E. meningoseptica sensitive to?","id":"142-1-3-3","answers":[{"text":"Piperacillin","answer_start":3199,"id":1},{"text":"agents generally used to treat infections caused by gram-positive bacteria (rifampicin, quinolones, vancomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole","answer_start":3398,"id":2},{"text":"vancomycin","answer_start":3573,"id":3},{"text":"vancomycin","answer_start":3971,"id":4}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are E. meningoseptica resistant to?","id":"142-1-3-4","answers":[{"text":"colistin","answer_start":3598,"id":1},{"text":"multiple antibiotics, especially to \u03b2-lactams","answer_start":3104,"id":2},{"text":"many antimicrobial classes commonly used to treat infections caused by gram-negative bacteria (aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol","answer_start":3240,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"E. meningoseptica has been documented as a pathogen among immunocompetent neonates, but our study suggests that adult patients on mechanical ventilation and bedside hemodialysis may be more prone to this infection. There are very few reports of E. meningoseptica infection in dialysis patients, few published from Asian countries. There are no reports of E. meningoseptica infection among patients on dialysis from India. As per our knowledge, this is the first such study on E. meningoseptica. Eight patients over a period of 6 months acquired E. meningoseptica infection in the hospital. As compared to other studies where E. meningoseptica was a late infection, approximately after 50-70 days after admission to hospital,[16] in our study, the time interval between the admission of a patient to hospital and infection with E. meningoseptica was an average of 5 days (3-7 days). The possible explanation for this early bacteraemia could be the presence of the organism in the tap water used for hand washing. One possible explanation for early bacteremia in the study population is the use of contaminated water for hand washing by healthcare workers. Other possibilty could be the early use of broad spectrum anitibiotics including Colistin. E. meningoseptica has a strong predilection for extremes of age. Our patients were aged between 50 and 60 years. In patients with bacteremia, check blood cultures performed to exclude contamination or colonization were found positive again for the organism. In patients who had pneumonia E. meningoseptica was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Infections with E. meningoseptica were generally associated with a poor outcome, with a cumulative mortality of 33% among postneonates.[17] In our study, patients had relatively lower mortality (25%) and the reason may be early detection and effective antibiotic therapy. Patients with E. meningoseptica bacteremia have poor prognosis and use of inappropriate antibiotics further complicate the situation. All these patients had infection with multidrug resistant organisms for which colistin was being used prior to acquiring E. meningoseptica infection. The organism was resistant to most antimicrobial agents tested and developed resistance to others during treatment. Clinical and Laboratory standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints for this organism are still not established, making the choice of antibiotic very difficult for the microbiologists as well as the clinicians. The mortality in the above-mentioned patients could also be attributed to comorbid conditions and underlying disease. Most frequently isolated pathogen in these patients was Multi drug resistant (MDR) pseudomonas and MDR klebsiella. Pseudomonas was only sensitive to colistin and klebsiella sensitive to only colistin and tigecycline. Colistin had the strongest association with E. meningoseptica in these patients. Colistin seems to have acted as a selective factor that allowed E. meningoseptica to emerge in the hospital. E. meningoseptica has unusual resistance patterns and mechanisms. E. meningoseptica are resistant to multiple antibiotics, especially to \u03b2-lactams. However, they show a moderate susceptibility to Piperacillin. They are also resistant to many antimicrobial classes commonly used to treat infections caused by gram-negative bacteria (aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol) but are often susceptible to agents generally used to treat infections caused by gram-positive bacteria (rifampicin, quinolones, vancomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). This gram-negative bacillus is vancomycin sensitive and colistin-resistant. In our study, sensitivity rates of E. meningoseptica isolates to the antibiotics were found to be (100%) to vancomycin, (100%) to rifampicin, (87.5%) to ciprofloxacin, (75%) to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, (75%) to piperacillin\/tazobactam, (62.5%) to tigecycline, (37.5%) to piperacillin, (25%) to tetracycline, and (12.5%) to cefoperazone\/sulbactam. Vancomycin has been previously recommended as the drug of choice for the treatment of neonatal meningitis due to E. meningoseptica.[16] However, the high MICs (16 \u03bcg\/mL) of vancomycin for the organisms as demonstrated in our study as well as those of others[18] first indicate that vancomycin should not be considered the drug of choice. On the contrary, this study confirms the better activity of ciprofloxacin against E. meningoseptica infection, as has been seen in other studies.[3,19] In this study, patients were treated with a combination of ciprofloxacin with either piperacillin\/tazobactam or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Two of our eight cases died despite treatment. Tigecycline, tetracycline, and rifampicin may be good alternatives as found in the susceptibility patterns in our study. As the organism is resistant to chlorination, water from hand wash sink of the ICU was one of the environmental source in our hospital. E. meningoseptica infection was seen only in patients who were undergoing bedside hemodialysis. In addition, general infection control practices among the dialysis technicians were inconsistent, particularly hand washing and following aseptic. E. meningosepticum often colonizes sink basins and taps, and has become a potential reservoir for infections in the hospital environment. This population of patients may become colonized after acquiring the organism from the healthcare worker and infection may occur subsequently.[20] Once microbiologist suspects this infection, clinician should immediately be informed so that appropriate antibiotic changes may be instituted early.

It is resistant to a broad range of regularly used antimicrobials including polymixins. However, it is susceptible to antibiotics used to treat gram-positive bacteria i.e. rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole . Vancomycin alone or in combination with rifampicin, has in the past been successful in treating E. meningoseptica, but its efficacy has been questioned by recent studies . In our case, a post cardiotomy infant on prolonged mechanical ventilation developed sepsis. The time from hospital admission to isolation of organism was 16 days. Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from respiratory secretions initially and was treated with colistin and imipenem. While the treatment for klebsiella was being followed up with cultures of tracheal secretions, the second sample from respiratory secretions grew E. meningoseptica which was resistant to almost all routine antibiotics including colistin. Sepsis with klebsiella and treatment with colistin both might have acted as selective factors along with the other risk factors like younger age, delayed sternal closure, ECMO, PD catheter, urinary catheter, prolonged mechanical ventilation, invasive lines and chest drains. All these allowed E. meningoseptica to emerge in the environmental vicinity of the patient and cause nosocomial pneumonia in this already immuncompromised infant. A recent case series by Govindaswamy et al. reported 12 days (10-25 days) of median time from admission to isolation of E. meningoseptica. All their patients had a history of recent hospitalization, at the time of sepsis, they were on mechanical ventilation in ICU. All cases received 2 or more antibiotics which included colistin and carbapenems. All isolates were resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Mortality rate was high (75%) in their study. Our patient had findings similar to the above study. E. meningoseptica has unusual resistance patterns and mechanisms. The reappearance of septic shock was probably attributed to this organism. The child was already infected with Klebsiella, probably it increased the susceptibility of this child to E. meningoseptica sepsis and unusually the child never responded to the treatment and succumbed to septic shock. In view of its multidrug-resistant nature, its propensity to infect infants, as in our case, and to spread in the hospital environment, its prompt diagnosis in clinical samples and sensitivity testing along with reinforcement of standard infection control measures are essential to reduce outbreaks."}]}]},{"species":"Elizabethkingia anophelis","docs":[{"title":"Elizabethkingia anophelis sp. nov., isolated from the midgut of the mosquito Anopheles gambiae","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Elizabethkingia anophelis is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"143-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":280,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Elizabethkingia anophelis resistant to?","id":"143-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin and tetracycline","answer_start":414,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Elizabethkingia anophelis?","id":"143-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"rod-shaped","answer_start":248,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" The taxonomic position, growth characteristics and antibiotic resistance properties of a slightly yellow-pigmented bacterial strain, designated R26(T), isolated from the midgut of the mosquito Anopheles gambiae, were studied.

Elizabethkingia miricola was detected by culture and Metagenomic next generation sequencing in CSF. Early identification of this strain and treatment with sensitive antibiotics is necessary to reduce morbidity and mortality. Case Report: A 24-year-old male was admitted to a West China Hospital because of headache and vomiting for 2 months. Symptom features included acute onset and long duration of illness. Notably, headache and vomiting were the primary neurological symptoms. Routine cerebrospinal fluid culture failed to identify the bacterium; however, Elizabethkingia miricola bacterium was detected via second-generation sequencing techniques. Elizabethkingia miricola was found to be a multi-drug resistant organism, hence, treatment with ceftriaxone, a commonly used drug for intracranial infections was ineffective.

Typical culturing methods often misidentify Elizabethkingia spp. as Flavobacterium or Chryseobacterium. Although diagnosis is based on culturing samples taken from sterile sites, such as blood, a proper identification of this bacterium requires an expertise that goes beyond the capabilities of a typical clinical laboratory. A 35-year-old woman diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency was admitted to our center. Previous treatment with antibiotics (amoxicillin plus clavulanate, first and third generation of cephalosporins, macrolides) and systemic corticosteroids (up to 120 mg\/day of prednisolone) failed to arrest the spread of inflammation. Gingival recession was observed in her oral cavity, resulting in an apparent lengthening of her teeth. In addition to typical commensal bacteria, including streptococci and neisseriae, strains of Rothia mucilaginosa and Elizabethkingia miricola were identified upon a detailed microbiological examination using a MALDI-TOF MS Biotyper system. The presence of the latter strain correlated with severe periodontitis, lack of IgA in her saliva and serum, a very low IgG concentration (< 50 mg\/dl), IgM-paraproteinemia, decreases in C3a and C5a and microvascular abnormality. High-dose immunoglobulin (to maintain IgG > 500 mg\/dl) and targeted levofloxacin treatment resulted in immune system reconstitution, oral healing, and eradication of the Elizabethkingia infection.  E. miricola rarely causes disease in healthy individuals. However, the overgrowth of commensal bacteria, lack of IgG\/IgA, microvasculopathy and complement cascade activation in patients with humoral immunodeficiency may facilitate Elizabethkingia invasion. Overuse of antibiotics, particularly beta-lactams, may cause mucosal colonization by E. miricola, followed by its multiplication combined with periodontitis that prompts bacterial translocation. MALDI-TOF Biotyper analysis may become a method of choice for identification of Elizabethkingia infections.

Despite the clinical importance of E. miricola infections, this bacterium has not been characterized epidemiologically, as its route of transmission and portal of entry remain poorly understood. This bacterium usually induces pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infections, with the latter consisting of the formation of pulmonary nodules followed by sepsis [1], lung abscess and pleural effusion [2], or severe nosocomial pneumonia [3]. However, the pathogenesis of established infections has not been clarified. Most clinical isolates of the genus Elizabethkingia come from patients infected by E. meningoseptica and having severe forms of infection, such as meningitis, sepsis, and pneumonia [4]. Moreover, most clinical isolates have been obtained from patients in Asia and Africa [5], areas in which E. anophelis and E. meningoseptica are highly prevalent in the gut of Anopheles mosquitoes [6, 7], with horizontal transfer having been observed within a colony of Anopheles gambiae [8, 9]. However, vector-borne transmission has not been reported for E. miricola and, although cases of E. miricola infections have been reported, the epidemiology of this species remains unclear [1]. E. miricola has also been isolated from synovial fluid [10] and urine samples [11] of European patients; these sites are normally sterile sites, with the mode of entering a susceptible host remaining unclear. The presence of E. miricola in urine suggests septicemia, which can be fatal if not treated early with appropriate antibiotics. In addition, E. miricola has been isolated from the blood of a patient with acute alcoholic pancreatitis [12]. Most clinical laboratories are unable to identify Elizabethkingia at the species level. New techniques, such as matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, have been utilized recently for microbiological typing [10]. In the near future and following the construction of appropriate reference spectrum databases, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry may become a method of choice for identifying pathogens [5, 13]. Little is known about the predisposing factors, preclinical phase, web of causation, pathologic evidence and period of communicability of E. miricola infection. Host-pathogen interactions in the colonization phase may be crucial for subsequent invasion at the portal of entry. Understanding these steps can help in developing preemptive therapies and assessing risk factors in patients with primary immunodeficiency. This case report describes a patient who experienced a primary E. miricola infection and the complex diagnostic process and successful preemptive therapy in this patient.

Previously, it was classified into genus Chryseobacterium but later in 2005, the genus was changed to Elizabethkingia on the basis of the comparative analytical studies involving DNA hybridization and sequencing of the 16S rRNA region[8]. E. miricola is a gram-negative (0.5 \u03bcm \u00d7 1-2.5 \u03bcm), non-motile, non-spore-forming bacterium. It grows well on blood and MacConkey agar producing non-fermenting sticky colonies.

It can be differentiated from Chryseobacterium because of the absence of yellow pigment in culture. Urease production is the test used to differentiate E. miricola from E. meningoseptica[8]. Till date, E. miricola has been isolated from blood and sputum and has been found to be responsible for sepsis. The first case of E. miricola was reported in 2008 in an adult with mantle cell carcinoma, who underwent stem cell transplant[5]. In this case, E. miricola was isolated from sputum and blood and the identification was confirmed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Later on, E. miricola was isolated from the blood sample of a young female with alcoholic pancreatitis[6]. More recently, E. miricola has been isolated from a patient with severe sepsis and pulmonary abscess[9]. In both the above cases, the isolate was identified by MALDI-TOF. In the present case, E. miricola was isolated from the urine sample of a young female with clinical features of UTI and bilateral hydroureteronephrosis. The clinical presentation pointed towards differential diagnosis like pyelonephritis, renal abscess, renal infarction, venous obstruction or ATN. However, the USG findings of bilateral hydroureteronephrosis and sterile blood culture pointed towards localised urinary tract infection. E. miricola has been found to be multidrug resistant similar to E. meningoseptica which is known to harbor \u03b2-lactamases showing resistant to \u03b2-lactams and carbapenems[10]. The E. miricola isolates have been found to be resistant to many antibiotics. Previous studies have shown resistance to ampicillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, gentamicin, cotrimoxazole, colistin and with variable susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, vancomycin and rifampicin[5,6,11]. It is interesting to note that, E. miricola isolates in previous studies were sensitive to levofloxacin, but in our case, the isolate was resistant to both ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. Limited clinical reports, varied susceptibility profiles, lack of antimicrobial susceptibility breakpoint and no defined consensus for the empiric treatment regimen makes it difficult to treat such rare organisms. We present the first case report of human UTI caused by rare multidrug resistant E. miricola. The present case emphasizes the clinical importance of rare non-fermenters like E. miricola in human infections especially in case of UTI.

Here we analyzed the effect of F. magna on human primary neutrophils. F. magna strains ALB8 (expressing protein FAF), 312 (expressing protein L) and 505 (naturally lacking both protein FAF and L) as well as their associated proteins activate neutrophils to release reactive oxygen species, an indication for neutrophil oxidative burst. Co-incubation of neutrophils with the bacteria leads to a strong increase of CD66b surface expression, another indicator for neutrophil activation. Furthermore, all tested stimuli triggered the release of NETs from the activated neutrophils, pointing to a host defense mechanism in response to the tested stimuli. This phenotype is dependent on actin rearrangement, NADPH oxidases and the ERK1\/2 pathway. Proteins FAF and L also induced the secretion of several pro-inflammatory neutrophil proteins; HBP, IL-8 and INF\u03b3.

Only two patients recovered completely, one patient died due to complications of the infection, one patient retained a slight hemiparesis and one patient had permanent hearing loss. The first description of human systemic infection with F. necrophorum was made by Veillon and Zuber in 1898 of a young child with chronic purulent otitis media with septic arthritis of the knee, cerebral abscess and signs of overwhelming systemic infection. Courmont and Cade made the first description in 1900 of human postanginal septicaemic infection with F. necrophorum. The disease was more clearly characterized by Lemi\u00e8rre in 1936, but it was not until 1983 that, for the first time, the term Lemi\u00e8rre's syndrome was used 1. The most common presentation of Lemi\u00e8rre's syndrome is postanginal septicaemia with septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and distant septic metastases secondary to an acute oropharyngeal infection. Fusobacterium necrophorum is an unusual cause of mastoiditis, sinusitis and meningitis with a limited number of published reports 2\u201310. Fusobacterium necrophorum can cause invasive disease with severe complications in previously healthy children and adults. Binding and activation of plasminogen, platelet aggregation, and production of haemagglutinin by F. necrophorum are all likely to be important in the pathogenesis of abnormal coagulation and inflammation seen in patients with Lemi\u00e8rre's syndrome 1,11. This corresponds with the high rate of thrombotic complications observed in four of five patients in our analysis. In addition, some strains appear to be more virulent due to binding of factor H, a complement controlling glycoprotein 12. Its uncommon presentation and the difficulties encountered in isolating F. necrophorum, with the delay of adequate treatment, contributes to the high morbidity and mortality. In Case 1 appropriate antibiotics for F. necrophorum were delayed for 12 h due to the initial suspicion of infection with encapsulated H. influenzae. In cases of a severe course of an acute otitis media or sinusitis, especially with thromboembolic complications, abscess formation and pleomorphic Gram-negative rods in the Gram stain, the empiric antibiotic treatment must include agents to treat F. necrophorum. Various antibiotics are currently being used, as illustrated in our case series. No uniform guidelines exist, though most authors recommend the combination of penicillin and metronidazole or carbapenems 1. There are conflicting reports in the literature on the susceptibility of Fusobacterium isolates to penicillin. Some older studies report on beta-lactamase-producing strains of Fusobacterium isolates 13,14. In a recent study, all F. necrophorum isolates were susceptible to penicillin (MIC <0.5 mg\/L) 15. In the Netherlands, resistance of Fusobacterium isolates to penicillin is very rare and was not found in two previously published cases of F. necrophorum infections in the Netherlands 3,10, nor in our case series. Although F. necrophorum is considered to be a commensal of the human upper respiratory tract, its role as a pathogen of throat infection is also considered. Using real-time PCR, Jensen 16 detected F. necrophorum in 48% of 61 throat swabs from patients with non-streptococcal tonsillitis and in 21% of 92 throat swabs from healthy controls. Ludlam et al. 17 analysed throat swabs from 411 university students and 103 patients with a sore throat. A swab copy count of 50 000 or more was significantly more frequent in the group of patients with a sore throat (35%) compared with the asymptomatic subjects (4.6%). Using conventional anaerobic culture techniques, two studies in patients with sore throat report the presence of F. necrophorum in 4.9% and 9.7%, respectively 18,19. Within a short time period (9 months), we encountered five patients with a complicated infection with F. necrophorum originating from otitis or sinusitis. Interestingly, two recent studies from Israel also report on the emergence of F. necrophorum infections associated with complicated mastoiditis. Yarden-Bilavsky et al. 20 describe seven children with acute F. necrophorum mastoiditis diagnosed during a 3.5 year period of whom five presented in the last 6 months of the study. In a second study, 17 of 27 F. necrophorum infections in children were diagnosed during the last 4 years of a 10 year study period. The most common source of infection was otogenic (70%) 21. Three older surveys from Denmark (1990\u20131995), Wisconsin (1995\u20132001) and France (1995\u20132006) demonstrated a temporary increase in Lemi\u00e8rre's syndrome 22\u201324. Most authors speculate that the more restricted use of antibiotics and the shift in prescribed antibiotics from traditional antibiotics such as penicillin to macrolides and cephalosporines, which lack activity against F. necrophorum, as well as improved identification methods by the use of broad-spectrum 16S rRNA PCR have contributed to this increase in incidence. However, the Netherlands is known for having a restricted antibiotic prescription policy for upper respiratory tract infections well before the apparent increase of F. necrophorum infections, which has not changed during the last few years. Although microbiological laboratories in the Netherlands introduced MALDI-TOF MS in 2009, resulting in a significant improvement in the identification of anaerobes 25, it is unlikely that this pathogen has been unrecognized in severe syndromes as occurred in the patients we described when using conventional identification techniques. Another possible explanation could be the pneumococcal vaccination, which was incorporated in the national immunization programme in the Netherlands in 2006. The nasopharynx of children is colonized by multiple microorganisms. Numerous associations between these viral and bacterial pathogens have been found during nasopharyngeal carriage 26. It is increasingly recognized that disruption of this microbiota with its synergistic and interfering interactions facilitates respiratory tract infections such as otitis media 27,28. Replacement of vaccine serotype pneumococci by non-vaccine serotypes after pneumococcal vaccination and its effects on carriage of and infection with other common pathogens such as H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus has been described in several studies 28,29. However, meta-genomic analyses have shown a high variability of the nasopharyngeal microbiota, including the presence of F. necrophorum and other less prevalent commensals 30. We hypothesize that an increase in F. necrophorum infections may be explained by a similar disrupting impact of pneumococcal vaccination. In conclusion, we report five patients diagnosed recently with complicated infection with F. necrophorum originating from an otitis or sinusitis. Imaging should be considered in all infections with Fusobacterium arising from the upper respiratory tract or head region due to the high incidence of thrombotic complications and abscess formation. Appropriate antibiotics should not be delayed. The reason for the recent emergence of F. necrophorum infections is not clearly established."}]},{"title":"Meningitis due to Fusobacterium necrophorum in an adult","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Fusobacterium necrophorum cause?","id":"148-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"necrobacillosis","answer_start":90,"id":1},{"text":"meningitis","answer_start":222,"id":2},{"text":"meningitis","answer_start":737,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Fusobacterium necrophorum resistant to?","id":"148-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"metronidazole and penicillin","answer_start":496,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Fusobacterium necrophorum may cause a number of clinical syndromes, collectively known as necrobacillosis.

Other central nervous system complications caused by Fusobacterium include cranial nerve palsy, sinus venous thrombosis, and brain abscess [1,2]. In one recent series of brain abscesses, F. necrophorum was the most common anaerobe isolated, found in 33% of patients [2]. The term \"necrobacillosis\" or \"Lemierre syndrome\" is used for the severe bacteremic illness caused by F. necrophorum. Lemierre syndrome has been described to progress through three stages [3]. The primary infection is pharyngitis in the majority of patients. The second stage is invasion into the pharyngeal space with the development of internal jugular septic thrombophlebitis. The third stage is metastatic spread of the infection. In one series of F. necrophorum meningitis, middle ear infection was the source for 75% of the cases [4]. Other predisposing infections include sinusitis, pharyngitis and lung infections [5]. Diagnosis is often delayed by the difficulties in isolating and identifying the organism. A high index of suspicion is necessary in the diagnosis of this infection. There have been over 20 reported cases of meningitis due to Fusobacterium [1,4,6-19], only one of which was in an adult [6]. Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, the outcome is poor with the mortality rate from meningitis due to Fusobacterium as high as 33% with residual sequelae common among survivors (60%) [7,8]. Although the antibiotic regimen of choice has not been established metronidazole seems to be a useful agent. Some authors have suggested the addition of penicillin G to treat this infection [8].

Review of the English literature shows that bacteremia is usually related to device\/graft infection or endocarditis (Table 1). Cargill et al. described 17 cases of Granulicatella spp. endocarditis between 1997 and 2012 including infections of prosthetic valves and a pacemaker lead [2]. It is suspected that cases of Granulicatella spp. infective endocarditis are underreported and that some cases may be a cause of reported culture-negative endocarditis. Bacteremia with Granulicatella spp.without endocarditis has been reported, including a single case of infection of aortic atheroma with associated dissection [2]. Other infections have included seeding by prosthetic material or surgery with isolates from brain abscess, CSF, joint space, vertebrae, and breast implant [2]. Clinical characteristics of other cases of Granulicatella adiacens reported in the English literature in PubMed.  Neonate; NS: not specified; with permanent neurological sequelae. To our knowledge, we are the first to report a case of G. adiacens as a cause of monomicrobial nonneutrocytic bacterascites. Bacterascites is thought to represent colonization of ascites fluid and may progress to the life threatening complication of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The pathogens related to bacterascites are similar to SBP; however the diagnosis of SBP requires the presence of >\/= 250 PMN cells\/mm in addition to a positive Gram stain and\/or culture of the ascitic fluid [24, 25]. The pathogenesis of SBP is thought to be directly related to hepatic dysfunction, with portal hypertension and local intestinal immunodeficiency leading to intestinal bacterial overgrowth and intestinal mucosal edema leading to breakdown of the epithelial barrier and increased permeability, which can allow for bacterial translocation to other tissues. In patients with ascites fluid that contains protein levels <1 g\/dL and\/or C3 levels < 13 mg\/dL, there is a predisposition for infection [24]. Notably, Altay et al. described a case of G. adiacens bacterial peritonitis in a 55-year-old woman, but this was thought to be a peritoneal dialysis-related infection [13]. In that case, the patient was being treated empirically with intraperitoneal cefazolin and gentamicin when repeat cultures of the dialysate grew a single colony of G. adiacens susceptible to the empiric regimen. The patient completed 14 days of antibiotic therapy and showed clinical improvement after 2 days with concomitant decrease in ascites leukocytosis [13]. The origin of G. adiacens in our patient remains unclear. The possibility of an occult colon cancer leading to bacterial translocation, akin to Streptococcus bovis, was considered, but as colonoscopy was unrevealing for malignancy, this is unlikely. As discussed above, CT and MRCP of the abdomen demonstrated a fluid collection near the tail of the pancreas that may have communicated with the wall of the descending colon. Although subsequent colonoscopy did not show evidence of a direct communication, such an area of weakness in the gut wall may have been susceptible to earlier bacterial translocation.  Granulicatella spp., when not seen as a causative agent in infective endocarditis or other endovascular infections or bacteremia, have been associated with surgical intervention or seeding from a prosthesis [2]. As this patient had prior extensive abdominal surgery, it is possible that the original introduction of G. adiacens occurred during surgery and simply went undetected due to his lack of symptoms. This possibility seems less likely given that the patient had undergone one previous paracentesis several months earlier that grew no organism; however G. adiacens is not easily detected and has been found in peritoneal fluid previously documented as culture-negative [13]. It remains questionable whether the presence of Granulicatella spp. bacterascites was clinically significant, given the patient's failure to develop peritonitis. The question of asymptomatic bacterascites is controversial as to whether it may be an incidental finding in patients without laboratory diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The tendency is to err on the side of treatment in these cases. Older data show that, in patients with nonneutrocytic monomicrobial bacterascites, 62% (65\/105) became sterile without antimicrobial intervention. The remaining 38% progressed to SBP [24]. The current recommendations for antibiotic treatment of and prophylaxis against SBP are targeted toward patients with cirrhosis and low ascites protein levels, neither of which describes this patient [25]. With respect to Granulicatella spp. as a causative agent, more data would be necessary to draw conclusions regarding the pathogenicity of this particular organism in ascites fluid. Limitations of earlier data are subject to the nutritionally variable nature of this organism, as its prior eponym suggests. Fortunately, 16s rRNA sequencing and mass spectrometry are becoming increasingly more common diagnostic tools, in some cases replacing traditional culture, which often confused this organism with poorly growing Streptococcus. Our patient was treated with a 5-day course of intravenous vancomycin although Granulicatella adiacens infections have most commonly been treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic (Table 1). Intravenous vancomycin was chosen in this case because the patient had a penicillin allergy. Additionally, antibiotic susceptibility testing could not be performed for this isolate so beta-lactam antibiotic susceptibility or resistance could not be assessed. A limitation of our report is that successful eradication was not definitively demonstrated, as repeat paracentesis was not performed because the patient was doing well clinically, and our patient was asymptomatic prior to initiation of microbial therapy. Contamination is not suspected, as the organism grew from two separate cultures, obtained two days apart. If our patient manifests symptoms or if future blood or ascites fluid cultures grow Granulicatella spp., further evaluation is warranted with blood cultures and a repeat echocardiogram as well as additional abdominal\/pelvis imaging. Repeat paracentesis with positive culture could indicate a complication such as an abscess formation or continued reinfection via translocation. At the current time, the patient has been out of the hospital for more than six months, and he has experienced no apparent complications. This case presents an interesting finding of Granulicatella spp. as an infectious agent involved in bacterascites with potential to progress to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis that has not been previously described in the literature. Clinical suspicion and testing for Granulicatella spp. in peritoneal fluid may help us to learn more about this commensal organism of the GI tract and its pathogenicity and response to therapy. We would recommend serial paracenteses with monitoring for clearance of the organism from the fluid and\/or development of laboratory confirmed neutrocytic SBP for future cases prior to initiation of therapy."}]},{"title":"Granulicatella adiacens bacteremia in an elderly trauma patient","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Granulicatella adiacens is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"149-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-positive","answer_start":197,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Granulicatella adiacens normally exist?","id":"149-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"human mucosal surfaces, inhabiting the oral cavity and urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts","answer_start":64,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Granulicatella adiacens cause?","id":"149-2-1-3","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":290,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Granulicatella adiacens?","id":"149-2-1-4","answers":[{"text":"cocci","answer_start":211,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"  Background:  Granulicatella adiacens is a normal commensal of human mucosal surfaces, inhabiting the oral cavity and urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts and only rarely causing disease.

In most of the cases we reviewed, NVS were isolated from automated culture bottles.[5,6,7,8,9] However, on subculture from these positive bottles growth is generally either delayed or\/and very faint. Colonies can be identified by satellitism around colonies of Staphylococcus aureus, typical Gram stain picture of pleomorphism and increased growth on thiol containing media. Phenotypic ID is technically demanding and unreliable but automated ID systems like Vitek or API Strep panels have been successfully used as an easy alternative with good sensitivity and specificity. 16S rRNA gene sequencing is confirmatory but is feasible only in reference labs. Clinically, Nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS) has been associated with up to 2.3% of cases of streptococcal bacteremia and up to 5% cases of streptococcal endocarditis.[10] Localized pyogenic infections are rare. There are a few isolated reports of septic arthritis, vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis. Out of 101 NVS isolates studied by Christensen and Facklam, the clinical diagnosis was endocarditis in 58% of patients, septicemia or bacteremia in 26% of patients and only single patient had scrotal abscess.[1] In 2007, CLSI published guidelines (M45) for AST testing for NVS along with other fastidious microorganisms.[4] It recommended broth microdilution method (BMD) using cation-adjusted Mueller\u2013Hinton broth supplemented with 2.5%\u20135% lysed horse blood and 0.001% pyridoxal HCl. The lack of disc diffusion breakpoints, FDA approved automated susceptibility systems, and limited availability of BMD in clinical laboratories makes it difficult to accurately report susceptibility pattern of these bacteria. E test on different media has been compared with BMD and has shown variable results in different studies.[11,12] There are only a few studies on AST pattern of NVS and most of these have used breakpoints for Streptococcus viridans to interpret their data.[10] In the largest study on susceptibility pattern of NVS, Alberti et al. tested 132 isolates (37 A. defectiva, 90 G. Adiacens, and 5 G. elegans) by BMD using CLSI M45 guidelines.[13] Only 38.9% of G. adiacens isolates were found susceptible to Penicillin, however, a large number (47.8%) of isolates were intermediate susceptible. Susceptibility to other antibiotics was cefotaxime (18.9%), ceftriaxone (43.3%), erythromycin (52.2%), clindamycin (84.5%), and levofloxacin (91.9%) but all G. adiacens isolates were 100% susceptible to meropenem and vancomycin. Both of our isolates were also susceptible to penicillin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, levofloxacin, and vancomycin except erythromycin resistance shown by one. We could not find any well documented Indian research study on AST pattern of NVS except for a few case reports and a case series comprising of seven cases. In most of these reports, NVS was grown in BacT alert\u00ae bottle, identified by Vitek\u00ae and AST was performed either by disc diffusion method or Vitek\u00ae and interpreted using CLSI breakpoints for viridans streptococci [Table 1]. We also could not perform BMD due to nonavailability of required media supplements. Erythromycin resistance was reported in 7 out of 12 isolates reviewed by us, but penicillin resistance was less with only 2 isolates being resistant. Both of our isolates were also penicillin susceptible, but one was erythromycin resistant.[14] Granulicatella adiacens-case reports from India On the basis of susceptibility data and clinical outcome of various cases, it is recommended to treat NVS related endocarditis like enterococci with penicillin and aminoglycoside.[6] However, pyogenic infections have been treated successfully with various antibiotics such as penicillin, cefotaxime, and erythromycin.

Gemella are facultative anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, which are commensal organisms of the human oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, upper respiratory tract, and genitourinary tract [8]. To date, the members of this genus include G. haemolysans, G. morbillorum, G. bergeri, G. sanguinis, G. palaticanis, and G. cuniculi. DNA hybridization and comparative 16 s rRNA gene sequencing is used to classify the different members of this genus [2]. Moreover, G. parahaemolysans and G. taiwanensis have been identified recently using phylogenetic analysis of groEL, rpoB, and recA sequences [7]. It is not easy to differentiate G. haemolysans from viridans streptococci and from Gemella strains not of the species G. haemolysans by the standard identification procedures. First, G. haemolysans is easily decolorized in the Gram stain and may therefore appear as either Gram-variable or even Gram-negative. It can be misidentified as a viridians streptococcus or remain unidentified. Second, identification of Gemella in the laboratory has also some limitation because of the characteristics of these bacteria. When slow growing, catalase negative, gram-positive cocci are observed in samples, Gemella should be considered. Although infections caused by Gemella are rare, G. haemolysans has been reported in cases of infectious endocarditis [[10], [11], [12]], meningitis [[13], [14], [15]], spondylodiscitis [16], bone infection [17], infected aneurysm [18], liver abscess [19], and eye infections [[20], [21], [22]]. Although three cases of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis due to Gemella spp. have been reported [[1], [2], [3]], no cases of secondary bacterial peritonitis in patients with a duodenal perforation associated with G. haemolysans have yet been reported. Our patient was in septic shock. In general, Gemella infections have a good prognosis, but fatal cases due to Gemella spp. have been reported, such as septic shock syndrome and Ludwig\u2019s angina [[23], [24], [25]]. In our case, the results differed between the commercial biochemical tests using phenotypic identification systems and MALDI-TOS MS. Although commercial phenotypic identification systems are readily available, precise identification requires additional testing, especially in cases of uncommon strains. To date, a few studies have evaluated the accuracy and sensitivity of the test to detect Gemella spp. strains and even less studies have focused on differentiating the species of the genus [9]. Our identified G. haemolysans score was higher than that described by Chiristensen et al (median of 1.870 for six strains studied) [17]. Thus, MALDI-TOF MS seems promising for the identification of strains belonging to the genus Gemella. Similarity, precise identification of rare species is usually performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. However, MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA sequencing are not perfect in cases of rare species. For example, Hikone at al. reported a case of infective endocarditis caused by G. taiwanensis, but they initially showed that G. haemolysans was identified by MALDI-TOS MS because G. taiwanensis was not included in the database at that time. They found that the biochemical profile was atypical. Based on the findings with the 16S rRNA sequencing, distinguishing G. haemolysans from G. taiwanensis was difficult because the sequence homology was more than 99%. Finally, G. taiwanensis was identified by whole groEL sequence analysis [25]. Actually, Hung at al. reported that distinguishing G. haemolysans, G. parahaemolysans, and G. taiwanensis is not possible using 16S rRNA gene sequencing because these strains have a sequence homology of more than 99.6% [7]. Although MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA sequencing are useful for identification of the species, the basic biochemical profile is also important to identify a rare species."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Gemella haemolysans cause?","id":"151-2-4-1","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":60,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"In conclusion, we report here a case of Gemella haemolysans bacteremia in a patient with a duodenal perforation and secondary peritonitis.

The most commonly reported cases are of endocarditis. Other reports include cases of pericarditis, arthritis, pleural empyema, liver abscess, peritonitis, pneumonia, soft tissue infection, and septic shock, including one fatal case. Poor dental health, dental manipulation or surgery, colorectal disease or procedures, steroid therapy, diabetes mellitus, and hepatorenal dysfunction have all been recognized as predisposing factors for infections with G. morbillorum. The most common cause of G. morbillorum-associated endocarditis is poor dental health or dental procedures. Vasishtha et al suggested that infections due to G. morbillorum may occur in immunocompromised patients. In the case we present, the patient was not in a condition of congenital immunodeficiency, malnutrition, human immunodeficiency virus infection, trauma, hematological malignancy, diabetes, organ transplant, or therapeutic immunosuppression. We recognized the patient as being immunocompetent and she had not undergone any recent dental procedures. We administered cefazolin (1 g) as a prophylactic antibiotic immediately before the laparoscopic hysterectomy, following the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for such surgery. We considered this patient to have a normal low risk for perioperative infection. The gynecological surgery itself is a kind of trauma and is considered to increase the likelihood of severe infection. The patient was assumed to switch to an immunocompromising condition postoperatively. Given the CT results from her readmission, we suspected her febrile condition to be either a recurrence of her endometrial cancer or a peritoneal tuberculosis. However, it was revealed by blood culture to be a septic infection due to G. morbillorum, accompanied with ascites and pleural effusion. We think that a likely scenario for this septicemia is that G. morbillorum, a normal flora in her genital tract, gained access to the blood stream when the genital tract was incised during the hysterectomy. Bacteria could not be isolated from the ascites or pleural effusion; however, these fluids were obtained only after administration of antibiotics. Alternatively, her peritonitis and pleuritis might have been provoked in response to the bacteremia, producing the ascites and pleural effusion. The nodules in the peritoneum detected by CT were presumed to be thickened peritoneum resulting from inflammation. For early stage endometrial cancer, laparoscopic hysterectomy is becoming standard as a less invasive and equally curable procedure in comparison with abdominal hysterectomy. It is also considered to reduce the opportunity of postoperative infection. During laparoscopic surgery for endometrial cancer, we do not normally dilate the uterine cervix, or insert the manipulator into the uterine cavity. However, in laparoscopic surgery for benign uterine diseases, the surgeon usually does insert the manipulator into the cavity of the uterus. This insertion would increase the risk of injury to the uterine capillary blood vessels, inviting septicemia. Surgeons in such cases should therefore give greater attention to the spread of normal flora microbes into the blood stream. We conclude that the genital tract should be better cleaned and sterilized before surgery."}]},{"title":"Gemella morbillorum prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Gemella morbillorum is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"153-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-positive","answer_start":47,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can G. morbillorum cause?","id":"153-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"prosthetic valve endocarditis","answer_start":905,"id":1},{"text":"bacteraemia","answer_start":1037,"id":2},{"text":"infectious endocarditis","answer_start":980,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Gemella morbillorum's requirement for oxygen?","id":"153-2-1-3","answers":[{"text":"facultative anaerobic","answer_start":24,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Gemella morbillorum?","id":"153-2-1-4","answers":[{"text":"cocci","answer_start":61,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Gemella morbillorum is facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive cocci and are a commensal part of human flora.

Twenty-four cases of endocarditis were reported in the literature up to 2010 [2]. Predisposing factors for endocarditis include dental hygiene, dental procedures, colon malignities, inflammatory intestinal disorders, gastrointestinal diagnostic procedures such as colonoscopy, preexisting cardiac pathologies (valvular lesions, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and cardiac myxoma), steroid treatment, and diabetes mellitus [2, 4, 5]. While investigating anemia in our patient, gastroscopy and colonoscopy were detected to be predisposing factors. A majority of the G. morbillorum isolates isolated from various clinical samples are reported to be susceptible to penicillin G and ampicillin. However, in the subsequent years, several penicillin- and macrolid-resistant strains were detected [4]. In most of the cases, bacteriologic cure was achieved with penicillin G + aminoglycoside combination. Vancomycin or erythromycin + rifampicin combination is effective in the presence of in vitro penicillin resistance or in beta-lactam allergic cases [6]. IV vancomycin was used for 6 weeks in two beta-lactam and aminoglycoside-resistant cases; while one achieved a complete cure, the other underwent valvular replacement upon experiencing septic emboli [1]. Linezolid may be used in cases of penicillin, aminoglycoside, and vancomycin resistance [5]. In our case, G. morbillorum was susceptible to all antibiotics in the antibiogram; however since the spleen abscess could not be excluded, treatment with ampicillin-sulbactam + gentamicin was preferred. The patient was shifted to meropenem + vancomycin treatment upon failure to achieve inadequate response to this treatment. However operation was decided to be performed since acute cerebral emboli developed. In a penicillin-resistant patient, who developed agranulocytosis with piperacillin and acute renal failure with cefoperazone sodium, 4-week cefotiam dihydrochloride treatment was administered; however cure was achieved by performing aortic valvular replacement upon occurrence of cardiac failure [6]. ECHO performed upon detecting persistent fever in a Japanese patient, who has received dental treatment 6 months ago, revealed vegetation on the aortic and mitral valve and penicillin G 18 million U\/day and diuretic and cardiotonic agent treatment was initiated. The patient with no response to medical treatment, who developed penicillin-associated granulocytopenia on the 35th day and underwent appendicitis operation, was discharged on the 101st day following mitral and aortic valvular replacement. This was reported to be the first case of G. morbillorum endocarditis in Japan [7]. Urgent surgical treatment is recommended in cases of progressive cardiac failure, large vegetations that could be an embolic source, reaction to antibiotics, and lack of response to antibiotic treatment [1, 5, 6]. In a 67-year-old male patient undergoing hemodialysis due to chronic renal failure, medical treatment with intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin was initiated upon occurrence of G. morbillorum-associated aortic and mitral valve endocarditis; decision to continue this treatment for a couple of weeks before surgery was made; however the patient died due to acute myocardial infraction [5]. In our patient for whom medical treatment was planned by the cardiovascular surgery clinic, no reduction in vegetation was detected despite the 4-week treatment, and surgical treatment was indicated upon occurrence of emboli. A case of G. morbillorum endocarditis in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection and intravenous substance addiction, who had received mitral valvular replacement 9 months ago, was successfully treated with ceftriaxone (4 weeks) and gentamicin (2 weeks) [8]. Similarly, in a patient, who had previously received valvular replacement with the diagnosis of congenital bicuspid aortic valve, penicillin G and rifampicin were administered for 6 weeks and gentamicin was administered for 2 weeks with the diagnosis of endocarditis established upon G. morbillorum growth and complete recovery was achieved [4]. In a case report of prosthetic valvular endocarditis by Obadah Al Chekakie [9], G. morbillorum was reported to potentially lead to progressive and life-threatening cardiac failure. A 87-year-old male patient was treated under the diagnosis of G. morbillorum-associated native valvular endocarditis with no predisposing factor detected [10]. In conclusion, physicians should consider the fact that rare pathogens such as G. morbillorum could lead to endocarditis, particularly in the presence of predisposing factors. The potential requirement for urgent surgical treatment despite a good response to medical treatment should also be kept in mind."}]}]},{"species":"Gordonia bronchialis","docs":[{"title":"Peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis caused by Gordonia bronchialis: first pediatric report","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Gordonia bronchialis is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"154-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-positive","answer_start":45,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Gordonia bronchialis cause?","id":"154-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"PD-related peritonitis","answer_start":187,"id":1},{"text":"PD peritonitis","answer_start":1588,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Gordonia bronchialis's requirement for oxygen?","id":"154-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"aerobic","answer_start":18,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Gordonia bronchialis?","id":"154-1-1-4","answers":[{"text":"bacilli","answer_start":59,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Gordonia species, aerobic, weakly acid-fast, Gram-positive bacilli, are a rare cause of peritonitis in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD).

The reported infections caused by these species include endocarditis, pleural infection, and peritonitis [3, 4]. Gordonia species are known to be opportunistic pathogens, and infections often occur in immunocompromised patients. They were first reported by Tsukamura in 1971, who described a new genus Gordona (in honor of the bacterial systematist Ruth E. Gordon) including weakly acid-fast organisms acquired from sputa of patients with pulmonary disease and in soil [11]. This genus was then renamed Gordonia in 1997 [12]. Gordonia bronchialis are usually found in soil, sludge, prosthetic materials, and other environments. Peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis caused by these species has been reported in the adult literature [6, 7], with the first case of Gordonia bronchialis described by Sukackiene et al. in 2017 in a 32-year-old male farmer on CCPD [5]. The PD catheter was removed in 7 of the 11 reported cases, and most of them (5 of the 7) were able to resume PD successfully [7]. Microbiologic diagnosis is difficult, and they are commonly misidentified as other actinomycetes or mycobacteria. 16S rRNA and secA1 gene sequencing are currently the most accurate ways to identify Gordonia species [9, 10]. Our patient represents the first reported pediatric PD-related infection. The 2012 International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) pediatric guidelines do not include any specific recommendation for treating Gordonia sp. infections [13]. Empiric IP vancomycin is the most frequent treatment reported, while the subsequent antibiotic choice is guided by in vitro susceptibility testing. The duration of therapy is unclear and should be established based on clinical response and the immunosuppression status of the patient. In our patient, the ID team suggestion to administer IP vancomycin as monotherapy to treat the first episode was successful. The choice to add oral ciprofloxacin was related to susceptibility testing and good oral bioavailability, in the absence of susceptibility data for vancomycin, despite the excellent clinical response. Unfortunately, a relapse occurred within a few weeks, leading to PD catheter removal. From a pathogenic perspective, the ability of Gordonia species to create a biofilm could explain the difficulty to eradicate the infection from the PD catheter. Adhesive properties are apparently due to the presence of type B peptidoglycan, long aliphatic chains of the mycolic acids within the cell wall which, together with production of biosurfactants, are important factors in biofilm formation on hydrophobic surfaces to which they adhere [8, 14]. The source of Gordonia bronchialis infection in our patient remains unclear. Despite a remote history of PTLD, she had no evidence of immune dysfunction. She did not travel or visit a farm. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, her father was avoiding \u201cdelivery in person\u201d of the PD solution, so the PD supplies were delivered to and stored in his garage. Given that Gordonia bronchialis are widespread in the environment, the infection could be related to contamination during storage."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Gordonia bronchialis cause?","id":"154-1-4-1","answers":[{"text":"PD-related peritonitis","answer_start":0,"id":1},{"text":"PD-related peritonitis","answer_start":205,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"PD-related peritonitis caused by Gordonia bronchialis is uncommon in the adult PD population, and no cases have been reported in children to date.

Duration of therapy should be a minimum of 2 weeks and possibly longer depending on the timing of catheter exchange following initial management. As an alternative, 3 weeks of IP antibiotic treatment should be completed, and maneuvers to eliminate the biofilm, such as intraluminal catheter treatment with tissue plasminogen activator, should be considered [15].

Gordonia species infection is very rare but can cause systemic infections in immunocompromised patients [7, 15] and local infections in immunocompetent patients [16, 17]. A review of the previously reported cases of invasive Gordonia infection showed that more than 80% of cases were likely to have been catheter related [18]. Immunocompromise and the use of a catheter are factors that cause an increased likelihood of infections by Gordonia species. As the number of recognized species of aerobic actinomycetes is rapidly increasing, assessment of the clinical significance of specific species is becoming increasingly important. Pathogen identification at the species level is closely related to pathogenicity, antimicrobial susceptibility, and the type of disease produced, and thus needs to be done accurately. Although Gordonia infection is clinically very important, it can be misidentified either because the isolate is considered to be an insignificant coryneform Gram-positive rod [18] or because it is mistakenly designated by routine biochemical tests as Nocardia or Rhodococcus [8]. Therefore, 16S rDNA or hsp65 gene sequencing is needed for identification of Gordonia species to the species level. Although MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry allows the rapid identification of aerobic actinomycetes from cultured colonies with a very short turnaround time, the isolate yielded log score between < 2 and \u2265 1.7 and thus could not be identified to species level. A specific antibiotic treatment for G. bronchialis infection has not yet been standardized. Nonetheless, there is a precedent case in which ciprofloxacin and minocycline were used to treat G. bronchialis infection [6]. Moreover, another published report has recommended the use of carbapenem or a fluoroquinolone in combination with an aminoglycoside [18]. Therefore, as antibiotic treatment standards for Gordonia species are still somewhat controversial, the reporting of the MIC value as a pertinent threshold is still needed. Penicillin, which was used for the patient in this report, had poor activity against Gordonia species, with 70% of tested isolates being susceptible [18]. The organism was preliminarily identified as an actinomycete so the physician believed the organism was an anaerobic actinomycete, and changed antibiotics to penicillin G for empirical therapy. After 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene sequencing, the organism was finally reported as G. bronchialis so the patient was subsequently transitioned to imipenem administration. Communication between physicians is important following preliminary identification of the organism. To our knowledge, this is the first case of infection caused by G. bronchialis in a Korean subject. Arduous efforts to identify clinically significant pathogens are needed to enable appropriate treatment choices. In conclusion, we report the case of G. bronchialis sternal osteomyelitis. In clinical laboratory testing, 16S rRNA or hsp65 gene sequencing was required to identify aerobic actinomycetes at the species level."}]},{"title":"Sternal wound infection caused by Gordonia bronchialis: identification by MALDI-TOF MS","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Gordonia bronchialis cause?","id":"154-4-1-1","answers":[{"text":"persistent wound infection","answer_start":525,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"  Introduction:  Gordonia spp. infections are uncommon.

She reported decreased range of motion and difficulty ambulating. She denied constitutional symptoms or fever. She had undergone intra-articular steroid injection of her right hip three days prior. Review of systems was otherwise unremarkable. Her past medical history was relevant for hereditary spherocytosis with splenectomy at age 14 and chronic right hip osteoarthritis. Her only medication was celecoxib as needed. She denied any drug allergy. She was unaware of her immunization history. She worked as a flight attendant, denied smoking or recreational drug use, and had not recently travelled outside of Canada. On initial examination she was afebrile and her vital signs were within normal limits. On examination of her right hip she had limitation of internal rotation with reproducible pain, but her physical exam otherwise was unremarkable. Her initial investigations showed elevation in C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at 22.9 mg\/L and 25 mm\/hr, respectively. Her white blood cell count was not elevated. An X-ray of her right hip showed severe joint space narrowing with osteophytosis consistent with severe osteoarthritis. Arthrocentesis was performed and synovial fluid samples were directly inoculated onto solid culture media, including blood agar and chocolate agar. Two of three samples also underwent cytospin centrifugation and direct Gram stain. Gram-negative bacilli were observed in one sample though heavy neutrophils were observed in both. Synovial fluid analysis for cell count and chemistry was not performed due to insufficient sample. She was admitted to hospital for 24 hours of observation and was subsequently discharged with instructions to return to hospital if her symptoms worsened or if cultures subsequently grew a pathogenic organism. Three days later she was seen in a follow-up clinic. In the interim she had developed a fever (38.3\u00b0C), had chills, and had worsening right hip pain. Repeat physical examination showed deterioration in range of motion at her right hip with significant pain. Cardiovascular examination was unremarkable with no appreciable murmur. Synovial fluid cultures from the initial arthrocentesis were now growing Haemophilus parainfluenzae with colonies observed on solid media within 24 hours of inoculation. She received one dose of ceftriaxone and subsequently underwent right hip arthrotomy with synovectomy and irrigation. The Infectious Disease service was consulted the following day. The organism was susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefuroxime and resistant to ampicillin and ciprofloxacin (Table 1). Blood cultures and intraoperative tissue cultures did not demonstrate growth, likely due to the administration of antibiotics prior to collection. The patient was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and was subsequently discharged with outpatient follow-up for home intravenous antibiotics. Ongoing pain, difficulty ambulating, and persistently elevated inflammatory markers necessitated a prolonged, nine-week course of antimicrobial therapy (Figure 1). At the time of treatment discontinuation, she reported pain and her functional ability had not yet returned to baseline. She is currently awaiting evaluation for total hip arthroplasty.

It can be differentiated from other Haemophilus spp. by the requirement for V factor (i.e., NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) for growth [1]. H. parainfluenzae is part of the normal flora of the oral cavity and respiratory tract [1]. It is an increasingly recognized opportunistic pathogen in serious infections such as endocarditis, meningitis, and pneumonia and has also been recognized as a rare cause of nongonococcal urethritis [2]. However, it is an uncommon pathogen in osteomyelitis and septic arthritis. Inclusive of our case, there have been only 16 cases of bone and joint infections caused by H. parainfluenzae reported in the English literature (summarized in Table 2) [3\u201316]. Of these 16 patients, 10 (63%) had septic arthritis, four (25%) had osteomyelitis, and two (13%) had both septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. The median age was 65 (Interquartile Range [IQR]: 46\u201376) and 63% were male. Most (14\/16, 88%) were immunocompetent and only one reported recent trauma [14]. Four patients (25%) had prosthetic joint infections. Most patients (10\/16, 63%) reported a procedure in the previous three months (four dental, two nasopharyngeal, two gastrointestinal, one total knee arthroplasty, and one intra-articular steroid injection). The organism was identified on culture of aspirated synovial fluid (6\/16, 38%), blood (4\/16, 25%), and surgical or biopsy specimens (7\/16, 44%). 8\/16 (50%) of patients required surgical intervention and the rest (8\/16, 50%) were managed with antibiotics alone. One patient with a prosthetic joint infection was treated with chronic, suppressive antibiotic therapy after having refused surgical intervention [10]. The median length of antibiotic therapy was 42 days (IQR: 14\u201370). Of patients with data reported, most (11\/14, 79%) were treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic, the most common being ampicillin (7\/14, 50%). Summary of previously reported cases of bone and joint infections caused by Haemophilus parainfluenzae.  In the previous three months; acromioclavicular joint, sacroiliac joint,total knee arthroplasty, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, human immunodeficiency virus, cerebrospinal fluid, total hip arthroplasty, and trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole. To our knowledge, we report the first case of septic arthritis due to a beta-lactamase producing strain of H. parainfluenzae (Table 1). Community surveillance studies of Haemophilus spp. isolated from respiratory samples have reported rates of beta-lactamase production as high as 70% [17, 18]. Beta-lactamase plasmids can transmit from less pathogenic strains of Haemophilus, such as H. parainfluenzae, to invasive pathogens such as Haemophilus influenza type b, suggesting H. parainfluenzae may be a reservoir for antimicrobial resistance in the nasopharyngeal tract [18]. More recently, increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance have also been reported in genitourinary isolates of H. parainfluenzae [2, 19]. Moreover, it is well known that immunocompromised hosts are particularly susceptible to opportunistic pathogens, and it is within this context that we report the first case of septic arthritis due to H. parainfluenzae in a patient with asplenia. Patients with asplenia are at significant increased risk of sepsis due to encapsulated bacteria, such as Haemophilus spp., Neisseria spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae [20]. Immunizations for pneumococcal disease, Haemophilus influenzae type b infection, and meningococcal disease are recommended for asplenic patients. However, they remain susceptible to less common potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as H. parainfluenzae. Prompt recognition and source control (e.g., surgical debridement) are particularly important in preventing disseminated infection in patients with asplenia. In our case, given her risk of disseminated infection, surgical intervention and antibiotics could have been initiated sooner, when Gram stain of the initial arthrocentesis was reported. To the best of our knowledge, our case is the only example of H. parainfluenzae septic arthritis temporally associated with intra-articular steroid injection that is described in the literature. Septic arthritis is a rare but recognized complication following intra-articular steroid injection. Infection may result from lack of adherence to proper aseptic technique during the procedure and subsequent inoculation of the joint space, or through microbiological contamination of the steroid preparation used [21, 22]. Alternatively, transient bacteremia can lead to secondary seeding of a susceptible joint capsule, for example, in patients with underlying osteoarthritis or previous joint infection. However, localized immunosuppression from intra-articular steroid injections does not appear to be associated with increased rates of deep infection as demonstrated in patients receiving steroid injection prior to joint arthroplasty [23, 24].  H. parainfluenzae is an uncommon though increasingly recognized pathogen in bone and joint infections. In this series, patients with prosthetic joints and patients undergoing invasive procedures appear to be particularly susceptible to this pathogen. Furthermore, the rate of beta-lactamase producing strains of H. parainfluenzae may be increasing. Thus, accurate microbiologic diagnosis is key to providing tailored antibiotics, as patients often require a prolonged course of therapy."}]}]},{"species":"Haemophilus haemolyticus","docs":[{"title":"Haemophilus haemolyticus isolates causing clinical disease","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Haemophilus haemolyticus normally exist?","id":"156-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"respiratory tract","answer_start":75,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can H. haemolyticus cause?","id":"156-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"endocarditis","answer_start":8603,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of H. haemolyticus?","id":"156-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":9050,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Haemophilus haemolyticus is a human commensal bacterium that colonizes the respiratory tract (15). H. haemolyticus is closely related to the human pathogen Haemophilus influenzae but has rarely been reported to cause invasive disease. H. haemolyticus and H. influenzae differ from other Haemophilus species because they require hemin (X factor) and NAD (V factor) for growth. H. haemolyticus can easily be distinguished from encapsulated H. influenzae because H. influenzae isolates produce one of the six structurally distinct capsules that can be easily determined by slide agglutination assay, whereas H. haemolyticus has never been shown to produce a capsule. However, due to the high similarity in morphology, biochemistry, and genetics between H. haemolyticus and nonencapsulated or nontypeable H. influenzae, distinguishing the two by standard microbiology methods has been challenging. The presence of one or more of the following four features has been used for differentiating H. haemolyticus from nontypeable H. influenzae. (i) H. haemolyticus induces clear \u03b2-hemolysis on horse blood agar. However, the hemolytic activity may be lost due to multiple subcultures or other unknown mechanisms, and nonhemolytic H. haemolyticus strains are often misidentified as nontypeable H. influenzae (13, 15\u201318). (ii) More than 90% of H. haemolyticus strains produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S); a small proportion of H. influenzae biotype IV strains produce H2S (8, 10, 19). Therefore, production of H2S cannot unambiguously distinguish H. haemolyticus from H. influenzae. (ii) H. influenzae can be distinguished by PCR assays detecting the genes coding for protein D (hpd) and the fuculose kinase gene (fucK); a negative PCR result for both hpd and fucK genes is a strong indication of H. haemolyticus (17, 18, 23, 24). (iv) 16S rRNA gene sequences of H. haemolyticus and H. influenzae form different phylogenetic clusters. Recent studies have demonstrated that use of both phenotypic and genotypic assays improves identification of H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus isolated from asymptomatic carriers (23). To determine whether H. haemolyticus invasive disease has been overlooked due to its high similarity to nontypeable H. influenzae, we characterized isolates from cases reported to be caused by nontypeable H. influenzae that were submitted to the CDC through routine surveillance in 2010 or through a population-based Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) program (http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/abcs\/index.htm) in 1999, 2000, 2009, and 2010 in the United States. A total of 161 isolates from 2009 to 2010 and 213 isolates from 1999 to 2000 were characterized using phenotypic assays, including Kovac's oxidase test, API NH strips (bioM\u00e9rieux; Durham, NC), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) test strips (Sigma-Aldrich, Allentown, PA), and Haemophilus ID Quad plates (Remel, Lenexa, KS). These isolates were further characterized using the hpd and fucK PCR assays that detect internal regions of the two genes (9, 17, 18). All isolates showed typical H. influenzae colony morphology, were positive for oxidase, required heme and NAD factors for growth, and produced hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The isolates from cases 1 to 5 showed hemolytic activity on Haemophilus ID Quad plates; other isolates (cases 6 and 7) were nonhemolytic. All seven isolates were negative for hpd and fucK by specific PCR assays. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was conducted on the seven isolates as described previously (20). Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences were conducted using MEGA version 4 using the neighbor-joining method (22). Bootstrap numbers are from 1,000 replicates. 16S rRNA gene sequences of these isolates were compared with those of 10 H. haemolyticus isolates, 18 H. influenzae isolates, and 10 isolates representing Haemophilus species other than H. haemolyticus and H. influenzae that were published in GenBank and the Ribosomal Database Project (http:\/\/rdp.cme.msu.edu\/) (20). As shown in Fig. 1, isolates of the same species generally formed a group. The organisms from cases 1 to 7 were grouped with other known H. haemolyticus but not H. influenzae strains. Based on the profile of these phenotypic and genotypic laboratory tests, the seven isolates from cases 1 to 7 were identified as H. haemolyticus. Genome sequences of isolates from case 6 ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AFQR00000000\",\"term_id\":\"341956943\",\"term_text\":\"AFQR00000000\"}}AFQR00000000) and 7 ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AFQQ00000000\",\"term_id\":\"341955788\",\"term_text\":\"AFQQ00000000\"}}AFQQ00000000) have recently been published (9). The fucK gene is missing, but the hpd gene is present in these two isolates, suggesting that the PCR target region of the hpd gene is species specific.

Haemophilus paraphrohaemolyticus is the type strain from NCTC, and Haemophilus parasuis was from an unpublished source. All seven patients infected with H. haemolyticus had different symptoms and presentations (Table 1). Two of the seven H. haemolyticus cases were from California and Oregon in 1999 and five cases were from Connecticut, Georgia, Minnesota, Illinois, and Texas in 2009 to 2010. All seven patients were hospitalized with no deaths. Isolates were recovered from 5 blood, 1 synovial fluid, and 1 pancreatic specimen (Table 1). Five of the seven isolates were submitted to the CDC through the ABCs program. The other two isolates from Illinois and Texas were collected from routine surveillance and submitted for confirmation of species identification. Summary of clinical and laboratory results for the seven cases Haemophilus species other than H. influenzae and H. ducreyi are not common human pathogens (1, 21). Only a few bacteremia cases caused by non-H. influenzae Haemophilus species have been reported (3, 6). Two endocarditis cases caused by H. haemolyticus were reported in 1923 and in 1933 (5, 14). Our clinical and laboratory findings indicate that H. haemolyticus is associated with invasive clinical disease. Six patients had underlying medical conditions or recent surgical procedures that could have compromised their immune systems, potentially increasing their risk for invasive H. haemolyticus infection. H. haemolyticus may cause disease more as an opportunistic pathogen. Little is known about the mechanisms of H. haemolyticus pathogenicity. Capsule is considered a crucial virulence factor for many bacterial pathogens, such as H. influenzae (11); however, H. haemolyticus has not been reported to produce capsule. H. influenzae outer membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharide of H. influenzae play important roles in bacterial colonization and evasion of host defenses (7). Because of the high frequency of horizontal gene transfer among and between Haemophilus species, it is conceivable that the homologues of H. influenzae virulent factors may be present in H. haemolyticus and play a role in H. haemolyticus pathogenicity. Future work is necessary to define the virulent determinants of H. haemolyticus and the role of hemolysin as a virulence factor. Our study also indicates that molecular tools are useful for discriminating H. haemolyticus from nontypeable H. influenzae when the phenotypic assays are unable to provide conclusive results (23). Detection of the two H. haemolyticus cases from 1999 suggests that disease caused by H. haemolyticus has been historically overlooked; H. haemolyticus cases have previously been misidentified as nontypeable H. influenzae cases due to the lack of proper detection methods. In addition to the hpd and fucK genes, other biomarker genes have been proposed to differentiate H. haemolyticus from H. influenzae, such as the H. influenzae adherence and penetration protein gene hap, the [Cu, Zn]superoxide dismutase gene sodC, the immunoglobulin A protease gene iga, and the outer membrane protein P6 (4, 13, 16\u201318, 24). The hpd and iga genes are more reliable than the fucK, hap, sodC, and protein P6 genes for distinguishing the two organisms (2, 4, 12\u201314, 23, 24). 16S rRNA gene sequencing is used for identification of bacterial species (20), but the low bootstrap value (Fig. 1) has suggested that single gene sequences may not be able to phylogenetically discriminate H. haemolyticus and H. influenzae. McCrea et al. have shown that concatenated sequences of multiple genes, including the 16S rRNA gene, adk (adenylate kinase gene), pgi (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase gene), recA (recombination protein gene), and infB (translation initiation factor 2 gene), separate the two species into distinct clusters (13). As no single trait is able to unequivocally discriminate H. haemolyticus and H. influenzae, a testing scheme that includes reliable molecular techniques such as the hpd- and iga-based PCR assays can be used in combination with standard microbiological methods in order to improve the identification of H. haemolyticus."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Haemophilus haemolyticus normally exist?","id":"156-1-2-1","answers":[{"text":"respiratory tract","answer_start":75,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can H. haemolyticus cause?","id":"156-1-2-2","answers":[{"text":"endocarditis","answer_start":8603,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of H. haemolyticus?","id":"156-1-2-3","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":9050,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Haemophilus haemolyticus is a human commensal bacterium that colonizes the respiratory tract (15).

The presence of one or more of the following four features has been used for differentiating H. haemolyticus from nontypeable H. influenzae. (i) H. haemolyticus induces clear \u03b2-hemolysis on horse blood agar. However, the hemolytic activity may be lost due to multiple subcultures or other unknown mechanisms, and nonhemolytic H. haemolyticus strains are often misidentified as nontypeable H. influenzae (13, 15\u201318). (ii) More than 90% of H. haemolyticus strains produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S); a small proportion of H. influenzae biotype IV strains produce H2S (8, 10, 19). Therefore, production of H2S cannot unambiguously distinguish H. haemolyticus from H. influenzae. (ii) H. influenzae can be distinguished by PCR assays detecting the genes coding for protein D (hpd) and the fuculose kinase gene (fucK); a negative PCR result for both hpd and fucK genes is a strong indication of H. haemolyticus (17, 18, 23, 24). (iv) 16S rRNA gene sequences of H. haemolyticus and H. influenzae form different phylogenetic clusters. Recent studies have demonstrated that use of both phenotypic and genotypic assays improves identification of H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus isolated from asymptomatic carriers (23). To determine whether H. haemolyticus invasive disease has been overlooked due to its high similarity to nontypeable H. influenzae, we characterized isolates from cases reported to be caused by nontypeable H. influenzae that were submitted to the CDC through routine surveillance in 2010 or through a population-based Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) program (http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/abcs\/index.htm) in 1999, 2000, 2009, and 2010 in the United States. A total of 161 isolates from 2009 to 2010 and 213 isolates from 1999 to 2000 were characterized using phenotypic assays, including Kovac's oxidase test, API NH strips (bioM\u00e9rieux; Durham, NC), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) test strips (Sigma-Aldrich, Allentown, PA), and Haemophilus ID Quad plates (Remel, Lenexa, KS). These isolates were further characterized using the hpd and fucK PCR assays that detect internal regions of the two genes (9, 17, 18). All isolates showed typical H. influenzae colony morphology, were positive for oxidase, required heme and NAD factors for growth, and produced hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The isolates from cases 1 to 5 showed hemolytic activity on Haemophilus ID Quad plates; other isolates (cases 6 and 7) were nonhemolytic. All seven isolates were negative for hpd and fucK by specific PCR assays. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was conducted on the seven isolates as described previously (20). Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences were conducted using MEGA version 4 using the neighbor-joining method (22). Bootstrap numbers are from 1,000 replicates. 16S rRNA gene sequences of these isolates were compared with those of 10 H. haemolyticus isolates, 18 H. influenzae isolates, and 10 isolates representing Haemophilus species other than H. haemolyticus and H. influenzae that were published in GenBank and the Ribosomal Database Project (http:\/\/rdp.cme.msu.edu\/) (20). As shown in Fig. 1, isolates of the same species generally formed a group. The organisms from cases 1 to 7 were grouped with other known H. haemolyticus but not H. influenzae strains. Based on the profile of these phenotypic and genotypic laboratory tests, the seven isolates from cases 1 to 7 were identified as H. haemolyticus. Genome sequences of isolates from case 6 ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AFQR00000000\",\"term_id\":\"341956943\",\"term_text\":\"AFQR00000000\"}}AFQR00000000) and 7 ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AFQQ00000000\",\"term_id\":\"341955788\",\"term_text\":\"AFQQ00000000\"}}AFQQ00000000) have recently been published (9). The fucK gene is missing, but the hpd gene is present in these two isolates, suggesting that the PCR target region of the hpd gene is species specific.

Haemophilus paraphrohaemolyticus is the type strain from NCTC, and Haemophilus parasuis was from an unpublished source. All seven patients infected with H. haemolyticus had different symptoms and presentations (Table 1). Two of the seven H. haemolyticus cases were from California and Oregon in 1999 and five cases were from Connecticut, Georgia, Minnesota, Illinois, and Texas in 2009 to 2010. All seven patients were hospitalized with no deaths. Isolates were recovered from 5 blood, 1 synovial fluid, and 1 pancreatic specimen (Table 1). Five of the seven isolates were submitted to the CDC through the ABCs program. The other two isolates from Illinois and Texas were collected from routine surveillance and submitted for confirmation of species identification. Summary of clinical and laboratory results for the seven cases Haemophilus species other than H. influenzae and H. ducreyi are not common human pathogens (1, 21). Only a few bacteremia cases caused by non-H. influenzae Haemophilus species have been reported (3, 6). Two endocarditis cases caused by H. haemolyticus were reported in 1923 and in 1933 (5, 14). Our clinical and laboratory findings indicate that H. haemolyticus is associated with invasive clinical disease. Six patients had underlying medical conditions or recent surgical procedures that could have compromised their immune systems, potentially increasing their risk for invasive H. haemolyticus infection. H. haemolyticus may cause disease more as an opportunistic pathogen. Little is known about the mechanisms of H. haemolyticus pathogenicity. Capsule is considered a crucial virulence factor for many bacterial pathogens, such as H. influenzae (11); however, H. haemolyticus has not been reported to produce capsule. H. influenzae outer membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharide of H. influenzae play important roles in bacterial colonization and evasion of host defenses (7). Because of the high frequency of horizontal gene transfer among and between Haemophilus species, it is conceivable that the homologues of H. influenzae virulent factors may be present in H. haemolyticus and play a role in H. haemolyticus pathogenicity. Future work is necessary to define the virulent determinants of H. haemolyticus and the role of hemolysin as a virulence factor. Our study also indicates that molecular tools are useful for discriminating H. haemolyticus from nontypeable H. influenzae when the phenotypic assays are unable to provide conclusive results (23). Detection of the two H. haemolyticus cases from 1999 suggests that disease caused by H. haemolyticus has been historically overlooked; H. haemolyticus cases have previously been misidentified as nontypeable H. influenzae cases due to the lack of proper detection methods. In addition to the hpd and fucK genes, other biomarker genes have been proposed to differentiate H. haemolyticus from H. influenzae, such as the H. influenzae adherence and penetration protein gene hap, the [Cu, Zn]superoxide dismutase gene sodC, the immunoglobulin A protease gene iga, and the outer membrane protein P6 (4, 13, 16\u201318, 24). The hpd and iga genes are more reliable than the fucK, hap, sodC, and protein P6 genes for distinguishing the two organisms (2, 4, 12\u201314, 23, 24). 16S rRNA gene sequencing is used for identification of bacterial species (20), but the low bootstrap value (Fig. 1) has suggested that single gene sequences may not be able to phylogenetically discriminate H. haemolyticus and H. influenzae. McCrea et al. have shown that concatenated sequences of multiple genes, including the 16S rRNA gene, adk (adenylate kinase gene), pgi (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase gene), recA (recombination protein gene), and infB (translation initiation factor 2 gene), separate the two species into distinct clusters (13). As no single trait is able to unequivocally discriminate H. haemolyticus and H. influenzae, a testing scheme that includes reliable molecular techniques such as the hpd- and iga-based PCR assays can be used in combination with standard microbiological methods in order to improve the identification of H. haemolyticus."}]}]},{"species":"Haemophilus sputorum","docs":[{"title":"Emergence of genital infections due to Haemophilus pittmaniae and Haemophilus sputorum","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Haemophilus sputorum cause?","id":"157-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"urethritis","answer_start":116,"id":1},{"text":"genital system infections","answer_start":1038,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are H. sputorum sensitive to?","id":"157-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"ampicillin, cefixime, and trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole","answer_start":656,"id":1},{"text":"moxifloxacin","answer_start":783,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"  Background:  We report for the first time the association of Haemophilus pittmaniae and Haemophilus sputorum with urethritis in men who have sex with men and who engage in unprotected intercourse.

Normally found in bowel of man and animals, water and soil, infections with these bacteria are leading to prolonged stays in hospitals. Multiple comorbidities and compromised immune status along with exposures to multiple antibiotics are main factors that increase the risks for infections and drug resistance. Colonization of the respiratory and the gastro-intestinal tract is common in hospitalised patients. Thus, Klebsiella species are often a cause of bronchopneumonia, urinary tract infection and septicaemia in admitted patients. This bacterium has the ability to cause outbreaks of nosocomial infection as it often exchanges plasmid-borne resistance with other bacteria, which are more common at tertiary and specialized centres. Klebsiella pneumoniae is the single, predominant species gaining more significance as it is developing multidrug resistance at tertiary care centres similar to Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter. Among the Klebsiella, K. oxytoca is now being isolated more frequently. This was earlier named Bacterium oxytocum by Flugge in 1886 and is an organism that forms indole, has a positive Voges\u2013Proskauer reaction and liquefies gelatine along with other features of Klebsiella species. K. oxytoca is normally acquired from environmental sources. Some previous studies have concluded its pathogenic significance in sputum and blood culture in a few patients, while uncertain in others, more so in respiratory infections. K. oxytoca has been isolated from different clinical samples mainly from the blood and respiratory secretions, and is gaining clinical significance in immunocompromised and debilitated patients admitted in Intensive Critical Care Units (ICUs). Further, different mechanisms are involved in development of multidrug resistance. These include production of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC lactamases, Klebsiella pneumonia carbapenemase (KPC) and aminoglycosides-modifying enzymes. Modi et al. have reported 89% ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates on screening done in a neonatal care unit at a tertiary care centre. KPC are encoded by the gene blaKPC, which has the potential to get transferred from one species to other Gram-negative bacteria. These KPC-producing bacteria have been found to be less sensitive to aminoglycosides and quinolones. Production of metallo-\u03b2-lactamases by these bacteria, on a highly mobile gene, is further limiting the use of all \u03b2-lactam agents.

Majority of Klebsiella infections are caused by K. pneumoniae. There are mainly case reports and small case studies about K. oxytoca. In our study, we had 23 patients who had K. oxytoca infection. Earlier, it was only pseudomonas that showed high resistance to commonly used antibiotics, but now along with Acinetobacter, Klebsiella species are rapidly developing multidrug resistance. Klebsiella are opportunistic pathogens that cause severe diseases in hospital setting. This organism causes pneumonia, urinary tract infection, soft tissue infection and septicaemia, which often leads to septic shock. K. oxytoca has been isolated more frequently from neonatal ICUs in the past, but now it is being isolated even from various samples of adult patients admitted at critical care centres. It is showing multidrug resistance and is showing higher drug resistance as compared to K. pneumoniae. In our study, K. oxytoca showed higher resistance (75%) to piperacillin\/tazobactam as compared to K. pneumoniae (65%). Mechanism of piperacillin\/tazobactam resistance sometimes differs between K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca. Identified ESBLs amongst K. pneumoniae isolates were CTX-M-2, -3, -14 and -15 and SHV-12, while OXY-2 was conferred to K. oxytoca. These give different sensitivity patterns. CTX phenotype pattern has better sensitivity to piperacillin\/tazobactam, while OXY-2 ESBLs reduce sensitivity to piperacillin\/tazobactam. ESBL production by K. pneumoniae has been found variable and is being reported up to 96%. In our study, 58% of K. oxytoca isolates were KPC producers, as compared to K. pneumoniae (30%). Similar results were observed in another study were reported meropenem resistance was up to 58%. Hoenigl et al. have described a nosocomial outbreak of KPC-producing K. oxytoca, highlighting the clinical importance of infection with this microorganism. K. oxytoca infected individuals may remain asymptomatic; however, it is still considered to be an opportunistic pathogen. The clinical significance of this is now recognized by its association with nosocomial infections in cohorts of hospitalized patients, including children and neonates. KPC-producing K. pneumoniae are responsible for higher mortality as compared to non-KPC producers. We observed three isolates of K. pneumoniae that were resistant to colistin and 10 isolates showed resistance to tigecyclin, while none of K. oxytoca showed any resistance to these two antibiotics. In vitro susceptibility to polymyxins among clinical KPC-producing isolates ranges from 90 to 100%. Aminoglycosides are an important treatment option for KPC-producing organisms. It has been found that the production of carbapenemases is the most important molecular mechanism of such resistance, both epidemiologically and clinically. The data from our study show an increasing burden of infection caused by this bacterium, which is now gaining access to ICCUs, which needs to be corroborated by studies across more centres. Of clinical significance is that the organism appears to become resistant to a range of antibiotics; however, our study found that resistance had not yet set in to colistin and tigecyclin. However, pan-resistant bacteria have been reported that are resistant to tigecycline, polymixin and aminoglycosides besides carbapenems. Active surveillance of the Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria K. oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae that produce ESBL and carbapenemases enzymes is an essential function of hospital laboratories. Further, K. oxytoca has shown reduced sensitivity to the widely used antiseptic, chlorhexidine. This will undoubtedly increase the further burden of such infections in the future. Hospital Infection Control Committees must keep a close watch on K. oxytoca amongst other microorganisms of concern."}]}]},{"species":"Klebsiella variicola","docs":[{"title":"Clinical characteristics in blood stream infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella variicola, and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae: a comparative study, Japan, 2014-2017","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can K. variicola cause?","id":"160-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":526,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of K. variicola?","id":"160-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogens","answer_start":76,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Previously, K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae were often considered to be opportunistic pathogens with less virulence than K. pneumoniae in humans [14, 22].

It was suggested that other mechanisms may contribute to the hypermucoviscous phenotype in these organisms. In terms of virulence genes, significant differences in the prevalence of genes associated with iron-scavenging systems (entB, ybtS, iutA, and kfu) were recognized between K. pneumoniae, K. variicola, and K. quasipneumoniae isolates. The ability to acquire iron is essential for bacterial growth and replication, and the iron uptake system (kfu) contributes to invasive disease and could play a part in the pathogenicity of BSIs caused by K. variicola [10]. In our results, the presence of kfu was significantly higher in K. variicola isolates than in K. pneumoniae and K. quasipneumoniae isolates. It was previously reported that K. pneumoniae belonging to the K1 serotype strain has a higher prevalence of kfu than the non-K1 serotype [26, 27]. In this study, K. pneumoniae belonging to the K1 serotype carried kfu in all strains (16\/16, 100%), whereas the K2 serotype had quite low rates (3\/13, 23.0%). However, no K. variicola isolates were K1 serotypes. The carriage rates of iutA and ybtS, which produce aerobactin and yersiniabactin, respectively, were significantly higher in K. pneumoniae isolates than in K. variicola or K. quasipneumoniae isolates [9, 28, 29]. Moreover, entB was found in almost all K. pneumoniae and K. variicola isolates but only in 36.4% of K. quasipneumoniae isolates. These results suggested that K. quasipneumoniae isolates had fewer virulence genes associated with iron acquisition than K. pneumoniae or K. variicola isolates, as has been previously reported [8, 29\u201331]. On the other hand, the carriage of allS, which is associated with allantoin metabolism, was significantly higher in K. quasipneumoniae isolates (6\/11, 54.5%) than in K. pneumoniae (21\/87, 24.1%) or K. variicola (1\/21, 4.8%) isolates. These results suggested that different mechanisms could contribute in part to the pathogenicity of BSI caused by three these organisms. In this study, there were no significant differences between the three organisms in terms of clinical characteristics and impact on outcome, except for the fact that K. variicola was more frequently detected in elderly patients, and K. quasipneumoniae was found more frequently than K. pneumoniae and K. variicola in patients with malignancy in Japan. In comparing patients\u2019 backgrounds between community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections, ESBL-producing isolates and patients with malignancies were more frequently associated with BSIs in the patients who had hospital-acquired infections. Indeed, these differences have been evaluated in previous reports; however, in most studies K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae have unfortunately been misidentified as K. pneumoniae [32\u201335]. Our study showed that there was no significant difference in the rates of BSIs caused by the three types of Klebsiella species in patients with both community- and hospital-acquired infections. Moreover, differences in bacterial properties and organisms were not identified as independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. One study showed that patients with K. variicola BSI have an increased risk of mortality compared with patients with K. pneumoniae or K. quasipneumoniae BSI in Sweden [19]. This contradiction probably reflects differences in bacterial populations due to the different geographical areas. In the Swedish study, there were fewer isolates belonging to K1 (1.4%) or K2 (5.0%) serotypes than in our study, which had 13.5% K1 serotype and 10.9% K2 serotype. K1 and K2 serotypes are frequently detected in BSIs, particularly in Asia and South Africa, but less frequently in Europe and North America [36]. Several reports have shown that K1 serotype strains, especially those belonging to clonal complex 23, have a high prevalence of plasmids encoding virulence genes, such as rmpA, inuA, kfu and allS [27, 37, 38]. Furthermore, such K1 K. pneumoniae strains are known as hypervirulent K. pneumoniae. There have been a few reports with detailed surveillance data on the distribution of capsular serotypes among K. pneumoniae isolates derived from patients with invasive infections across Japan [39]. Our study showed hypervirulent K1 K. pneumoniae is frequently the cause of BSI but is not associated with mortality; similar results have been found in Taiwan and China [40, 41]. It is reported that ESBL-producing isolates are associated with higher mortality rates [42]. However, in our study, ESBL-producing isolates were confirmed in only 3 of the 119 isolates. Therefore, depending on the geographical area, additional identification of K. variicola isolates from K. pneumoniae in routine laboratory tests may not help to lower the mortality rate of patients with BSI caused by Klebsiella species. In this study, the limitations were the small sample size and low rate of mortality. A large sample size is needed to obtain better evaluation of accuracy, the prevalence of virulence genes, and further information on the differences in the clinical characteristics between K. pneumoniae, K. variicola, and K. quasipneumoniae infections."}]}]},{"species":"Klebsiella quasipneumoniae","docs":[{"title":"Clinical characteristics in blood stream infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella variicola, and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae: a comparative study, Japan, 2014-2017","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can K. quasipneumoniae cause?","id":"161-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":526,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of K. quasipneumoniae?","id":"161-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogens","answer_start":76,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Previously, K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae were often considered to be opportunistic pathogens with less virulence than K. pneumoniae in humans [14, 22].

In our study, K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae were isolated from BSI patients without underlying disease, and surprisingly, some fatal cases of bacteremia were caused by K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae (Additional file 2: Table S1). Taking these findings into consideration, it is possible that the pathogenicity of both K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae has been underestimated. Our study showed differences in the phenotypic features and the prevalence of virulence genes between K. pneumoniae, K. variicola, and K. quasipneumoniae. Among the phenotypic features, the hypermucoviscous phenotype was found not only in isolates of K. pneumoniae but also in those of K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae.

The recent identification of Kytococcus infection has been enabled by molecular sequencing or MALDI-TOF MS. An increased number of infections caused by K. schroeteri has been reported recently [7]. According to Shah\u2019s study on K. schroeteri infections, 13 of 19 cases were related to prostheses, while the others were pneumonia cases [7]. Only one case of postoperative spondylitis was reported in a female patient with diabetes. Among the 19 patients, 11 were immunocompromised. K. sedentarius is usually a skin organism that is not harmful but can be associated with infections [1,2,9]. Few K. sedentarius infections have been reported, including pneumonia in a patient with acute leukemia and two cases related to prostheses (Table 1). As K. sedentarius is normal skin commensal, breakage of the skin barrier due to prosthetics or injection therapy could lead to infection. To our knowledge, this is the first case of infectious spondylitis caused by K. sedentarius. Reported cases of Kytococcus sedentarius infection. Regarding the treatment of this strain, there are no formally established MIC breakpoints from the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) for Kytococcus species. Therefore, the MIC breakpoints should be interpreted with caution. Kytococcus species are usually resistant to methicillin and penicillin G [10] but susceptible to streptomycin, novobiocin, tetracycline, vancomycin, and polymyxin B [8]. Although there are no data on in vitro susceptibility test results of fluoroquinolones for Kytococcus spp., there are data on the in vitro activity of antibiotics for Micrococcus spp. [11,12]. According to Peters, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were equally active against all 191 micrococcal strains tested and twofold more active than ofloxacin [11]. In the present case, as the isolate was resistant to most antimicrobial agents, including vancomycin and rifampin, the patient was treated with ciprofloxacin alone. Two reported cases of K. schroeteri infections were treated with fluoroquinolones. One patient with pneumonia died with ofloxacin and ceftriaxone treatment; the other was a case of prosthetic discitis that survived with ofloxacin and rifampin treatment [7].

No strains were kept and it remained largely unknown until 1994 when Gerner-Smidt et al. [2] described a similar bacteria isolated on the gingival margin of healthy human patients. Its status as a new species was then validated as L. mirabilis, in honor of Dr. Hans Lautrop, a Danish bacteriologist who pointed out the similarity between this bacterium and \u00d8rskov's description [2]. L. mirabilis was first linked to dental plaque formation [2]. Since then, it has been identified in the oral cavity of children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus [3] (with no clinically apparent disease) and identified as the predominant microorganism in the sputum of a cystic fibrosis patient with pneumonia [4]. Even though its significance may be difficult to ascertain on these mixed flora sites, a potential for invasive disease has been proposed, as it was isolated from normally sterile sites such as blood and peritoneal fluid [5].

NPGN PD-associated peritonitis has been associated with worse outcomes than gram-positive peritonitis, with higher risks of death, relapsing infection, catheter loss, and transfer to hemodialysis [8, 9]. In our case, the patient presented with none of the above. Despite the lack of L. mirabilis isolate in the mouth, the clinical history and absence of bacteremia suggest that droplets or touch contamination may have been the vector from the oral cavity to the peritoneal cavity. Even so, confirmation of the mechanism of infection remains uncertain. Another important consideration regarding the pathogenicity of L. mirabilis is that the previous reports of infections occurred in patients with chronic, debilitating illnesses, in which the end-stage chronic kidney disease stands. This may underline a lesser virulence potential of this bacterium or dependence on other unknown host factors. We present an exceedingly rare case of L. mirabilis PD-associated peritonitis, successfully treated with IP antibiotics. Even though the pathogenicity of this bacterium is incompletely understood, this case highlights that it does have a pathogenic potential in PD patients.

The genus Leptotrichia contains a wide variety of species,such as L. buccalis, L. trevisanii, L. amnionii, L. goodfellowi, L. hofstadii, L. shahii, L. wadei, and L. hongkongensis [1, 10]. Leptotrichia species are anaerobic Gram-negative rods that inhabit the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, urogenital system and female genital tract of humans [11, 12]. Previous studies have shown that Leptotrichia species can be isolated as pathogens in endocarditis, periodontitis, chorioamnionitis, abscesses as well as wound infections after dog bites [4, 11]. Bacteremia caused by Leptotrichia species are rarely isolated from immunocompromised patients (e.g, those suffering from hematologic malignancies, cancer or acquired immune deficiency syndrome) [5, 11, 13, 14]. Leptotrichia species are not prevelant, but infection can be severe in immunosuppressed patients. Identification of Leptotrichia species can be difficult, and is likely to remain an underappreciated cause of anaerobic bloodstream infection due to the inherent difficulties associated with conventional laboratory assays [15]. Moreover, the clinical signs of infection with Leptotricha species are not specific because fever can occur in other Gram-negative bacterial infections. Therefore, misdiagnoses of infections due to Leptotrichia species with infections by Fusobacterium species, Capnocytophaga species or Lactobacillus species or the problems due to culture can obscure the clinical importance of Leptotrichia species. However, MALDI-TOF-MS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing can be employed to identify Leptotrichia species. Both of these methods are reliable and feasible for identification of some anaerobic species in microbiology laboratories that are difficult to identify using traditional phenotypic systems [6, 16]. Therefore, routine use of these new methods allows recongnition of more Leptotrichia isolates, which could also provide evidence for effective and timely therapy for patients. L. trevisanii was described first by Tee et al. in 2001 [6]. L. trevisanii grow best in anaerobic environments, but they can grow readily aerobically with 5% CO2 on blood agar, and are recongized as the most aerotolerant species of this genus [1, 11]. On blood agar, colonies appear smooth, gray, with dark central spots, measuring ~ 2 mm. Gram stain reveals unsporulated, elongated, fusiform Gram-negative bacilli. L. trevisanii has been reported in bacteremia secondary to mucositis, periodontitis, abscesses, and catheter-related bloodstream infections as well as in patients: with hematologic malignancies; who have undergone bone transplantation; with solid tumors undergoing chemotherapy; with febrile neutropenia [5\u20138, 16\u201318]. Particullarly, patients who have undergone and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and who received high-dose chemotherapy, Leptotrichia species have been identified as major pathogens of bacteremia [12]. Chorioamnionitis and pelvic inflammatory diseases have also been reported to be caused by L. trevisanii [19, 20]. Therefore, Leptotrichia species as emerging pathogens can cause Leptotrichia anaerobic bloodstream infection in immunocompromised patients. This is the first case of L. trevisanii bacteremia in a SLE patient diagnosed with methotrexate poisoning because of mis-dosing. Subsequently, she developed severe oral mucositis accompanied by neutropenia. Methotrexate poisoning is very rare, so we recommended that she take immunosuppressants according to the advice of her physician. Furthermore, not only patients with hematologic malignancies but also people with autoimmune diseases who take immunosuppressants (with the attendant loss of a normal mucosal barrier in oral or lower gastrointestinal tracts) should be considered as high-risk populations for Leptotrichia infection. Therefore, immunosuppression with severe mucositis and neutropenia are the primary risk factors for L. trevisanii bacteremia."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can L. trevisanii cause?","id":"168-1-4-1","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":55,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"In conclusion, this is the first case of L. trevisanii bacteremia in a SLE patient with methotrexate poisoning.

The best-characterized member of the genus, Legionella pneumophila, is the major causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of acute pneumonia. L. pneumophila is an intracellular pathogen, and as part of its pathogenesis, the bacteria avoid phagolysosome fusion and replicate within alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells in a vacuole that exhibits many characteristics of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The formation of the unusual L. pneumophila vacuole is a feature of its interaction with the host, yet the mechanisms by which the bacteria avoid classical endosome fusion and recruit markers of the ER are incompletely understood. Here we review the factors that contribute to the ability of L. pneumophila to infect and replicate in human cells and amoebae with an emphasis on proteins that are secreted by the bacteria into the Legionella vacuole and\/or the host cell. Many of these factors undermine eukaryotic trafficking and signaling pathways by acting as functional and, in some cases, structural mimics of eukaryotic proteins.

Overall, there were 182 cases that resulted in 29 deaths and the hospitalization of 147 people (131). Following months of intense investigation, the causative agent was identified as a Gram-negative bacillus that was subsequently termed Legionella pneumophila, its name reflecting both its victims and the newly described Legionnaires' disease (53). The discovery of Legionella in 1977 as well as the development of successive growth media provided a means for the retrospective study of previously unsolved outbreaks of respiratory disease as well as the environmental isolation of Legionella. The ability to isolate and grow the bacteria led to the rapid classification of other Legionella species associated with human pneumonia. Human bacterial isolates originally identified as rickettsia in the 1940s through the 1960s were also definitively identified as Legionella spp. by using these new techniques (121, 161). In the relatively short period since L. pneumophila was first identified as a human pathogen, more than 50 species of Legionella have been recognized, and at least 24 of these have been associated with human disease. It is possible that under the appropriate conditions, immunocompromised people can be infected with any species of Legionella. The great majority of Legionnaires' disease, approximately 90%, is caused by L. pneumophila, and despite the description of at least 15 serogroups, L. pneumophila serogroup 1 is responsible for over 84% of cases worldwide (218, 237, 362). The bias toward L. pneumophila as the most prevalent Legionella species to infect humans does not reflect the environmental distribution of the genus. A large study comparing clinical and environmental Legionella isolates in France showed that L. pneumophila serogroup 1 accounted for 28% of environmental Legionella isolates compared to 95% of clinical isolates (106). That study and similar studies provided strong evidence that L. pneumophila is more pathogenic to humans than other Legionella species. The public health impact of L. pneumophila is therefore reflected in the greater research focus on this organism. Legionella bozemanae, L. micdadei, and L. longbeachae are the next most common etiological agents of Legionnaires' disease and together account for approximately 2 to 7% of Legionella infections worldwide (237). Interestingly, this trend does not hold true for Australia and New Zealand, where approximately 30% of Legionnaires' disease is attributed to L. longbeachae (362). The remaining pathogenic species of Legionella are rarely isolated from humans, and some species are classified as pathogenic based on a single reported human infection. Legionella bacteria are ubiquitous organisms within freshwater environments (128). L. pneumophila has been recovered from a wide range of both human-made and natural aquatic habitats, from lakes and streams to air-conditioning cooling towers, fountains, and spa baths (130, 198, 235, 300, 314). The exception to this ecological niche is L. longbeachae, which resides primarily in soil, and infection is often associated with exposure to commercial potting soil (317, 318). Legionella bacteria are not free-living aquatic bacteria; rather, they parasitize or form a commensal relationship with free-living, freshwater, and soil amoebae (288, 307, 319). Legionella species multiply intracellularly in many types of protozoa, and this relationship is central to the ecology of the organism in both aquatic and soil environments. While providing a niche for Legionella replication, amoebae also protect Legionella from harsh environmental conditions. This relationship increases the resistance of L. pneumophila to biocides, antibiotics, acid, and osmotic and thermal stress (15, 31, 84, 85, 191). Furthermore, some amoebal species expel biocide-resistant vesicles containing large numbers of L. pneumophila bacteria, which may act as airborne agents for the transmission of the bacteria (40). Within human-made water systems, Legionella bacteria are found almost exclusively within complex biofilms (282). The characterization of Legionella within these ecosystems is difficult, but model biofilm systems have demonstrated that the replication of L. pneumophila within this niche depends on the presence of a protozoan host (239). Legionnaires' disease is most strongly associated with human-made aquatic environments that contain water at elevated temperatures. In particular, many disease outbreaks are linked to air-conditioning cooling towers and evaporative condensers, which can produce contaminated water droplets that are inhaled by passers by. The increased presence of these large-scale, human-made aquatic reservoirs has likely led to the increased human exposure to Legionella and subsequently an increased incidence of Legionella infection in the latter half of the 20th century. It should be emphasized that accidental human infection is a dead end for Legionella replication, and person-to-person transmission has never been reported. Therefore, the evolution of virulence traits in L. pneumophila has resulted largely from the organism's need to replicate in an intracellular niche and also avoid predation by environmental protozoa."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can L. pneumophila cause?","id":"169-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia","answer_start":264,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Although L. pneumophila is an environmental organism, its innate ability to replicate inside eukaryotic cells and its capacity to inadvertently avoid regular pathogen control mechanisms in the host have led to its emergence as an important yet accidental cause of community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The rapid advances made in the understanding of L. pneumophila molecular pathogenesis have resulted largely from the availability of genome sequences that have uncovered unusual features of the pathogen, such as the presence of virulence determinants with similarity to eukaryotic proteins. This information has been used to gain insights into the most important aspects of Legionella virulence and its potential to manipulate various aspects of eukaryotic cell biology and innate immunity. The ongoing use of genomics to provide reference sequences of more strains and serogroups of L. pneumophila and other Legionella species will no doubt continue to uncover novel virulence effectors of Legionella species and help us to understand the evolution and emergence of L. pneumophila as a major respiratory pathogen. In addition, through investigations of host-pathogen interactions, L. pneumophila has emerged as an important model for the study of innate immune responses to intracellular pathogens as well as a useful tool for investigations into eukaryotic cellular trafficking events. The ongoing study of Legionella virulence proteins and their effects on host cell biology and immunity will continue to deepen our understanding of the roles that various host cell signaling and trafficking pathways play in resistance to infection."}]}]},{"species":"Methylobacterium radiotolerans","docs":[{"title":"First report of Methylobacterium radiotolerans bacteraemia identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Methylobacterium radiotolerans is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"170-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":81,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Methylobacterium radiotolerans normally exist?","id":"170-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"various environmental sources","answer_start":127,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can M. radiotolerans cause?","id":"170-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"bacteraemia","answer_start":464,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Methylobacterium radiotolerans's requirement for oxygen?","id":"170-1-1-4","answers":[{"text":"obligate aerobic","answer_start":64,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Methylobacterium radiotolerans?","id":"170-1-1-5","answers":[{"text":"bacillus","answer_start":95,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Methylobacterium radiotolerans is a fastidious, pink-pigmented, obligate aerobic Gram-negative bacillus commonly isolated from various environmental sources, and only occasionally from clinical samples, mostly in immunocompromised patients or associated with intravascular devices and haemodialysis.

Methylobacteria are found in a wide range of environmental sources, including methane-rich environments [2], [3]. Nitrogen-fixers, they have a beneficial function in plant development, but also in toxic pollutant biodegradation [4], [5]. Occasionally, they are found in household biofilms [4]. Methylobacteria grow poorly on ordinary culture media, producing small, dry, pink-pigmented colonies after 4 or 5 days of incubation at 25\u201330\u00b0C. The best growth occurs on Sabouraud agar, but they grow also on modified Thayer\u2013Martin, buffered charcoal\u2013yeast extract and Middlebrook 7H11 agars [6]. At Gram-staining they appear as pleiomorphic, vacuolated, straight to slightly curved rods, that may resist decolouration, so exhibiting a Gram-variable appearance. Methylobacteria (mainly Methylobacterium mesophilicum) have occasionally been reported in nosocomial infections, mostly in immunocompromised patients, and in association with intravascular devices [7], [8], [9], [10]. Methylobacterium radiotolerans [11] is much less known. At the time of writing, only three reports of M. radiotolerans bacteraemia have been described [12], [13], [14] (Table 1). Overview of clinical and microbiological features of Methylobacterium radiotolerans infections described until now in the literature Abbreviations: CVC, central venous catheter; F, female; M, male. Traditionally, identification of methylobacteria relies on either biochemical [6] or molecular (16S rRNA gene sequencing) [3], [15] methods, but recently matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has demonstrated high effectiveness in the identification of known and novel species of Methylobacterium [16]. There are no guidelines for antimicrobial susceptibility testing and no defined breakpoints [17], [18], but a broad resistance to \u03b2-lactams has been reported [3], [8], [19]. In this study, we present a case of bacteraemia caused by M. radiotolerans identified by MALDI-TOF MS directly from the positive blood-culture bottles. The strain was further identified as M. radiotolerans from the plate subculture, and the species identification was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The strain was isolated from an individual affected by end-stage renal failure who chronically developed a mild fever while undergoing haemodialysis. The bacteraemia was confirmed by three consecutive blood-culture samplings in a 2-week time-frame. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of an initial identification of a Methylobacterium strain by MALDI-TOF MS from a clinical sample."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of drugs are M. radiotolerans sensitive to?","id":"170-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"gentamycin","answer_start":1368,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Methylobacterium radiotolerans is an environmental species [2], [3], only very occasionally isolated from clinical samples [7], [8], [9], [10]. Due to its poor or even absent growth on all conventional media at 35 \u00b1 2\u00b0C, cultivation requires peculiar adjustments deviating from standard routine workflow. Traditionally, laboratory methods for species identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing are challenging, laborious and slow [6]. In this study, we present the first case of an initial identification at species level of M. radiotolerans by MALDI-TOF MS (an identification by this technology was attempted in the paper by Li et al. [14], in which two out of the four strains investigated, initially identified by molecular methods, were subsequently identified by the Vitek MS instrument from the colony as \u2018unvalidated\u2019 results, while two were not identified). The species identification was first obtained directly from the positive blood-culture bottle, after a quick extraction of the bacterial cells from the blood culture by a commercially available system, and later from the plate subcultures. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed following the criteria defined for Pseudomonas adjusted to the growth requirements of methylobacteria, as no specific guidelines are currently available. The M. radiotolerans strain was susceptible to gentamycin (in discordance with the previous Italian outbreak [12]), and it showed a broad reduced susceptibility to \u03b2-lactam agents (cephalosporins, meropenem, aztreonam), and resistance to trimethoprim\/sulphamethoxazole, both consistent with the existing literature [3], [8], [12], [19]. MALDI-TOF MS represents a reliable and rapid routine identification method for methylobacteria at species level [16], that can be applied directly on the positive blood-culture flasks. In this study, the identification at species level of M. radiotolerans from the plate subculture by MALDI-TOF MS enabled at least 3 full days to be saved for the time to report, in comparison with biochemical methods. The prompt identification enabled by Sepsityper directly from the positive blood-culture bottles shortened the time to report a further 3 days. The adjustment of the growth conditions to set up the susceptibility testing, enabled by the prompt species identification, was crucial to achieve the determination of MIC values, as no growth was observed on Mueller\u2013Hinton agar at 37\u00b0C. The strains showed reduced susceptibility to many of the agents widely used in empirical therapy, so the early MALDI-TOF identification of M. radiotolerans enabled the prompt optimization of treatment. The possibility of achieving reliable species identification directly from the positive flask is especially relevant in cases such as the one reported in this study, when growth on solid medium is unusually slow, or even fails completely, because a correlation between a faster reporting time and a better clinical outcome for the patient has been widely reported [23], [24]. Opota et al. found that a pathogen rarely found in severe infections like bloodstream infections, Aerococcus urinae, could be more frequently detected after introduction of MALDI-TOF MS into clinical routine diagnostics [25]. It is unclear if broad-range PCR, as found in the case of Aerococcus urinae, would further increase the detection rate of M. radiotolerans infections. But the ability to detect the rare pathogen directly from blood cultures as demonstrated in our laboratory seems to be a suitable, more rapid and cost-effective alternative for microorganisms that are difficult to culture on solid media."}]}]},{"species":"Methylobacterium mesophilicum","docs":[{"title":"Methylobacterium mesophilicum infection: case report and literature review of an unusual opportunistic pathogen","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Methylobacterium mesophilicum is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"171-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-negative","answer_start":68,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Methylobacterium mesophilicum normally exist?","id":"171-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"environmental sources","answer_start":119,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Methylobacterium mesophilicum cause?","id":"171-1-1-3","answers":[{"text":"central catheter infection","answer_start":310,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Methylobacterium mesophilicum?","id":"171-1-1-4","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic infections","answer_start":191,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are M. mesophilicum sensitive to?","id":"171-1-1-5","answers":[{"text":"aminoglycosides and quinolones","answer_start":509,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are M. mesophilicum resistant to?","id":"171-1-1-6","answers":[{"text":"beta-lactam agents","answer_start":458,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Methylobacterium mesophilicum?","id":"171-1-1-7","answers":[{"text":"rod","answer_start":82,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Methylobacterium mesophilicum is a methylotrophic, pink pigmented, gram-negative rod that was initially isolated from environmental sources that is being increasingly reported as a cause of opportunistic infections in immunocompromised hosts.

In 1922, Alexander Fleming, discoverer of penicillin, first found M. luteus in the nasal secretion of a patient.

However, some subsets, such as M. luteus, have been proven to cause infections under certain circumstances (Fosse et al. 1985; Hirata et al. 2009; Ianniello et al. 2019). At present, it is still challenging to distinguish between M. luteus infection and contamination. Clinical judgment, positive blood culture bottles, short time to growth period (time of bacterial inoculation to detection), and new microbiologic technologies are considered possible methods to avoid blood culture contamination. In our study, all the patients had at least two consecutive positive blood culture results. They had BSI-related clinical symptoms, with a comparatively short time to growth period, and in most cases (94.8%) M. luteus was the only pathogen identified. These showed that the patients were more likely to suffer from M. luteus BSI than blood culture contamination. From 2010 to 2019, 97 patients with M. luteus BSI were included in this study, making it the study with the largest sample size to date. According to our results, M. luteus is an uncommon BSI pathogen, with incidence lower than 13 per 100,000. A favorable prognosis was expected in patients with M. luteus BSI, as most patients had low SOFA scores and survived through their hospitalization. Those who died were suffering from other severe diseases rather than M. luteus BSI (Table I), indicating that M. luteus was of low virulence. The most common features of patients with M. luteus BSI are abrupt fever, high blood NEUT%, and CRP concentration, and comparatively normal WBC count results. Immunocompromised patients, especially those who undergo invasive operations or with indwelling catheters, are more likely to suffer from M. luteus BSI, according to former research (Miltiadous and Elisaf 2011). As only a few cases of M. luteus BSI was confirmed during recent decades, the detailed antibiotic susceptibility of M. luteus remained unclear. Here we presented data of different isolates from 90 patients (%Table II and Table SI). Due to the lack of evidence of proper breakpoints for zone diameters and MICs for M. luteus, we were unlikely to judge if the isolates were susceptible or resistant to a specific antibiotic precisely. Hence, we only reported the average diameters of inhibition zones in this study. Overall, the average inhibition zone diameters of most of the antibiotics tested were large, ranging from 25 mm to 36 mm. Erythromycin, however, was found to have a smaller average diameter of inhibition zone (15 mm), which might be attributed to the existence of certain linear plasmids. In 2002 and 2010, Wolfgang Liebl and Julian R. Dib discovered two novel plasmids designated pMEC2 and pLMA1, which conferred resistance to erythromycin in M. luteus (Liebl et al. 2002; Dib et al. 2010). Hence macrolides such as erythromycin are not recommended as antimicrobial agents for M. luteus BSIs. Although most M. luteus strains were responsive to almost every antibiotic tested, some isolates were found to be less responsive to gentamycin, most cephalosporins, levofloxacin, and even carbapenems (Table SI, No. 5, 15, 51, 69, and 92). For BSI induced by these M. luteus strains, glycopeptides should be considered for antimicrobial treatment. Empirical treatment for M. luteus infection has not yet reached any consensus. In the past, patients with native valve infective endocarditis and brain abscess due to M. luteus had been treated with vancomycin, aminoglycosides, rifampin, and beta-lactam antibiotics, and all yielded good responses (Miltiadous and Elisaf 2011; Erbasan 2018; Ianniello et al. 2019; Khan et al. 2019). In FMC-PLAGH, cephalosporins and quinolones are frequently used empirically for they have a broad antibacterial spectrum and fewer adverse events. This strategy was also proven to be useful as most M. luteus strains were responsive to these antibiotics. For M. luteus strains that were less responsive to multiple antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin are proper candidates as they showed good inhibiting ability against these strains (Table SI). Nevertheless, the frequent use of glycopeptides (26.7%) in this study was considered unnecessary and should be avoided, for it might give rise to the appearance of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Instead, for most M. luteus BSIs, cephalosporins, quinolones, or other antibiotics other than macrolides will be enough for antimicrobial treatment. However, this study has several limitations. The incidence of M. luteus BSI could vary among different countries, regions, or even hospitals, giving rise to significant bias. Moreover, all the data in this study was collected retrospectively so that some details on patients\u2019 symptoms could be lost. Therefore, further researches are still needed to discover more detailed features of M. luteus BSI."}]},{"title":"Native valve infective endocarditis due to Micrococcus luteus in a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patient","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Micrococcus luteus cause?","id":"172-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"native valve infective endocarditis","answer_start":303,"id":1},{"text":"infective endocarditis","answer_start":410,"id":2},{"text":"native valve endocarditis","answer_start":607,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Micrococcus luteus sensitive to?","id":"172-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"vancomycin and rifampin","answer_start":525,"id":1},{"text":"Rifampin","answer_start":540,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Micrococcus species are typically considered contaminants from skin and mucous membranes.

Since there is such variability in clinical presentation of IE, early diagnosis is critical. The Duke Criteria is the gold standard for diagnosis of IE based on the American Heart Association (AHA) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for IE [6]. The guidelines recommend that blood cultures be drawn and an echocardiogram be performed immediately if there is a suspicion of IE. Empiric treatment is based on the suspected microorganism, native or prosthetic valve infection, and susceptibility patterns. Treatment involves monotherapy or combination of intravenous antimicrobials for a duration of up to 6 weeks. Although Micrococcus species are not typically associated with chronic infections, our patient was immunosuppressed due to active chemotherapy treatments. A potential source of infection from the port-a-cath was excluded due to negative cultures. It is possible that the Micrococcus luteus, which is considered normal oral flora, translocated into the blood during the neutropenic episode and seeded the valve. Micrococcus species are not mentioned to be a typical microorganism associated with IE according to AHA and IDSA guidelines [6]. Thus, there is no guidance on the treatment of IE due to Micrococcus luteus. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one other documented case of native valve endocarditis due to Micrococcus luteus to date [7]. Other infective endocarditis cases are documented due to Micrococcus, but of prosthetic valve infections. Micrococcus species have the ability to form biofilms with prosthetic material, which is why most cases of endocarditis are with prosthetic valves [8]. There is no defined therapeutic regimen for infective endocarditis due to Micrococcus luteus; however, based on previous reported cases and antimicrobial susceptibilities to Micrococcus species, the treatment of choice is vancomycin and rifampin [9]. This regimen was selected based on the treatment of choice for prosthetic valve endocarditis due to coagulase-negative staphylococci. Rifampin has shown to be the most active against Micrococcus species to avoid relapse of the infection, supported by in vitro susceptibility data [9]. The patient did successfully complete therapy for IE with vancomycin and rifampin with no evidence of embolic events, persistent bacteremia, or progressive valve destruction. This case is significant to note that patients that are severely immunocompromised are susceptible to life threatening infections from microorganisms that are normally considered harmless or contaminants. Clinicians should be aware for early recognition for treatment of a true infection caused by these microorganisms that could be crucial for this patient population. This case represents the challenge of managing IE in those who are immunosuppressed, as these infections can be dangerously undiagnosed. Although this patient was successfully treated with vancomycin and rifampin, further objective evidence is needed for the optimal treatment of IE caused by Micrococcus luteus."}]}]},{"species":"Mycobacterium abscessus","docs":[{"title":"Mycobacterium abscessus: It's Complex","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of M. abscessus?","id":"173-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":45,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does M. abscessus normally exist?","id":"173-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"abnormal lung airways","answer_start":87,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus) is an opportunistic pathogen usually colonizing abnormal lung airways and is often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis.

While human exposure to NTM is widespread, diseases caused by them are relatively uncommon because of the low pathogenicity of most NTM. However, due to NTM prevalence in natural and human-made environmental niches in combination with host risk factors, NTM infections are becoming an emerging global health concern in several countries. Clinical manifestations range from cutaneous infections to chronic lung disease to disseminated disease. Of the approximately 200 species of NTM identified, most infections are caused by Mycobacterium avium (M. avium) complex (MAC, comprised of several species, with the most common being M. avium, M. intracellulare, and M. chimaera, among several others), M. abscessus complex (with subspecies abscessus, subsp. massiliense, and subsp. bolletii), and M. kansasii [1]. However, depending on the region of the world, some other \u201cless common\u201d NTM species may be relatively prevalent such as M. malmoense in Northern Europe and M. xenopi in Canada and certain regions of Europe (central, southern, and the United Kingdom). Lung disease due to NTM is estimated to be increasing by approximately 8% per year in the United States in 2.3 million Medicare beneficiaries that were over 65 years of age, and in whom 58% were female subjects [2]. Other regions of the world have also noted an increase prevalence of NTM lung disease (NTM-LD). For example, NTM cases also increased from 0.9 to 2.9 per 100,000, respectively, from 1995 to 2006 in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland [3] and are also increasing in Canada [4]. The two main categories of NTM include the rapidly growing mycobacteria and the slowly growing mycobacteria. The rapid growers include the Mycobacterium chelonae-abscessus complex, including M. abscessus subsp. abscessus, M. abscessus subsp. bolletti, M. abscessus subsp. massiliense, M. chelonae, and M. fortuitum [5]. The opportunistic slow growers include the M. avium complex (MAC), with several different species including M. avium, M. intracellulare subsp. intracellulare, and subsp. chimaera, among others. As an opportunistic pathogen, M. abscessus often colonizes the lung airways in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or bronchiectasis [6], whereas humans (and mice) with normal lung airways are typically resistant to lung infection. Much more remains to be discovered about the host\u2013pathogen interactions associated with a progressive pulmonary parenchymal infection. The intrinsic drug resistance in M. abscessus has limited its therapeutic options, with only a few active antibiotics available that are effective. Severe M. abscessus lung infections are often treated with a cocktail of oral and parenteral antibiotics as well as surgical lung resection in those with localized but recalcitrant lung disease. An evaluation of the in vivo susceptibility and efficacy of these drugs against acute M. abscessus infection has been performed using both immunocompromised mice and zebrafish embryos. Imipenem-cilastatin and clarithromycin conferred protection against M. abscessus as demonstrated by restricted mycobacterial growth, decreased pathologic manifestations such as brain abscesses, and increased embryo survival [7]. However, antibiotic use has been limited due to non-standardized in vivo antibiotic susceptibility testing, limited cellular\/animal testing models, non-uniform susceptibility among different clinical isolates of M. abscessus, and incongruent clinical response, often resulting in long-term failure [8]. Worldwide, it is plausible that increased outbreaks and nosocomial transmission of M. abscessus complex are rising, reflecting an emerging antibiotic resistance crisis that threatens public health [9,10]. Further research is needed to identify optimal in vivo conditions to test the drug efficacy and optimize therapeutic regimens for M. abscessus infections."}]},{"title":"Mycobacterium abscessus Complex Infections in Humans","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Mycobacterium abscessus cause?","id":"173-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"wide spectrum of skin and soft tissue diseases, central nervous system infections, bacteremia, and ocular and other infections","answer_start":146,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are M. abscessus sensitive to?","id":"173-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"Clarithromycin, amikacin, and cefoxitin","answer_start":792,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Mycobacterium abscessus complex comprises a group of rapidly growing, multidrug-resistant, nontuberculous mycobacteria that are responsible for a wide spectrum of skin and soft tissue diseases, central nervous system infections, bacteremia, and ocular and other infections.

Over the past decade, the number of NTM disease cases worldwide has markedly increased (3,4), and the upsurge cannot be explained solely by increased awareness among physicians and advances in laboratory methods (3). M. abscessus complex is a group of rapidly growing, multidrug-resistant NTM species that are ubiquitous in soil and water (1). Species comprising M. avium complex (MAC) are the most common NTM species responsible for disease; however, infections caused by M. abscessus complex are more difficult to treat because of antimicrobial drug resistance (5).

The major difference between M. abscessus subsp. massiliense and M. abscessus subsp. abscessus is that the former does not have an intact erm(41) gene and thus does not have inducible macrolide resistance; treatment response may thus be better among patients with infections caused by M. abscessus subsp. massiliense. M. abscessus complex can cause infections involving almost all organs, but the infections generally involve the lungs, skin, and soft tissue. Drugs with the best in vitro activity include clarithromycin, amikacin, cefoxitin, and possibly tigecycline. Treatment regimens vary according to the infection site and usually include macrolide-based combination therapy, including parenteral amikacin plus another parenteral agent (cefoxitin, tigecycline, imipenem, or linezolid), for weeks to months, followed by oral antimicrobial therapy. Evidence of nosocomial transmission and outbreaks of M. abscessus complex is increasing; therefore, strenuous infection control measures should be taken to reduce the possibility of hospital-acquired M. abscessus complex infections. Because of the complexity of the molecular techniques needed to differentiate between M. abscessus subsp. abscessus and M. abscessus subsp. massiliense, it is difficult for most laboratories to identify the different subspecies. A more rapid and less expensive method for subspecies identification is thus needed for epidemiologic and clinical purposes. In addition, prospective trials comparing different regimens of antimicrobial agents are needed to determine the best treatment options; these studies should include novel agents, such as tigecycline. The effect of implementing isolation protocols for patients with infections due to M. abscessus complex (particularly pulmonary disease) should also be evaluated in future studies."}]}]},{"species":"Mycobacterium gordonae","docs":[{"title":"Mycobacterium gordonae infection in immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts: A series of seven cases and literature review","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Mycobacterium gordonae?","id":"174-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"opportunistic pathogen","answer_start":121,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Mycobacterium gordonae normally exist?","id":"174-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"ubiquitous environmental","answer_start":51,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"  Background\/purpose:  Mycobacterium gordonae is a ubiquitous environmental mycobacteria and has been long considered an opportunistic pathogen, causing infections only in immunocompromised hosts.

In 1995,  M. mucogenicum  was designated a novel species based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis [8, 10].   M. mucogenicum  is commonly isolated from municipal and hospital water supplies [6\u20138, 11]. It can form biofilms and replicate within protozoan hosts, and is resistant to standard disinfectants such as chlorine, formaldehyde, iodine and glutaraldehyde and to extreme temperatures [6, 9, 11\u201313]. The presence of this organism in tap water may contribute to the transient colonization or contamination of sputum samples but  M. mucogenicum  isolated in patients with neurological manifestation should not be considered a contaminant[14]. Catheter-related infections from  M. mucogenicum  are the most common healthcare-associated infections encountered. Contamination of the catheter during bathing was found to be the route of infection in several outbreaks [6, 11]. Our patient developed neurological and CSF biomarkers of meningitis within 1 week of placement of an EVD and responded to appropriate management.   M. mucogenicum , like other RGM, is resistant to first-line anti-tuberculosis agents (such as rifampin, rifabutin, ethambutol, isoniazid and pyrazinamide) but is sensitive to amikacin, cefoxitin, clarithromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline and minocycline [15\u201317].

The NTM are usually acquired from environmental sources such as surface water, tap water, soil, domestic and wild animals, milk, and food products. Though most species are less pathogenic or sporadic, they can, in broad terms, induce four distinct clinical syndromes [14]; 1) Progressive pulmonary disease, especially in older persons with or without underlying lung disease. 2) Superficial lymphadenitis, especially cervical lymphadenitis. 3) Disseminated disease in severely immunocompromised patients. 4) Skin and soft tissue infection usually as a consequence of direct inoculation. Recently, with the availability of 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and high-performance liquid chromatography, and polymerase chain reaction-restriction length polymorphism analysis, the number of new species of NTM including M. lentiflavum has risen dramatically [14, 15]. In fact, M. lentiflavum, one of slowly growing NTM, was first identified in a cluster of 22 isolates [1]. Among them, only one isolate from a vertebral disk in an elderly patient suffering from spondilodiscitis was clinically significant. Since then, several cases of isolates from cervical lymphadenitis of very young children have been reported [2\u20138]. Other infected sites including pulmonary infection are less frequent [1, 4, 6\u201312]. Typically, pulmonary disease by NTM is characterized as chronic progressive infectious one which develops both in healthy persons and in those with underlying pulmonary disorders or immunosuppressive conditions. The clinical features may resemble slowly progressive pulmonary tuberculosis, which is often the initial diagnosis in patients with positive results on acid fast bacilli (AFB) staining. Radiologic manifestations of pulmonary infection with NTM are various, to some degree, non-specific including the formation of solitary or multiple nodules, chronic pneumonitis, bronchiectasis, cavitary formation, or a combination of these features. Altogether, the diagnosis of pulmonary infection with NTM is extremely difficult due to several factors involved; these are various clinical and radiologic manifestations, the frequent presence of significant prior pulmonary disease, and harmless colonization of NTM in the lower respiratory tracts. According to American Thoracic Society (ATS)\/ Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines, the diagnosis should be based on specific, validated criteria that emphasize a compatible clinical syndrome, characteristic findings on chest X-ray or CT, and repeated isolation of NTM from the sputum or growth of NTM from a lung biopsy [16]. Thus, in cases with these typical radiologic findings but with negative results of routine sputum cultures for mycobacteria, physicians have been subsequently recommended to perform bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy. To our knowledge, this report is the first case of acute necrotizing pneumonia with pleurisy by M. lentiflavum in an immunocompetent patient without underlying pulmonary structural disorders. In our case, a 60-year-old man having prolonged productive cough and dyspnea with fever was initially diagnosed as pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion. Imaging studies showed that the radiologic abnormality was acute bronchopneumonic infiltration with abscess formation in the left lower lobe and parapneumonic pleural effusion. Bacteriologic examinations with sputum, pleural fluids, and bronchial washing fluids, however, revealed no definitive causative organisms. Fortunately, we could confirm that the etiologic organism was M. lentiflavum found in the cultured pleural tissues, although there is still a possibility of co-infection with other bacteria such as anaerobes because it is difficult to culture or isolate anaerobes in several respiratory samples and the patient was pre-treated with the antibiotics that would have negated bacterial cultures or have activity against co-infected bacteria. On the basis of these findings, he was diagnosed as pulmonary infection and pleurisy caused by M.

Nocardia is a well-known mimicker of several conditions of brain involvement, including primary brain tumor, metastases, and ischemic stroke [8, 23\u201325]. Nocardiosis is most commonly an opportunistic infection that causes both localized and systemic infections in the immunocompromised population. Brain involvement is rare, with N. cyriacigeorgica accounting for 2% of all brain abscesses [26]. A Nocardial brain abscess is 2.5 times more common among men [3]. The mortality rate of a Nocardia brain abscess is greater than 50%, which is three times higher than that of other bacterial causes of cerebral abscesses [10]. A Nocardial brain abscess is rare among the immunocompetent population. Publications consist solely of case reports involving one to three patients, and all of them were caused by species other than N. cyriacigeorgica, including N. farcinica, N. otitidiscaviarum, N. brasiliensis and N. abscessus [10\u201316, 27]. N. cyriacigeorgica was first isolated in 2001 by Yasin et al. from a patient with chronic bronchitis [17]. It has since been isolated from different clinical specimens and with a vast geographical distribution, including the USA, western Europe, Greece, Turkey, Japan, Thailand, and Canada [1]. A few case reports have described N. cyriacigeorgica brain abscess in immunocompromised patients [6\u20138, 17, 18, 28]. The main immunocompromised states that cause predisposition to brain abscesses are AIDS infection and diabetes mellitus [3]. Infections from N. cyriacigeorgica among immunocompetent patients are rare, and our search of the literature yielded case reports limited only to non-central nervous system infections [9]. It is well known that glucocorticoids have dose-dependent inhibitory effects on a broad range of immune system functions [19]. These inhibitory affects probably start at a low dose of glucocorticoid use [19]. However, the effects on phagocytic cell function with long-term, low-dose use are usually minimal [19]. The dose required to induce an increased risk of serious infections is a matter of controversy, with some studies claiming that a low dose of corticosteroids confers an increased risk while other studies argue that an increased risk occurs only with higher doses [20]. While the immunocompromising effects of the low dose prednisone were unknown in our patient, the fact that he was on long-term, low dose steroids, certainly possesses an important risk factor. Nocardia species, as an opportunistic source of infection, commonly manifest in immunocompromised hosts, specifically in patients with conditions that impair T cell-mediated immunity [21]. These patients commonly receive prolonged regimens of glucocorticoids in addition to other immunosuppressant drugs or have other underlying immunosuppressive conditions [19]. The clinical course of Nocardiosis can be misleading, which was reflected in the current case whose presentation was initially thought to be an ischemic stroke and later determined as being a cerebral lesion. It can sometimes be difficult to recognize the source of symptoms as being an abscess at presentation, and a high clinical suspicion is needed. Frequent skin injuries incurred during gardening were a likely source of Nocardia inoculation, and, in retrospect, together with his long-term prednisone consumption history, were an important diagnostic clue in our patient. In conclusion, Nocardia species are rare causes of brain abscess in immunocompetent patients. Their clinical presentation can mimic other, more common cerebral diseases. We report a case of a brain abscess caused by N. cyriacigeorgica in an immunocompetent patient that was thought to be an ischemic stroke at presentation and a space-occupying lesion later on. We believe that frequent skin injuries during gardening were a likely source of his Nocardia inoculation."}]},{"title":"Nocardia cyriacigeorgica septicemia","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Nocardia cyriacigeorgica cause?","id":"179-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"septicemia and disseminated infection","answer_start":48,"id":1},{"text":"bloodstream infection","answer_start":312,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"We report two cases of Nocardia cyriacigeorgica septicemia and disseminated infection in the setting of profound immunodeficiency.

She denied any fever, chills, cough, or weight loss. Baseline laboratory studies revealed neutrophilia, lymphocytosis, anemia, and hyponatremia. Radiologic studies demonstrated patchy and nodular infiltrates in the right lung, bilateral pleural effusions, multiple ring enhancing lesions in the cerebellum and cerebrum, and a right adrenal mass. Upon the patient's admission to hospital, three sets of BacT\/Alert FAN (bioMerieux Inc., Durham, N.C.) aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures were collected, while the adrenal mass was biopsied to rule out infectious and noninfectious etiologies. After 2.5 days of incubation, the aerobic bottle of one of the blood culture sets demonstrated the presence of a partially acid fast, branching, rod-shaped bacterium that formed dry white colonies after overnight growth on 5% sheep blood and Sabouraud dextrose agar media. Respiratory samples were not collected for microbiological analysis. A diagnosis of disseminated nocardiosis was subsequently made, after which the patient received empirical therapy with intravenous meropenem (1 g every 8 h) and oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (160 and 800 mg, respectively, twice daily). Using Microseq 500 kits and an ABI Prism 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), partial sequencing (first 500 bp) of the 16S rRNA gene of the blood culture was successful. A BLAST search (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/BLAST\/) of the GenBank database revealed 100% homology of our patient's sequence with that of five strains of Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (GenBank accession numbers {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AB094578\",\"term_id\":\"41386614\"}}AB094578, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AB115955\",\"term_id\":\"41386661\"}}AB115955, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AY244782\",\"term_id\":\"29653062\"}}AY244782, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AY262326\",\"term_id\":\"37790723\"}}AY262326, and {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AB094580\",\"term_id\":\"41386616\"}}AB094580) and 98.1% and 97.9% homology with two other N. cyriacigeorgica strains (GenBank accession numbers {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AF430027\",\"term_id\":\"28933359\"}}AF430027 and {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AF282889\",\"term_id\":\"11640823\"}}AF282889, respectively). The adrenal biopsy culture was also positive for N. cyriacigeorgica. The isolate was susceptible to TMP-SMX (MICs, \u22642\/38 \u03bcg\/ml), imipenem (MIC, 2 \u03bcg\/ml), and amikacin (MIC, \u226416 \u03bcg\/ml) based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI; formerly NCCLS) broth microdilution susceptibility testing (13). The patient's clinical condition gradually improved over the course of her stay in the hospital, but she remained on intravenous meropenem and oral TMP-SMX for several weeks thereafter through the regional home intravenous therapy program. Follow-up radiologic investigations 2 months post-hospital discharge demonstrated complete resolution of the pulmonary abnormalities, persistent but significantly resolved cerebral and cerebellar lesions, and decreased size of the right adrenal mass. Sequelae included mild to moderate speech impairment and generalized weakness.  The patient was a 47-year-old woman with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who eventually underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant. She presented to hospital \u201cB\u201d (approximately 7 months prior to the presentation of the case 1 patient) 6 months posttransplantation, with a 2-week history of a productive cough and dyspnea. A chest X ray revealed a right lower lobe infiltrate, after which she was admitted with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. She was treated with intravenous levofloxacin but without clinical improvement; her dyspnea worsened, and she later developed hemoptysis. A computed tomography scan of the chest was performed, which demonstrated a cavity in the right lower lung lobe. Bacterial, fungal, and other etiologies were considered in the differential diagnosis of her pulmonary process, and her antibiotic therapy was later modified to include levofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and amphotericin B. Bronchoscopy was subsequently performed to rule out these considerations, although Gram staining and culture of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens did not reveal the presence of any microbial pathogen. Two sets of BacT\/Alert FAN (bioMerieux Inc., Durham, N.C.) aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures were collected shortly upon admission to hospital. After 3.5 days of incubation, the aerobic bottle from one of the blood culture sets was positive for a partially acid fast, branching, gram-positive rod-shaped bacterium, which grew very well as a dry white colony on 5% sheep blood and Sabouraud dextrose agar media. A diagnosis of disseminated nocardiosis was subsequently made, after which the patient received empirical therapy with intravenous meropenem (1 g every 8 h for 1 week) followed by TMP-SMX (70 and 350 mg, respectively, given intravenously every 8 h for 2 weeks, followed by 160 and 800 mg given orally twice daily thereafter). Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of the blood culture isolate was successful, resulting in the identification of the organism as Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, with a sequence and an antimicrobial susceptibility profile identical to those of the case 1 isolate. Almost 2 months later (while on oral TMP-SMX), the patient developed Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia, for which intravenous ceftriaxone was started. She also suffered from graft-versus-host disease, which required tapering of her immunosuppressive (100 mg of cyclosporine twice daily and 50 mg of prednisone once daily) medications. However, she developed new pulmonary nodules and underwent a repeat bronchoscopy that revealed an Aspergillus sp. from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cultures. The Aspergillus sp. was treated with amphotericin B, but the patient's clinical condition gradually deteriorated despite all efforts, and she died 5 months after admission. An autopsy revealed the presence of central nervous system and pulmonary aspergillosis without evidence of disseminated nocardiosis, although autopsy tissue specimens for microbiological culture were not submitted. The genus Nocardia comprises a group of obligately aerobic, weakly gram positive, partially acid fast, branching, often beaded, filamentous bacteria that typically fragment into nonmotile rod- or coccoid-shaped elements (4). The name of the genus originated from the work of Edmond Nocard, who in 1888 reported the isolation of an aerobic actinomycete from cattle with bovine pleuropneumonia (16), although Eppinger reported the first case of human Nocardia infection 2 years later (16). At least 44 species of Nocardia are officially recognized to date, of which 24 are considered to be of medical importance, while an additional 4 newly proposed species (all of medical importance) are being considered for taxonomic inclusion in the genus (4, 7). Nocardiae are found ubiquitously in the environment worldwide, including various soil, freshwater, marine-water, and organic-matter habitats, where they are believed to maintain a saprophytic existence (3, 4, 12). Nocardia species may also be present in domestic environments such as house dust, garden soil, beach sand, and swimming pools (12). Occasionally, they may be found as transient colonizers of the skin and upper respiratory tract (12). Human infections caused by this group of organisms typically involve the lungs or skin and occur via inhalation of contaminated airborne dust particles or cutaneously via traumatic implantation, respectively (3, 4, 12, 16). About 1,000 cases of infection are estimated to occur annually in the United States (11). Pulmonary nocardiosis, the most common form of human nocardial infection in developed countries, is an acute, subacute, or chronic necrotizing suppurative infection usually caused by members of the Nocardia asteroides complex (11, 12, 16). Cutaneous nocardiosis typically presents as a mycetoma or a sporotrichoid infection, is more common in the tropics and subtropics, including Central and South America and the deep southern United States, and is usually caused by Nocardia brasiliensis but may also be caused by other Nocardia species (4, 11, 12, 16). Hematogenous dissemination to the central nervous system, bone, joint, eyes, kidney, spleen, liver, thyroid, adrenal, heart, and\/or prostate may occur (4, 10-12, 16), although central nervous system infection without apparent lung or skin involvement has commonly been reported (2, 16). While nocardial infections may occur in individuals with intact immune systems, disease (particularly disseminated infection) is more commonly seen in patients with marked immunodeficiency such as those with bone marrow or solid-organ transplants, lymphoreticular malignancy, or AIDS or in the setting of chronic corticosteroid therapy (3, 4, 6, 10-12, 16). Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (formerly named Nocardia cyriacigeorgici) was first described by Yassin and colleagues in 2001 (1, 19). These researchers recovered, from the bronchial secretions of a patient with chronic bronchitis, a Nocardia sp. that did not belong to any previously described members of this genus based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data and biochemical characteristics (19). Other reports of the recovery of N. cyriacigeorgica from human clinical specimens have subsequently been documented (2, 8, 9, 14, 18). In several cases, N. cyriacigeorgica was identified in retrospect by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of previously biochemically identified presumptive N. asteroides clinical isolates from pulmonary and cutaneous sources (9, 14, 15), although N. cyriacigeorgica is easily distinguished from other Nocardia species by the results of a few phenotypic tests (15). Based on detailed 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and limited phenotypic data, it appears that N. cyriacigeorgica is identical to N. asteroides drug susceptibility pattern type VI (14, 15, 17), which appears to account for approximately 60% of the clinical N. asteroides complex strains recovered from patients in the United States (14). Hence, it is likely that many clinical isolates previously generically classified as N. asteroides would have had the type VI drug susceptibility pattern and therefore would be considered identical to N. cyriacigeorgica. The first confirmed case of invasive human infection caused by N. cyriacigeorgica was reported for an immunocompromised patient with central nervous system nocardiosis where the diagnosis was made by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the bacterium from brain abscess material (8). While the likelihood exists that strains of N. asteroides with drug susceptibility pattern type VI have been recovered from human blood, no detailed reports to date have specifically described the recovery of N. cyriacigeorgica from this source based on DNA sequence-based identification. Even though disseminated nocardiosis is presumed to occur via hematogenous spread from pulmonary or cutaneous sites, Nocardia bacteremia is unusual (10). In a recent review of bacteremic Nocardia infections, N. asteroides was found to be the predominant pathogen, while bacteremic disease due to Nocardia nova, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum, and Nocardia farcinica was less commonly encountered (10). The mortality rate among patients with Nocardia bacteremia is about 50% (10). Occasionally, the recovery of Nocardia species from blood cultures may represent contamination, depending on the clinical setting (10). Since our case 2 patient had no evidence of disseminated nocardiosis upon autopsy, the possibility exists that this may not represent a true case of bacteremia. Successful therapy of Nocardia infections requires the prolonged (usually for months) use of effective antimicrobial agents, often in association with appropriate surgical measures. In vitro susceptibility testing methods for the genus Nocardia have only recently been standardized (13). However, most Nocardia species appear to be susceptible to TMP-SMX, carbapenems, and amikacin (4, 16). Limited information regarding the susceptibility profile of N. cyriacigeorgica clinical isolates is available (8, 15), although it appears that most isolates would be susceptible to the above agents based on their previous designation as N. asteroides. Both of our N. cyriacigeorgica strains demonstrated in vitro susceptibility to TMP-SMX, imipenem, and amikacin.

She denied any fever, chills, cough, or weight loss. Baseline laboratory studies revealed neutrophilia, lymphocytosis, anemia, and hyponatremia. Radiologic studies demonstrated patchy and nodular infiltrates in the right lung, bilateral pleural effusions, multiple ring enhancing lesions in the cerebellum and cerebrum, and a right adrenal mass. Upon the patient's admission to hospital, three sets of BacT\/Alert FAN (bioMerieux Inc., Durham, N.C.) aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures were collected, while the adrenal mass was biopsied to rule out infectious and noninfectious etiologies. After 2.5 days of incubation, the aerobic bottle of one of the blood culture sets demonstrated the presence of a partially acid fast, branching, rod-shaped bacterium that formed dry white colonies after overnight growth on 5% sheep blood and Sabouraud dextrose agar media. Respiratory samples were not collected for microbiological analysis. A diagnosis of disseminated nocardiosis was subsequently made, after which the patient received empirical therapy with intravenous meropenem (1 g every 8 h) and oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (160 and 800 mg, respectively, twice daily). Using Microseq 500 kits and an ABI Prism 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), partial sequencing (first 500 bp) of the 16S rRNA gene of the blood culture was successful. A BLAST search (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/BLAST\/) of the GenBank database revealed 100% homology of our patient's sequence with that of five strains of Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (GenBank accession numbers {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AB094578\",\"term_id\":\"41386614\"}}AB094578, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AB115955\",\"term_id\":\"41386661\"}}AB115955, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AY244782\",\"term_id\":\"29653062\"}}AY244782, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AY262326\",\"term_id\":\"37790723\"}}AY262326, and {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AB094580\",\"term_id\":\"41386616\"}}AB094580) and 98.1% and 97.9% homology with two other N. cyriacigeorgica strains (GenBank accession numbers {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AF430027\",\"term_id\":\"28933359\"}}AF430027 and {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AF282889\",\"term_id\":\"11640823\"}}AF282889, respectively). The adrenal biopsy culture was also positive for N. cyriacigeorgica. The isolate was susceptible to TMP-SMX (MICs, \u22642\/38 \u03bcg\/ml), imipenem (MIC, 2 \u03bcg\/ml), and amikacin (MIC, \u226416 \u03bcg\/ml) based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI; formerly NCCLS) broth microdilution susceptibility testing (13). The patient's clinical condition gradually improved over the course of her stay in the hospital, but she remained on intravenous meropenem and oral TMP-SMX for several weeks thereafter through the regional home intravenous therapy program. Follow-up radiologic investigations 2 months post-hospital discharge demonstrated complete resolution of the pulmonary abnormalities, persistent but significantly resolved cerebral and cerebellar lesions, and decreased size of the right adrenal mass. Sequelae included mild to moderate speech impairment and generalized weakness.  The patient was a 47-year-old woman with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who eventually underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant. She presented to hospital \u201cB\u201d (approximately 7 months prior to the presentation of the case 1 patient) 6 months posttransplantation, with a 2-week history of a productive cough and dyspnea. A chest X ray revealed a right lower lobe infiltrate, after which she was admitted with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. She was treated with intravenous levofloxacin but without clinical improvement; her dyspnea worsened, and she later developed hemoptysis. A computed tomography scan of the chest was performed, which demonstrated a cavity in the right lower lung lobe. Bacterial, fungal, and other etiologies were considered in the differential diagnosis of her pulmonary process, and her antibiotic therapy was later modified to include levofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and amphotericin B. Bronchoscopy was subsequently performed to rule out these considerations, although Gram staining and culture of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens did not reveal the presence of any microbial pathogen. Two sets of BacT\/Alert FAN (bioMerieux Inc., Durham, N.C.) aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures were collected shortly upon admission to hospital. After 3.5 days of incubation, the aerobic bottle from one of the blood culture sets was positive for a partially acid fast, branching, gram-positive rod-shaped bacterium, which grew very well as a dry white colony on 5% sheep blood and Sabouraud dextrose agar media. A diagnosis of disseminated nocardiosis was subsequently made, after which the patient received empirical therapy with intravenous meropenem (1 g every 8 h for 1 week) followed by TMP-SMX (70 and 350 mg, respectively, given intravenously every 8 h for 2 weeks, followed by 160 and 800 mg given orally twice daily thereafter). Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of the blood culture isolate was successful, resulting in the identification of the organism as Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, with a sequence and an antimicrobial susceptibility profile identical to those of the case 1 isolate. Almost 2 months later (while on oral TMP-SMX), the patient developed Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia, for which intravenous ceftriaxone was started. She also suffered from graft-versus-host disease, which required tapering of her immunosuppressive (100 mg of cyclosporine twice daily and 50 mg of prednisone once daily) medications. However, she developed new pulmonary nodules and underwent a repeat bronchoscopy that revealed an Aspergillus sp. from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cultures. The Aspergillus sp. was treated with amphotericin B, but the patient's clinical condition gradually deteriorated despite all efforts, and she died 5 months after admission. An autopsy revealed the presence of central nervous system and pulmonary aspergillosis without evidence of disseminated nocardiosis, although autopsy tissue specimens for microbiological culture were not submitted. The genus Nocardia comprises a group of obligately aerobic, weakly gram positive, partially acid fast, branching, often beaded, filamentous bacteria that typically fragment into nonmotile rod- or coccoid-shaped elements (4). The name of the genus originated from the work of Edmond Nocard, who in 1888 reported the isolation of an aerobic actinomycete from cattle with bovine pleuropneumonia (16), although Eppinger reported the first case of human Nocardia infection 2 years later (16). At least 44 species of Nocardia are officially recognized to date, of which 24 are considered to be of medical importance, while an additional 4 newly proposed species (all of medical importance) are being considered for taxonomic inclusion in the genus (4, 7). Nocardiae are found ubiquitously in the environment worldwide, including various soil, freshwater, marine-water, and organic-matter habitats, where they are believed to maintain a saprophytic existence (3, 4, 12). Nocardia species may also be present in domestic environments such as house dust, garden soil, beach sand, and swimming pools (12). Occasionally, they may be found as transient colonizers of the skin and upper respiratory tract (12). Human infections caused by this group of organisms typically involve the lungs or skin and occur via inhalation of contaminated airborne dust particles or cutaneously via traumatic implantation, respectively (3, 4, 12, 16). About 1,000 cases of infection are estimated to occur annually in the United States (11). Pulmonary nocardiosis, the most common form of human nocardial infection in developed countries, is an acute, subacute, or chronic necrotizing suppurative infection usually caused by members of the Nocardia asteroides complex (11, 12, 16). Cutaneous nocardiosis typically presents as a mycetoma or a sporotrichoid infection, is more common in the tropics and subtropics, including Central and South America and the deep southern United States, and is usually caused by Nocardia brasiliensis but may also be caused by other Nocardia species (4, 11, 12, 16). Hematogenous dissemination to the central nervous system, bone, joint, eyes, kidney, spleen, liver, thyroid, adrenal, heart, and\/or prostate may occur (4, 10-12, 16), although central nervous system infection without apparent lung or skin involvement has commonly been reported (2, 16). While nocardial infections may occur in individuals with intact immune systems, disease (particularly disseminated infection) is more commonly seen in patients with marked immunodeficiency such as those with bone marrow or solid-organ transplants, lymphoreticular malignancy, or AIDS or in the setting of chronic corticosteroid therapy (3, 4, 6, 10-12, 16). Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (formerly named Nocardia cyriacigeorgici) was first described by Yassin and colleagues in 2001 (1, 19). These researchers recovered, from the bronchial secretions of a patient with chronic bronchitis, a Nocardia sp. that did not belong to any previously described members of this genus based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data and biochemical characteristics (19). Other reports of the recovery of N. cyriacigeorgica from human clinical specimens have subsequently been documented (2, 8, 9, 14, 18). In several cases, N. cyriacigeorgica was identified in retrospect by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of previously biochemically identified presumptive N. asteroides clinical isolates from pulmonary and cutaneous sources (9, 14, 15), although N. cyriacigeorgica is easily distinguished from other Nocardia species by the results of a few phenotypic tests (15). Based on detailed 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and limited phenotypic data, it appears that N. cyriacigeorgica is identical to N. asteroides drug susceptibility pattern type VI (14, 15, 17), which appears to account for approximately 60% of the clinical N. asteroides complex strains recovered from patients in the United States (14). Hence, it is likely that many clinical isolates previously generically classified as N. asteroides would have had the type VI drug susceptibility pattern and therefore would be considered identical to N. cyriacigeorgica. The first confirmed case of invasive human infection caused by N. cyriacigeorgica was reported for an immunocompromised patient with central nervous system nocardiosis where the diagnosis was made by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the bacterium from brain abscess material (8). While the likelihood exists that strains of N. asteroides with drug susceptibility pattern type VI have been recovered from human blood, no detailed reports to date have specifically described the recovery of N. cyriacigeorgica from this source based on DNA sequence-based identification. Even though disseminated nocardiosis is presumed to occur via hematogenous spread from pulmonary or cutaneous sites, Nocardia bacteremia is unusual (10). In a recent review of bacteremic Nocardia infections, N. asteroides was found to be the predominant pathogen, while bacteremic disease due to Nocardia nova, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum, and Nocardia farcinica was less commonly encountered (10). The mortality rate among patients with Nocardia bacteremia is about 50% (10). Occasionally, the recovery of Nocardia species from blood cultures may represent contamination, depending on the clinical setting (10). Since our case 2 patient had no evidence of disseminated nocardiosis upon autopsy, the possibility exists that this may not represent a true case of bacteremia. Successful therapy of Nocardia infections requires the prolonged (usually for months) use of effective antimicrobial agents, often in association with appropriate surgical measures. In vitro susceptibility testing methods for the genus Nocardia have only recently been standardized (13). However, most Nocardia species appear to be susceptible to TMP-SMX, carbapenems, and amikacin (4, 16). Limited information regarding the susceptibility profile of N. cyriacigeorgica clinical isolates is available (8, 15), although it appears that most isolates would be susceptible to the above agents based on their previous designation as N. asteroides. Both of our N. cyriacigeorgica strains demonstrated in vitro susceptibility to TMP-SMX, imipenem, and amikacin. Linezolid appears to be the most effective agent against Nocardia species based on in vitro data, although experience with this drug in the treatment of Nocardia infections is limited (4, 5). In summary, N. cyriacigeorgica represents a distinct lineage within the genus Nocardia that is now believed to be identical to formerly uncategorized strains within this genus. Molecular methods such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing have demonstrated the propensity of N. cyriacigeorgica to cause bacteremic disease in humans, particularly in individuals with compromised immune systems."}]}]},{"species":"Nocardia abscessus","docs":[{"title":"Nocardia abscessus brain abscess in an immunocompetent host","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Nocardia abscessus cause?","id":"180-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"brain abscess","answer_start":225,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are Nocardia abscessus sensitive to?","id":"180-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"linezolid, clarithromycin, ceftriaxone, imipenem, tobramycin, amikacin, minocycline and sulfamethoxazole","answer_start":323,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Nocardia brain abscesses typically occur in immunocompromised patients.

CT has the maximum sensitivity for early detection of bone involvement, while MRI is the most comprehensive method for assessment of bone and soft tissue involvement.[6] The bony lesions also provide an objective assessment for monitoring response to treatment, hence need to be repeated 6 monthly. N. africana\/nova identified as the aetiological agent in our case is a rare organism causing mycetoma. Species identification of Nocardia is done by a combination of antibiotic susceptibility patterns, molecular methods like gene sequencing of 16SrRNA and hsp65PRA patterns and Matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). MALDI-TOF MS has accurate species-level identification in 94\u201395.9% in Nocardia isolates[9,10] and 97.9% in N. africana. Previously, N. africana has been reported in few select case reports to cause cauliflower-like verrucous plaque resembling squamous cell carcinoma,[11] fulminant disseminated nocardiosis leading to death in a 12-year-old immunocompetent boy,[12] feline mycetoma,[13] bovine mastitis,[14] and feline mandibular osteomyelitis.[15] Nocardiosis has been recorded to be transmitted from bites and scratches of seemingly asymptomatic animals like cats.[1] In our case, the patient had a history of feeding many stray cats who visited her house and may have acquired infection through them. Identification of subspecies of Nocardia is important as it adds to the epidemiology and geographical distribution; helps to correlate species to a particular clinical presentation and deciding the antibiotics for successful treatment. It is known that common cause of cutaneous nocardiosis, N. brasiliensis is susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid whereas N. nova\/africana which was the causative organism in our case is susceptible to ampicillin but resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Hence, it should be attempted to narrow down speciation to the complex such as N. nova complex. In conclusion, N. africana\/nova is a rare organism causing actinomycetoma. NCCT or MRI is better for evaluating bone involvement.

Similarities of \u226599.0 % were deemed to denote the same species. In terms of 16S, the bacterium was most similar (99.0 %) to Nocardia nova IFM 0272. Similarity with N. nova DSM 44481 and DSM 43207 [5] was lower at 98.7 %. Ninety-eight percent similarity was detected with the sequences for Nocardia africana, Nocardia aobensis, Nocardia cerradoensis, Nocardia kruczakiae and Nocardia veterana. The hsp65 gene showed 99 % similarity with respect to those of N. aobensis DSM 44805, N. nova DSM 44481, N. veterana NRRL B-24136 and N. kruczakiae DSM 44877 [5].

Ocular inflammation resolved after 2 months with specific treatment. Two months after retinal surgery, the patient underwent iris reconstruction, secondary IOL fixation and Ahmed valve implantation. VA improved to 0.2. Three years after treatment discontinuation, no inflammation was observed. Ocular infections caused by Nocardia species previously unknown in immunocompetent patients have recently been reported [6, 7]. The cornea and anterior chamber of the eye are immune-privileged tissues; this may explain the appearance of ocular infections or surgically related endophthalmitis in such patients [6, 8]. This report describes an immunocompetent child who suffered ocular trauma by a palm tree leaflet inoculating N. kruczakiae. Nocardial infection should be considered in patients with such plant-inflicted trauma since 31\u201367 % of postoperative nocardial endophthalmitis have occurred in those living in rural areas [6, 9]. Initial management with rounds of corticosteroids probably encouraged chronic infection. Long corticosteroid treatment predisposes patients to nocardial endophthalmitis [9]. A large proportion of patients (75\u201383 %) show nodules on the corneal endothelium or on the iris; however, the posterior segment is usually normal or only slightly involved [6, 9]. Surgical procedures are frequently used to eradicate nocardial endophthalmitis. The outcome of nocardial endophthalmitis can be poor due to its delayed presentation and extensive involvement of the anterior chamber. The present patient showed an improvement to a VA of 0.2 OS from 0.1, despite late diagnosis and the retinal detachment that occurred after IOL removal. N. kruczakiae is difficult to distinguish from N. africana, N. nova and N. veterana by phenotyping [2] but can be identified by molecular technique even when the samples available are very small and patients have undergone treatment with antibiotics [7, 10]. 16S analysis commonly provides a definitive identification, but certain closely related species cannot be differentiated, a consequence of the low level of interspecies polymorphism and the existence of multiple and different copies of 16S in N. nova [11, 2]. Indeed, several species, such as N. africana, N. aobensis, N. cerradoensis, N. nova, N. kruczakiae and N. veterana, cluster together even when examined by multilocus sequence typing [5]. The rpoB and gyrB genes are known to show greater diversity than 16S and hsp65 and therefore allow for more precise identification [5].

N. kruczakiae CNM997\/10 also showed the same susceptibility profile to that first described for N. kruczakiae ATCC BAA-280 [2], except for ampicillin (Table 1). Treatment with amikacin, clarithromycin, imipenem, linezolid and trimethoprim\/sulphamethoxazole would therefore appear appropriate.

Ophthalmic drops included brimonidine 0.15% three times daily, and prednisolone acetate 1% (Pred Forte, Allergan, Inc., Irvine, USA) once daily in the left eye. Ophthalmic examination showed visual acuities of counting fingers at 2 feet in the right eye and 20\/20 in the left eye. His pupils were briskly reactive without an afferent pupillary defect. The intraocular pressures were 12 mmHg OD and 13 mmHg OS. Slit lamp examination of the right eye revealed trace conjunctival injection with 2 to 3+ anterior chamber and vitreous cell. Slit lamp examination of the left eye was unremarkable. Fundus examination of the right eye showed 2+ vitreous haze with a poorly visualized white retinal and subretinal lesion in the superior periphery with overlying punctate hemorrhages (Figure 1). Fundus examination of the left eye showed a chorioretinal scar superotemporally corresponding to the area of prior CMV retinitis. There was no vitreous haze or active retinitis, and a ganciclovir implant was well-positioned inferotemporally. Photograph and B-scan ultrasound of the left eye.

Aqueous PCR testing for Varicella zoster virus (VZV), CMV, Herpes simplex virus (HSV), and Toxoplasma gondii DNA were negative. Bacterial and fungal blood cultures showed no growth, and T. gondii IgG and IgM were negative. Valganciclovir therapy was deferred because of baseline neutropenia. Prednisolone acetate 1% every 2 h and atropine sulfate 1% were initiated with some improvement of the patient's photophobia. One week later, the patient's visual acuity decreased to hand motions. The patient continued to have 2+ anterior chamber cell and 3+ vitreous haze, and the area of the retinal and subretinal whitening had expanded (Figure 2). Intravitreal injections of vancomycin (1 mg\/0.1 cc), ceftazidime (2.25 mg\/0.1 cc), and voriconazole (400 mcg\/0.1 cc) were administered. Vitreous cultures were sent for gram and fungal stains, as well as bacterial and fungal cultures. Aqueous fluid was sent for eubacterial PCR, eufungal PCR, and Aspergillus PCR, given the patient's recent history of Aspergillus pneumonia. All tests were negative. Repeat B-scan ultrasound and pathologic evaluation. (A) Repeat B-scan ultrasound 1 week following initial presentation confirmed enlargement of the lesion measuring 2.6 mm in height and 9.7 \u00d7 10.3 mm in basal diameter. (B) Pathologic evaluation of the subretinal aspirate and vitreous specimen showed a cluster of gram-positive filamentous organisms consistent with Nocardia species (Brown and Brenn method, \u00d7100). The patient subsequently underwent diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy and a retinal biopsy, given the enlargement of the subretinal mass and unknown etiology. During the vitrectomy, a few retinal holes were observed in the region of the subretinal mass. These holes were used to aspirate the subretinal material. The vitreous specimen, subretinal aspirate, and retinal biopsy were sent for pathologic evaluation. Air-fluid exchange, endolaser, and 14% C3F8 gas tamponade were performed, and intravitreal ceftazidime (2.25 mg\/0.1 cc) and vancomycin (1 mg\/0.1 cc) were administered. Specimens were sent for flow cytometry; PCR testing for VZV, HSV, CMV, and toxoplasmosis; and for gram stain, AFB stain, aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal cultures. Pathologic evaluation of the subretinal aspirate and vitreous specimen showed gram-positive filamentous bacteria consistent with Nocardia or Actinomyces. Cultures continued to show no growth, and the samples were sent to the molecular diagnostics laboratory of the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, Georgia, USA) for 16S ribosomal RNA analysis. The vitreous fluid culture eventually grew N. veterana identified using PCR. The specimen was sensitive to amikacin, clarithromycin, linezolid, and trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole with intermediate sensitivity to ceftriaxone and imipenem. The patient was admitted to the hospital for intravenous (IV) meropenem (2 g loading, followed by 1 g IV every 12 h adjusted for creatinine clearance of 29 mL\/min) and linezolid (600 mg IV every 12 h). Aztihromycin 500 mg daily was substituted for linezolid after 6 weeks because of thrombocytopenia. In addition, meropenem was discontinued after 6 weeks and switched to ceftriaxone 2 grams IV every 12 h for more reliable central nervous system penetration. Both azithromycin and ceftriaxone were continued with a plan to continue the medications for 12 months. Magnetic resonance imaging showed no evidence of brain involvement. On ophthalmic exam, the retinal biopsy site was flat, and the subretinal infiltrates appeared stable. In conjunction with systemic antibiotics, intravitreal amikacin (400 mcg\/0.1 cc) was administered weekly for 3 weeks with continued improvement of the retinal and subretinal lesion. Two months following vitrectomy, the patient's visual acuity declined to light perception only, and a retinal detachment was observed on B-scan ultrasound. The patient underwent vitrectomy, membrane peel, and silicone oil tamponade with successful reattachment of the retina. His visual acuity improved to counting fingers at 9 months follow-up with an attached retina and no evidence of recurrent infection. Ocular infection by Nocardia is rare and most cases are acquired exogenously from trauma or following ocular surgery. Nocardia endogenous endophthalmitis is exceedingly rare, with fewer than forty cases reported since 1967 [4]. The majority of these cases have been reported in immunocompromised patients as a result of hematogenous dissemination, most often from a primary pulmonary focus. Associated causes of immunosuppression in these individuals have included untreated HIV infection, organ transplantation, systemic lupus erythematosus, cancer, and steroid use [3]. Our case was unique in that N. veterana has not been previously reported to cause endophthalmitis. N. veterana was first isolated in 2001 from a veteran soldier in Australia with bilateral upper lobe pneumonia, giving rise to its veterana nomenclature and bears 16S rDNA similarities to N. vaccinii[1]. Notably, several cases of N. veterana lung infection have also been associated with concurrent aspergillus, CMV, or Pneumocystis jiroveci infection [3,5-7], likely as a result of severe immunosuppressed status of the host. Our patient presented with a history of CMV retinitis and Aspergillus pneumonia, which preceded the development of N. veterana endophthalmitis. A decrease in the immunosuppressive medications and concomitant anti-microbial therapy eventually led to eradication of the intraocular infection. Although the patient's visual acuity was poor at final follow-up, the retina remained attached and the globe was salvaged in this case. Prior studies have estimated that 0.6% to 1% of patients with systemic nocardiosis will develop endogenous endophthalmitis [4]. Only two isolated infections have been reported in the absence of systemic infection. The diagnosis is often difficult to establish because of its slow growth on culture media and lack of definitive clinical findings. Moreover, diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for ocular infection have not been established and are frequently associated with poor visual and anatomic outcomes [1]. In a review of 38 patients with endogenous Nocardia endophthalmitis reported over a 40-year period, the majority of patients had underlying systemic illness resulting in immunosuppression; specifically, 46% of those affected were transplant recipients, 24% had autoimmune disease, and 19% had hematologic malignancy. In those cases of endophthalmitis associated with transplantation, nocardial infection occurred within the first year of transplantation in 11 of 17 cases. Corticosteroids were the most common immunosuppressive therapy used by 73% alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive medications [4]. Our patient's nocardial endophthalmitis occurred 18 months after transplantation while on combination immunosuppression with prednisone 20 mg\/day, mycophenolic acid, and tacrolimus. The most typical presentation of nocardial endophthalmitis is decreased vision and eye pain. The most common examination findings are the presence of anterior chamber inflammation (37%), vitreous inflammation (37%), and a single chorioretinal lesion (69%). Diagnosis in most cases required diagnostic vitrectomy for ocular specimens (50%) with an average time to diagnosis of 3.5 weeks [4]. Retinal detachment has been reported in up to 40% of patients with nocardial endophthalmitis [4]. Our patient experienced a retinal detachment related to proliferative vitreoretinopathy, which ultimately required repeat vitrectomy, membrane peeling, and long-term silicone oil tamponade. An improvement in the nocardial infection was observed at the time of the retinal detachment repair, although long-term antibiotics are being continued to ensure disease control. The strain of N. veterana in our patient was susceptible to multiple antibiotics, and prior reports suggest that the majority of such patients may be treated successfully with trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. However, 13% of nocardial endophthalmitis patients were not effectively treated using this trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole alone [4]. For this reason, intravitreal amikacin has been reported as an alternative treatment strategy and was used in combination with systemic antimicrobials to achieve control of the nocardial infection. The systemic and visual prognosis for patients with Nocardia endogenous endophthalmitis is extremely guarded to poor in many cases, often because of delayed diagnosis and other sequelae including the high frequency of secondary complications, such as retinal detachment, that may lead to visual loss. Specifically, in one series, 32% of patients died, only 31% of patients recovered visual acuity of 20\/40 to 20\/200, and 34% of patients were 20\/200 or poorer; moreover, 31% of patients were 20\/40 or better at final follow-up [4]. In summary, this is the first report of endogenous endophthalmitis from N. veterana. Although our patient's infection was eventually controlled with antimicrobial treatment, his visual acuity was ultimately limited by the retinal detachment, likely related to the severe, advanced nature of the infection and development of proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Nocardia, while a rare cause of endophthalmitis, should be considered along with other opportunistic infections in patients with severe immunosuppression presenting with endophthalmitis.

His past medical history included a grade 4 left temporal glioblastoma, diagnosed 11 months before, and multicystic kidney disease. The patient underwent surgery and radiation therapy, followed by first line chemotherapy with temozolomide and second line chemotherapy with lomustine, vincristine, and procarbazin, due to disease progression. He was given 32 mg of methylprednisolone per day starting at the beginning of the chemotherapy. Multicystic kidney disease caused renal terminal insufficiency, which required continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for more than four months. The patient presented with a progressive shortness of breath, right-sided chest pain, and dysuria. He had no fever, and a physical exam showed right basal crackles. The laboratory test results were as follows: hemoglobin 9.7 g\/dL; neutrophils 12 \u00d7 10\/L; lymphocytes 4.2 \u00d7 10\/L with a CD4 lymphocyte count of 1.64 \u00d7 10\/L; serum creatinine 630 \u03bcmol\/L, and C-reactive protein 113.5 mg\/L (reference value <10 mg\/L). Additionally, two sets of blood cultures and urine culture were performed. Urine analysis revealed 1.3 \u00d7 10 leukocytes\/mL (normal range <10\/mL) and Gram-positive short bacilli at microscopic examination. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed multiple sub-pleural nodules in the right lower lobe that were adjacent to pleural thickening without pleural effusion, and consolidation in the middle lobe (Fig. 1). One of the nodules was excavated. The PET imaging performed to demonstrate deep infection showed an intense and diffuse accumulation of the deoxyglucose labeled with fluorine 18 (FDG) in the prostate (Fig. 2) revealing prostatitis. Chest CT scan showing right-sided multiple pulmonary nodules with cavitation (A) and parenchymal consolidation in the middle lobe (B). PET scan showing an intense and diffuse accumulation of the FDG in the prostate (A: PET imaging; B: scanned imaging of the prostate). A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and a CT-guided needle lung biopsy of the posterior nodule were performed. In the laboratory, tissue analysis found acute suppurative inflammation, with negative PAS, Grocott and Giemsa staining. Gram and acid-fast staining were processed and were negative on both samples. Standard culture performed on BAL was non-contributive, with polymicrobial non-pathogenic nasopharyngeal flora; mycobacterial and mycological cultures remained negative. Standard culture was not undertaken on the pulmonary biopsy because of its insufficient amount. Both samples were tested for tuberculosis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the MTB\/RIF test platform (GenExpert; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and were negative. PCR amplification and sequencing of 16S rDNA and 18S rDNA for the detection of bacteria and fungi, respectively, were performed on the pulmonary biopsy after dewaxing, and were negative. Four days after the patient's admission, growth was identified in one aerobic blood culture using the BacT Alert 3D culture system (BioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l\u2019Etoile, France). The bacterium was a non-motile, Gram-positive organism with branching filaments. Small, chalky white, rough colonies grew within 48 h when inoculated on boiled blood agar plates that were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. They were partially acid-fast and were considered to likely represent Nocardia spp. A Gram-positive bacterium was observed simultaneously in the urine culture, with more than 100,000 colonies\/mL. The two strains, from blood and urine cultures, were identified to the genus level as Nocardia spp. using the MALDI-TOF MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption\u2013ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry) system (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) after an extraction procedure. The identification to the species level as Nocardia veterana was obtained using a 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis (99.9% sequence matching with the type strain N. veterana DSM 44445). Prior to the isolation of Nocardia, the patient was empirically treated with intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (400 mg\/80 mg, twice daily) and ceftriaxone (750 mg twice daily). Doses were adapted to renal function, with hemodialysis performed three times per week. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed by the French Observatory of Nocardiosis (Lyon, France) by broth microdilution according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI0 methods and breakpoints).1 The profile revealed resistance to amoxicillin + clavulanate (MIC of 32\/16 \u03bcg\/mL), ciprofloxacin (MIC >4 \u03bcg\/mL) and doxycycline (MIC = 8 \u03bcg\/mL); intermediate susceptibility to gentamicin (MIC of 8 \u03bcg\/mL) and minocyclin (MIC = 2 \u03bcg\/mL); and susceptibility to cefotaxime (\u22644 \u03bcg\/mL), ceftriaxone (MIC = 8 \u03bcg\/mL), imipenem (MIC \u2264 2 \u03bcg\/mL), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (MIC \u2264 1\/19 \u03bcg\/mL) and linezolid (MIC \u2264 4 \u03bcg\/mL). After initiation of treatment, the respiratory symptoms slowly improved, and dysuria was completely resolved. The biological inflammatory syndrome decreased gradually, and a chest CT scan performed after one month of antibiotic therapy showed a moderate decrease in nodules size. Accordingly, the urinary and blood culture controls showed no remaining Nocardia. Unfortunately, due to glioblastoma progression, the patient's neurological status declined, and he died two months after the initial admission. Nocardiosis infections are caused by the saprophytic aerobic, Gram-positive, branching and filamentous bacilli belonging to the genus Nocardia. The identification of Nocardia isolates at the species level is critical for defining the spectrum of diseases that are caused by each species and to predict antimicrobial susceptibility.2 To date, approximately 90 species have been described (NCBI taxonomy for Nocardia), and a third of them have been implicated in human disease.3 If isolates grow well on blood agar plates, the routine identification of Nocardia strains using conventional phenotypical methods is a fastidious and time-consuming process that is now restricted to reference centers.2 In recent years, 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis has become accessible to clinical laboratories for definitive species identification.4 In our case, the strain of N. veterana was confirmed at the species level by almost complete 16S rDNA gene sequencing (1315 nt) by using SQ1 (5\u2032-AGAGTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3\u2032) and SQ6 (5\u2032-CGGTGTGTACAAGGCCC-3\u2032) primers, according to previous published data.5 The sequences obtained presented a 99.9% sequence similarity (one difference out of 1315 nt, excluding the primers) to the type strain N. veterana DSM 44445. The MALDI-TOF MS identification systems are based on the comparison of the tested isolate mass spectrum with reference databases. Previous studies reported that the Bruker MALDI-TOF MS system accurately identified species from the genus Nocardia spp.6 but a preliminary extraction step was mandatory to obtain satisfactory results. In our case, the identification was obtained to the genus level after an extraction procedure in two steps (boiling followed by ethanol\u2013formic acid extraction). At first, the identification by the direct colony method failed to identify the bacterium, although it has been recently published with other MALDI-TOF MS systems.7 N. veterana is a species that was characterized in 2001.8 The difficulties in the identification of this species, until recently, may imply that it is more common as a human pathogen than previously reported.9 Indeed, little is known about N. veterana because few cases of clinical importance have been published. One isolate was from a brain abscess10; three were reported in patients with pulmonary infections2, 11, 12, 13, 14; one isolate was recovered in a bowel abscess and was associated with colon carcinoma15; two cases of mycetomas from Japan were published16, 17; one isolate has been recovered from ascitic fluid,8 one was responsible for an endogenous endophtalmitis,18 and recently, a case of N. veterana causing nodular lymphangitis was reported.19 Bloodstream infection due to N. veterana is a rare condition. In our case, this pathogen was isolated from blood and urine cultures, and this is the first reported case of urinary tract infection due to N. veterana. This implies that the infectious spectrum of N. veterana could be relatively broad. Like other species of Nocardia spp., N. veterana causes infections mainly in immunocompromised hosts. As predisposing factors, the patient was administered long-term corticosteroid and chemotherapy (including temozolomide) for neoplastic disease. However, in a recent study of nocardiosis and AIDS, it was shown that despite deep immunodepression, nocardiosis was an uncommon complication. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which is used in primary prophylaxis for toxoplasmosis, could be effective against nocardiosis as well. It is unclear how our patient became infected by N. veterana. Pulmonary infection is the most common site of nocardiosis, and it is usually acquired by inhalation of sporulated fragmented nocardial mycelia found in the environment.11, 20 Most of the time, diagnosis is based on the isolation of Nocardia from respiratory samples. In our case, we identified a disseminated N. veterana infection with the presence of this bacterium in peripheral blood culture and urine. The hypothesis of airborne contamination, with an infection that was initially limited to the lung and a secondary hematological dissemination, sometimes to the central nervous system and soft tissue,8 may be considered. However, we have not proved the presence of N. veterana in the chest, although there were several indications of its presence, including the patient's pulmonary presentation, chest CT scan features with nodules and parenchymal consolidation12 (Fig. 1) and the negativity of all bacteriological chest sampling for other pathogens. The contamination of the BAL by non-pathogenic nasopharyngeal flora of the upper respiratory tract could have interfered with culturing of Nocardia spp. We have no explanation for the negativity of PCR amplification of 16S rDNA performed on the pulmonary biopsy after dewaxing; the low sensitivity of PCR amplification could explain the result. Furthermore, the role of CAPD must be considered, as several cases of peritoneal nocardiosis have been reported.21 Our patient had daily home- and self-made CAPD, which could have been a predisposing factor for this infection because of non-optimal skills. We did not perform bacteriological testing of ascitic fluid because our patient had no abdominal pain, which makes the hypothesis of CAPD-induced contamination less likely. The antimicrobial agents to be used against N. veterana remain controversial due to discrepancies regarding methodological variations, differences in interpretations concerning breakpoints and, therefore, susceptibilities. Based on limited in vitro studies of antimicrobial agents against this microorganism, the empiric drug of choice for this pathogen would be trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole9, 22 at a dose of 10\u201315 mg\/kg daily. In our case, N. veterana remained sensitive to trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole and ceftriaxone, which was the initial empirical treatment. The treatment of nocardiosis must be extended by considering many factors, such as the severity of infection or the immunizing status. In the previously published cases, the duration of treatment ranged from a few weeks to a number of years based on expert opinion on the treatment of other Nocardia infections.10 Because the patient died two months after the initial admission, we could not evaluate his response to the antibiotic treatment."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Nocardia veterana cause?","id":"185-3-3-1","answers":[{"text":"urinary tract infection","answer_start":50,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"In conclusion, this is the first reported case of urinary tract infection due to N. veterana.

They cause a variety of suppurative and granulomatous infections in humans, ranging from localized cutaneous mycetomas to disseminated systemic disease (2, 19). While Nocardia spp. can cause disease in an immunocompetent host (16), they are often considered opportunistic pathogens, causing disease in settings of compromised immunity, such as organ transplantation or lymphoreticular neoplasia (2, 18). Identification of Nocardia isolates to the species level is important to define the spectrum of diseases caused by each species and to predict antimicrobial susceptibility (16). While the number of species that make up the genus Nocardia is rapidly expanding, the majority (\u223c80%) of pulmonary and disseminated infections are caused by the members of the Nocardia asteroides complex (2, 18). Less frequently, other Nocardia species, like N. braziliensis, N. transvalensis, and N. otitidiscavarium, have also been implicated (2). Recently, Hamid et al. reported the isolation of a new pathogenic species, N. africana, from sputum samples of patients with chronic pulmonary infections in Africa (9).

In many cases a child with VUR has no symptoms, but if present, the most common complication is urinary tract infection (UTI). The most common test used to diagnose VUR is a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). The standard treatment for VUR has included prompt treatment of UTIs and long-term use of antibiotics to prevent UTIs until VUR diminishes spontaneously.

Although these bacteria are regarded as having low pathogenicity, N. mucosa has been reported before to cause serious infections such as endocarditis and now in our case-report a complicated urinary tract infection. N. mucosa is non-motile, non-acid fast, non-sporeforming bacteria and resembles a coffee bean when viewed microscopically. It grows optimally at temperatures ranging 35-37 \u00b0C, and growth is usually stimulated by CO2 and humidity [6]. These are conditions occurring in the urinary tract. N. mucosa may be transmitted by contact with droplets and discharges from the nose and throat of infected persons. The infection however is rare due to low virulence [7, 8]. During hospitalization of our patient, his parents told us that the four family members had an upper respiratory tract infection. In theory they could sneeze and cough the bacteria into the vesicostomy of our patient or he could do this by himself. The exact pathogenesis of N. mucosa is unkown. It is known that it has some similarities with that of N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae. For example: N. mucosa has also the ability to invade and replicate within neutrophils, as well avoiding phagocytosis and being killed by complement by resisting opsonization by antibodies, which target the pathogen for destruction. Furthermore N. mucosa contains porins which are an important factor for complement inhibition. The ability to translocate into host cells and modulate reactive oxygen species production and apoptosis is also made possible by porins [7]. All the described infections caused by normally commensal N. species were in individuals with underlying medical conditions and\/or immune suppression or deficiency. Our patient has a vesicostomy, which can be considered as an easy porte d'entr\u00e9e for bacteria. Having a VUR Grade 5 on the left side, he is at risk for opportunistic infections. When our patient was admitted to the hospital a bladder catheter was inserted in his vesicostomy, and during several episodes (maximum 6 weeks) as an outpatient a catheter was situated in his vesicostomy. In theory N. mucosa could have colonized on the catheter. However, it is unknown if N. mucosa survives on plastic. Since a significant amount of leucocytes in the urine were seen and we had an axenic culture with this microorganism, N. mucosa is very likely to be the urinary tract pathogen in this case. This is underwritten, since the UTI resolved by the antimicrobial therapy. Relatively little attention has been paid to other Neisseria species than N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae, as they have generally been regarded as harmless organisms of little clinical importance. While it is true to say that N. mucosa does not rank among the major pathogens encountered in the field of infectious diseases, it looks that it may cause infections more frequently than is usually appreciated. Microbiologists should be cautious in dismissing N. mucosa too readily as part of non-pathogen flora, when it is isolated from clinical material [8]."}]}]},{"species":"Neisseria subflava","docs":[{"title":"A case of meningitis due to Neisseria subflava after ventriculostomy","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does N. subflava normally exist?","id":"187-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"human upper respiratory tract","answer_start":837,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Neisseria subflava cause?","id":"187-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"SSI","answer_start":212,"id":1},{"text":"meningitis","answer_start":906,"id":2},{"text":"meningitis","answer_start":946,"id":3},{"text":"meningitis","answer_start":1078,"id":4},{"text":"postoperative meningitis","answer_start":1327,"id":5}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Surgical site infection (SSI) is an emerging problem in all fields of surgery, as well as in neurosurgery, with numerous strategies against SSI initiated in many countries.

Overall incidence of IE is approximately 3-10 per 100,000 persons, with recent global mortality rates ranging from 4% to 48% [1,2]. Predisposing risk factors of IE include structural heart disease, presence of prosthetic valves or cardiac devices, such as pacemakers or defibrillators, intravenous (IV) drug use, immunosuppression or recent invasive procedures [3]. Gram-positive cocci, such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Enterococcus species, account for 80%-90% of IE cases, with Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci comprising 25% and 22% of cases, respectively [1,4]. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a subtype of S. aureus with greater infectivity due to increased antibiotic resistance, has long been considered one of the leading causes of septicemia\/bacteremia and endocarditis. Although common clinical practice is to assess all patients with S. aureus bacteremia for IE, only a fraction ultimately develop IE, with studies showing the prevalence of IE in patients with S. aureus to be 13%-25% [5]. Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) also have been discovered to have a propensity for causing IE, albeit in uncommon situations. The reported incidence of IE caused by GNB varies, with range 1.3%-10% [6]. Of the GNB, the HACEK group of bacteria (Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Aggregatibacter spp., Cardiobacterium spp., Eiknella corrodens, Kingella spp.) are most commonly associated with IE, accounting for 1.2%-3% of cases [7]. In the last few decades, however, the advent of non-HACEK species of GNB causing IE has been identified, with very few cases published in medical literature.

Infectivity of these Neisseria species is very uncommon, but similar to other more virulent strains of GNB, can ultimately lead to severe systemic illness in certain circumstances. Of the relatively few published cases of IE involving non-meningococcal, non-gonococcal Neisseria species, Neisseria elongata and Neisseria sicca have been the most abundant. N. subflava is characterized as a gram-negative diplococcal saprophyte of the oral cavity that is chromogenic, grows at 22\u00b0C, is able to ferment glucose, maltose and sucrose, and produce H2S [9]. N. flavescens is very similar to N. subflava, with few microbiological differences that are incompletely understood. From our literature search, only 12 cases of IE caused by N. subflava have been reported, with even fewer numbers for N. flavescens, the first case being reported in 1987 [10]. Suggested risk factors include pre-existing valvular abnormalities or underlying cardiac lesions, immunosuppression (asplenia, chronic hepatitis, HIV, diabetes) and dental conditions (abscesses) [11]. In the past, IV drug use was widely considered to be the most common predisposing risk factor for non-HACEK IE [12]. Recent investigation into non-HACEK organism IE has shed insight onto the possibility of intravascular catheters as a risk factor for IE caused by atypical organisms. In a multicenter study of 26 patients with non-HACEK IE, the most prominent risk factor observed was the presence of an intravascular catheter (e.g. hemodialysis catheter, central venous catheter). Although N. flavescens\/subflava and other non-meningococcal, non-gonococcal species of Neisseria are not classified as non-HACEK organisms, there may be a connection between these two groups based on the risk factors predisposing to IE. Our patient was both an IV drug user and had an intravascular catheter in the form of a PICC line, coupled with a previously damaged valve from prior MRSA IE, all likely made him increasingly susceptible to an atypical organism such as N. flavescens\/subflava. Besides risk factors, few other similarities between non-meningococcal, non-gonococcal Neisseria species and HACEK bacteria exist. HACEK-IE vegetations have been shown on average to be larger compared to vegetations caused by viridans group streptococci (11.5 mm vs 9 mm), and these vegetations have higher rates of embolization [13]. Our patient was found to have a large vegetation (21 mm) and clinical evidence of embolization, further demonstrating the similarities between HACEK organisms and non-meningococcal, non-gonococcal Neisseria. Neisseria-induced endocarditis usually results in an acute febrile endocarditis with large vegetations and a destructive process that often causes severe cardiac and systemic complications such as systemic embolization, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, heart failure and myocardial abscesses [14]. The pathogenesis of how this occurs in Neisseria-induced IE remains largely unclear. It was previously thought GNB were rarely implicated in IE due to their inability to form biofilms as well as their relatively low affinity for cardiac endocardial tissue [12]. Newer research has shown N. subflava exhibit biofilm-related phenotypes that are not often seen by laboratory strains [15]. Furthermore, it was shown that similar biofilm phenotypes were observed in Streptococcus mitis, a viridans group Streptococcus also known to cause IE. It is highly possible N. subflava and other Neisseria species are more related to typical IE causing bacteria that was previously thought, but more research is needed to decipher these similarities. Traditionally, these commensal Neisseria species, including N. flavescens\/subflava, were treated with penicillin antibiotics. However, in the 1970s, research studies found that N. flavescens\/subflava were capable of beta-lactamase production, thus rendering penicillin antibiotics largely ineffective [10]. Of note, studies of HACEK organisms also have shown their capability to synthesize beta-lactamase, making third-generation cephalosporins the primary antibiotic choice for HACEK-IE treatment [13]. Our patient was treated with cefepime, with subsequent repeat negative blood cultures and discharged on a longer course of ceftriaxone."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Neisseria subflava normally exist?","id":"187-2-4-1","answers":[{"text":"human respiratory tract","answer_start":151,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of Neisseria subflava?","id":"187-2-4-2","answers":[{"text":"non-pathogenic","answer_start":117,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Few reports have described IE caused by non-meningococcal, non-gonococcal GNB.

The present investigation examined the antimicrobial susceptibility of 45 isolates of N. subflava from the oral cavities of Japanese men and women to various agents used for the treatment of gonococcal infections.

The clinical symptom and lab tests properties of this case are high fever rate, empyema, elevated WBC, increased CRP value and distinctive imaging changes, all these often lead to a fatal infection as reported infection caused by N. flavescens in the other systems (4,6,7,19). We reviewed the literatures and analysed the possible reason may be included the following issues: N. flavescens is among the commensal flora of human upper respiratory tract, seldom cause human infection. Most of N. flavescens infected patients have severe basic diseases, for example, immunodeficiency and diabetes (2); There are remote causes like dental surgery history, vomiting, chemotherapy and co-infection with HIV or pseudomonas aeruginosa (18,21); Initial experienced clinical application of penicillin and cefixime often failed to cure the N. flavescens infection for beta-lactamase producing and penA resistant gene expression (5,22-30); severe virulence and inflammatory response caused by lipooligosaccharide of Neisseria lead to septic shock and fibrinoid necrosis and exudation (31).

Preexisting heart diseases (valvular or congenital heart disease) are the primary risk factors for N. elongata endocarditis including our case who had bicuspid aortic valve. Endocarditis due to these saprophytic Neisseriae usually results in an acute febrile illness and a large vegetation. Disease is often destructive, associated with severe complications, especially systemic embolism and perivalvular abscesses. In our case, the patient presented with acute endocarditis with a large mobile mass, associating with severe aortic regurgitation, an aortic root abscess and an associated perforation. The valve destruction was considered to have been induced by N. elongata. Delay in diagnosis is mainly due either to absence of a murmur at presentation, or to difficulty in identifying the organism. No guidelines exist to direct the antibiotic choice or duration for treatment of N. elongata endocarditis. Detailed susceptibility profile testing is required as N. elongata demonstrates a reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone, as with our patient, and variable sensitivities to penicillin and trimethoprim. Otherwise, the organism is usually susceptible to amoxicillin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. A previous study has shown that ciprofloxacin can be a great oral option for treatment of N. elongata endocarditis given its excellent bioavailability. Furthermore, the review of the literature including our case suggest that endocarditis caused by N. elongata requires surgical intervention."},{"qas":[{"question":"What about the pathogenicity of N. elongata?","id":"189-1-4-1","answers":[{"text":"nonpathogenic","answer_start":52,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can N. elongata cause?","id":"189-1-4-2","answers":[{"text":"infective endocarditis","answer_start":95,"id":1},{"text":"endocarditis","answer_start":272,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"We conclude that N. elongata, previously considered nonpathogenic, can be a causative agent of infective endocarditis mostly affecting young adults with underlying valvular disease.

N. cinerea is an oxidase-positive and catalase-positive, gram-negative diplococci. The bacteria share many morphological and biochemical similarities with Neisseria gonorrhea and Branhamella catarrhalis. Neisseria cinerea is able to reduce glucose like N. gonorrhea but not able to utilize it for energy, making it asaccharolytic. Amino acids like cysteine, cystine, proline and arginine are required for its growth. Unlike Neisseria gonorrhea, N. cinerea can grow on mediums like Mueller-Hinton agar and trypticase soy agar, and is not resistant to colistin [4]. As described earlier, Neisseria cinerea normally colonizes human oropharynx but very rarely enters the bloodstream.

The most common pathogen among Neisseria species causing IE remain to be N. gonorrhoeae, usually presented with large vegetation that involves the aortic valve, accompanied by ring abscesses in young males. N. elongate infection is another aggressive form of endocarditis, many of which required valve replacement at early time [5\u20137]. N. macacae is a Gram-negative diplococcus and was first detected as a new species in the oropharynx of healthy Rhesus Monkeys [1]. To our knowledge, N. macacae is an uncommon cause of endocarditis, only one fatal case has been reported before our study. The patient of that fatal case underwent cardiac surgery on an emergency basis 5 weeks after the diagnosis of IE and died 4 days after surgery [1]. Our patient underwent cardiac surgery on 1 week after the diagnosis of IE, and thus, early surgery may be one of the key factors in decreasing the risk of systemic embolism and enhance survival. In this case, we further sequenced the vegetation by nanopore sequencing and identified the Neisseria sequences was detected in the vegetation, which further confirmed the diagnosis of Neisseria sp. infectious endocarditis. Next-generation sequencing enabled rapid and accurate microbiological diagnostics could provide a clinically actionable diagnosis of uncommon pathogen and facilitate tailored treatments [8]. High throughput sequencing technologies could also help overcome some limitations of the traditional culture, which includes a longer period of time for some pathogens to report positive and non-comprehensive coverage of all the microorganisms. As a previous study described, whole metagenome shotgun sequencing may be used as a diagnostic procedure to strengthen the diagnosis of IE and to obtain draft genomic sequence of the pathogen and typing information [9]. In our study, the earliest time to report possible detection of Neisseria sp. is 1 h, which further illustrated the advantages of the nanopore sequencing in accelerating the diagnostic speed. Currently, new technical advances such as nanopore sequencing have already allowed another step forward of sequencing methods. In our department, we tracked carbapenem-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae outbreak in an intensive care unit by Illumina short read and Nanopore long-read sequencing [10]. In comparison to the previous generation sequencing technologies, the new sequencing technologies provide two important advantages: the ability to sequence single molecules, thus avoiding one of the main sources of bias introduced during library preparation, the PCR amplification step, and, most importantly, the increased read length of their output [11]. Most patients with non-HACEK Gram-negative bacteria like N. macacae infective endocarditis require extended antibiotic therapy and early surgical evaluation [12].

There have only been two reports of Neisseria bacteremia in humans including a 5-month-old child and a healthy adult [1, 2]. This is the first report of two cases of Neisseria bacteremia in patients with cancer, one of whom had recovered from cancer. N. macacae is known to reside in the mouth of monkeys [3]; however, neither of our patients had a history of contact with monkeys. Only one case of infectious endocarditis in an adult with N. macacae bacteremia was reported [2].  N. macacae isolated in human samples review NA Not available Previously, reports of N. macacae infection in humans include peritonitis in patients on peritoneal dialysis [5]. Addtionally, N. macacae has been isolated from the upper respiratory tract of neutropenic patients [4]. No neutropenia or no respiratory infections such as pneumonia and infective endocarditis were observed in our patients. In addition, echoendoscope colonization was reported, suggesting that it may have been established in the upper digestive tract of humans [6]. Among patients who used antibiotics within a month, N. macacae accounted for 4.5% of Neisseria species that colonized in the oral cavity [4]. Neither of our patients had used antibiotics within 1 month of admission, but both had previously been treated with antibiotics and chemotherapy. In both cases, mucosal damage was observed in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, exclusion diagnosis suggested that bacteremia invasion was caused by mucosal rupture in our cases. There are no clear susceptibility testing methods or criteria for N. macacae detection, and the treatment for Neisseria bacteremia is unknown. Therefore, susceptibility testing was performed using the CLSI meningococcal criterion; however, it is unknown whether these results are appropriate. Both patients responded well to treatment with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and improved after 2 weeks. The duration of treatment is unknown. Modifying the treatment based on the source of the infection may shorten the treatment period. Therefore, further research on N. macacae bacteremia is necessary. Common Neisseria species that are pathogenic to humans include N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis. 16S sequence analysis may not be sufficient to identify Neisseria species due to high intraspecies sequence variation in the 16S rRNA gene [4]. Neisseria species can be differentiated based on their morphological, physiological, and biochemical properties and MALDI-TOF MS results. Commensal Neisseria species that colonize oral and nasal cavity sites have only been rarely associated with disease [7]. Donati et al. have shown that commensal species have tropism for different sites in the oral cavity and oropharynx. Neisseria meningitidis is enriched for colonization in the throat, N. flavescens and N. subflava populate the tongue dorsum, and N. sicca, N. mucosa, and N. elongata the gingival plaque [8]. Interestingly, Bennett et al. have demonstrated that N. subflava and N. flavescens are phylogenetically the same species. Similarly, researchers have proposed that both N. sicca and N. macacae be reclassified as N. mucosa [9, 10]. The limitation of this report was that Neisseria spp. is difficult to fully identify with only 16sRNA. In 34% (29\/85) cases of identification of the Neisseria spp., 16S rRNA sequence analysis indicated the possibility of more than one species [4]. Therefore, the usefulness of MALDI-TOF for the identification of Neisseria spp. is being examined. In CASE 2, the 16sRNA analysis results showed that N. macacae, N. sicca and N. mucosa were the three possible species. A combination of biochemical tests ruled out N. mucosa but did not differentiate N. macacae from N. sica.

Reference to the contagious nature of gonococcal infection dates back to biblical times (Lev. 15:1-15:19), making gonorrhea one of the oldest recorded human diseases. Today, gonococcal infection remains a major global health problem, as more than sixty million cases are reported annually worldwide (78). The highest incidence of disease and disease sequelae occurs in less well developed countries; however, greater than 300,000 cases are reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States each year (41). Teenagers and young adults are at high risk for infection, which is unsettling in view of the increased risk associated with gonorrhea for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (264). The gonococcus-induced increase in the local expression of viral RNA, in conjunction with the acute inflammatory response generated with gonococcal disease and the subsequent loss of mucosal integrity, is associated with the increased susceptibility to HIV type 1 (42). In addition, susceptibility to chronic complications associated with N. gonorrhoeae disease is a specific problem in women because of the asymptomatic nature commonly associated with gonococcal cervicitis and the subsequent spread to the upper genital tract (26, 58, 59, 134, 229). Ascending gonococcal infection occurs in up to 45% of infected women (26, 109, 134, 229) and can result in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can cause permanent fallopian tube scarring and blockage, with subsequent infertility and ectopic pregnancies. One in 10 women suffers from PID (8), of which N. gonorrhoeae is the etiological agent in 40% of all reported cases (241). N. gonorrhoeae is an exclusive human pathogen that primarily infects the urogenital epithelia. Although the urethra and the uterine cervix serve as the initial sites for gonococcal infection in men and women, respectively, infections of the conjunctiva, pharynx, and rectal mucosa are also reported. N. gonorrhoeae infection of these distinctly different epithelial cell surfaces leads to a spectrum of clinical manifestations of disease (reviewed in references 58, 109, and 229). Disseminated disease, although uncommon, can cause arthritis-dermatitis syndrome, endocarditis, and\/or meningitis. Studies reveal that the gonococcus can enter human cells (257), but only recently has it been shown that the organism is intracellular during human infection (5). A repertoire of virulence factors have been identified and allow this bacterium to successfully adapt to variable microenvironments within its sole human host. This human adaptability and the repeated phase and antigenic change displayed by the gonococcus have hampered vaccine development. Many of the major virulence factors undergo phase and\/or antigenic variation (227), including the pilus (56, 73), opacity-associated (Opa) outer membrane proteins (139, 229), and lipooligosaccharide (LOS) (32, 53, 211, 270). Porin expression is stable for any given strain of N. gonorrhoeae, and the porin is present as either a PI.A or a PI.B isotype. Porin is highly immunogenic (104, 226). However, porin is intimately associated with reduction-modifiable protein (Rmp or P.III) (21, 25, 27, 152, 180) and with LOS (107) in the outer gonococcal membrane. Blocking antibodies to Rmp (68, 121, 151, 203, 204, 205) and to LOS (68) impair an efficacious immune response developed against porin. Therefore, a functional immune response may be only minimally stimulated by gonococcal infection or by vaccination (105, 245). This paper is not a global review of neisserial pathogenesis but rather attempts to incorporate into a working model recent advances made in understanding the molecular factors involved in gonococcal infection and in disease progression and transmission. It is hoped that assembling such a model in the context of the human male and female (uro)genital tracts (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1)1) will complement our understanding of gonococcal pathogenesis at the level of human disease. The reader is directed to the writings of several researchers who have eloquently reviewed specific factors currently thought to contribute to neisserial pathogenesis (55, 102, 163, 192). (A to C) Working model of gonococcal pathogenesis within the lower female genital tract. Alternative pathway complement components are produced and released by the cervical epithelia (A). Upon N. gonorrhoeae infection, complement is activated. Gonococcal pilus binds to the I-domain of CR3 allowing the bacterium to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between its own cell surface and that of the host cell. This places the gonococcus within proximity to the cervical cell surface where complement components would be sufficient to allow deposition upon the bacterial cell surface (B). C3b forms a covalent association with the lipid A core of gonococcal LOS and is rapidly inactivated to iC3b. The affinity of gonococcal porin for factor H may augment iC3b formation. The proximity of porin to LOS in the outer membrane may spatially favor the intimate association between iC3b and porin with the CR3 I-domain (C [inset]). Engagement of CR3 triggers a complex signal transduction cascade mediated by the Src-family tyrosine kinases and Rho GTPases (C). These processes result in vinculin- and ezrin-enriched focal complex formation and membrane ruffling, i.e., trigger mechanism of invasion. Secreted NgPLD modulates cervical cell signal transduction by playing a role in CR3 recruitment to the cervical cell surface and by modulating cytoskeletal reorganization. Additionally this protein augments intracellular survival of gonococci after their internalization within macropinosomes. Sialylated gonococci are eventually released from the cervical cell, where they are free to invade more of the cervical epithelia or where they become primed for transmission to the male urethra upon sialic acid removal by sialidases present within the female genital tract. (D) Invasion of the male urethral epithelium is mediated by an interaction between the terminal galactose moiety of LOS and the ASGP-R. (E) An intimate association occurs between the gonococcus and the urethral cell membrane, i.e., the zippering mechanism of invasion. Clathrin is recruited to the site of ASGP-R, and gonococcus-ASGP-R complexes are internalized in clathrin-coated pits in an actin-dependent process. Within the endosome a drop in pH is proposed to release the ASGP-R from the gonococcus surface, and clathrin molecules are lost. ASGP-R is recruited to the urethral cell surface, where it is available to serve as a receptor for more gonococci. (F) Engagement of the ASGP-R triggers cellular responses resulting in membrane pedestal formation beneath receptor-gonococcus complexes and activation of transcription factors required for the production of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1. Neutrophil influx accompanies cytokine release. Sialylated gonococci are eventually released from the urethral epithelium, where they can then be transmitted to a female partner. However, sialic acid on the gonococcus surface does not influence the ability of these organisms to associate with the uterine cervix."}]},{"title":"The laboratory diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Neisseria gonorrhoeae cause?","id":"193-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gonorrhea","answer_start":84,"id":1},{"text":"cervicitis in women, and urethritis, pharyngitis and proctitis in both sexes","answer_start":113,"id":2},{"text":"severe sequelae of pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy and tubal infertility","answer_start":226,"id":3},{"text":"epididymitis, prostatitis and urethral stricture","answer_start":358,"id":4},{"text":"disseminated infections with systemic complications","answer_start":455,"id":5},{"text":"conjunctivitis","answer_start":797,"id":6},{"text":"ocular infections (ophthalmia neonatorum","answer_start":878,"id":7}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Neisseria gonorrhoeae is an obligate human pathogen and is the etiological agent of gonorrhea.

Occasionally, some individuals may develop disseminated infections with systemic complications, while others may have asymptomatic infections and transmit gonococci unknowingly. Oropharyngeal and anorectal gonococcal infections may be acquired by persons practicing receptive oral or anal intercourse or by contamination from cervical secretions. Occasionally, adults may present with conjunctivitis. Newborns exposed to infected secretions during birth may develop ocular infections (ophthalmia neonatorum) but the incidence of this is low in Canada, with only six reported cases in 1998 (2) due to routine eye prophylaxis (1). When handling clinical specimens or N gonorrhoeae cultures, biosafety precautions should be taken, including the use of protective goggles to protect the eyes from splashed infectious material and inadvertent touching with contaminated hands. The incidence of gonococcal infections in Canada peaked in 1985 with an infection rate of 157 cases\/100,000 population and declined to 17.6 cases\/100,000 population in 1999. The drastic decrease in infection rates in Canada was partly due to improved public health interventions (1), including the use of single dose antibiotic therapies, enhanced contact tracing and surveillance, improved diagnostic methods and implementation of educational programs. Between 1997 and 2001, the national rate of reported gonorrhea cases increased by 53% among men and 33% among women (3). To ensure that the recommended therapies are efficacious, an ongoing surveillance program has been in place since the 1970s to monitor the prevalence and emergence of antimicrobial-resistant strains in different parts of Canada. The antibiotic-resistant strains are further characterized by typing methods and compared with international surveillance data.

Colonies are positive by the oxidase test and most strains utilize maltose. The phenotypic classification of meningococci, based on structural differences in capsular polysaccharide, lipooligosaccharide (LOS) and outer membrane proteins, is now complemented by genome sequence typing (ST). The epidemiological profile of N. meningitidis is variable in different populations and over time and virulence of the meningococcus is based on a transformable\/plastic genome and expression of certain capsular polysaccharides (serogroups A, B, C, W-135, Y and X) and non-capsular antigens. N. meningitidis colonizes mucosal surfaces using a multifactorial process involving pili, twitching motility, LOS, opacity associated, and other surface proteins. Certain clonal groups have an increased capacity to gain access to the blood, evade innate immune responses, multiply, and cause systemic disease.

This organism is also involved in extraoral infections such as nasopharyngeal infection and intra-abdominal infection (10). It was recognized that there is heterogeneity within P. intermedia strains in terms of serology and DNA homology. In 1992, a comprehensive DNA-DNA hybridization study proposed that P. intermedia be classified into two genospecies, P. intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens (18). Previous studies suggest that P. intermedia is likely to be more associated with periodontal sites, whereas P. nigrescens seems to be more frequently recovered from healthy gingivae, although the site specificities of these two species remain controversial (7, 11, 20). It is of interest to investigate how humans get P. intermedia and P. nigrescens in the oral cavity and what the consequence of acquisition of these organisms is. So far there are few reports in the literature on the incidence or transmission of P. intermedia and P. nigrescens within families (11, 20). Establishment of efficient typing systems for P. intermedia and P. nigrescens is fundamental for epidemiological study of infecting or colonizing clones and for tracing the transmission of microorganisms from person to person. The techniques which have been used to type P. intermedia and P. nigrescens include sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2, 19), restriction endonuclease analysis (2, 15), ribotyping (15), and arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) (10, 12). These techniques are time-consuming or have low levels of reproducibility. PCR ribotyping, which is expected to amplify the 16S and 23S spacer regions of bacterial rRNA genes by PCR, has been demonstrated to be a simple, rapid, and reliable typing technique (1, 8, 13). PCR ribotyping generates simple banding patterns and, thus, allows comparison of results obtained in separate PCR amplifications, whereas AP-PCR does not work in this manner. Recent studies have suggested that the use of multiple typing systems would be more reliable and would give a higher discriminatory power than any one typing system for the typing of microorganisms (3, 6, 17). In this study, we established a typing system for P. intermedia and P. nigrescens using the combination of PCR ribotyping and AP-PCR fingerprinting and applied the established typing system to the study of intrafamilial carriage of these species in the oral cavity."}]},{"title":"Proteomic analysis of the periodontal pathogen Prevotella intermedia secretomes in biofilm and planktonic lifestyles","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Prevotella intermedia cause?","id":"197-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"periodontitis","answer_start":62,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Prevotella intermedia is an important species associated with periodontitis.

Many of the secreted proteins often function in nutrient acquisition, but in pathogenic bacteria, they play a key role in disease, e.g., by helping the bacteria in host colonization or by modulating host immune responses. Thus, extracellular secretion of bacterial proteins is an important virulence mechanism. To achieve this, bacteria have devised various strategies, e.g., dedicated secretory systems and extracellular vesicles. The central components of the main protein translocation system, the Sec system, share a high degree of sequence similarity between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Oral infectious diseases such as caries and periodontitis are dental plaque biofilm-driven. Dental plaque is a structurally and functionally organized, highly complex multispecies biofilm. The resident bacteria in this multispecies community exhibit extensive interactions while forming biofilm structures, carrying out physiological functions, and inducing microbial pathogenesis. Interspecies interactions in biofilms are competitive, cooperative and, antagonistic. To facilitate such interactions, plaque bacteria may release several cellular components into the extracellular space within the biofilm matrix. In addition, proteins secreted in biofilms may have specific effects in terms of the virulence properties of biofilm residents, which could influence the overall pathogenicity of biofilms. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by mild to moderately severe inflammation of the periodontal tissue, progressive destruction of ligament fibers, as well as alveolar bone loss. The disease is primarily related to chronic plaque accumulation in a susceptible host. Major bacterial species implicated in periodontitis are Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and others. Prevotella intermedia occurs frequently in the subgingival samples of periodontitis patients. Further, presence of Prevotella has been positively correlated with clinical attachment loss, bleeding on probing, and periodontal ()inflammation. P. intermedia is a Gram-negative, non-motile, rod-shaped, bacterium that requires strict anaerobic conditions for growth. In addition to oral infections, P. intermedia has also been detected from nonoral sites, e.g., NOMA (cancrum oris) lesions and bacterial tracheitis in children. Further, chronic oral infections such as periodontitis in which P. intermedia is a major species, increase the risk of systemic diseases, such as atherosclerosis, pre-term delivery of low birth-weight infants. Importantly, P. intermedia is known to be resistant to several antibiotics including cephalosporins, penicillins and tetracyclins. Since P. intermedia is not an exogenous pathogen and is a part of normal oral microbiota, its complete elimination is not possible. Despite the remarkable clinical significance P. intermedia has, little is known about the molecular basis for its virulence. For P. intermedia to survive in a complex and competitive oral environment, it is imperative that it can adhere to surfaces and integrate into plaque biofilm. In general, bacterial cells dispersed from mature plaque biofilms are collected by saliva and can be regarded as planktonic cells. Such planktonic bacterial cells can reattach to oral surfaces and initiate new biofilm growth. Recent knowledge from the literature suggests that virulence potentials of the biofilms and the planktonic cells are remarkably different. Previously, even though different aspects of P. intermedia as part of plaque biofilm have been studied, extracellular proteins secreted by this species (secretome), in biofilm or in planktonic life form, has not been investigated."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can P. intermedia cause?","id":"197-3-3-1","answers":[{"text":"periodontitis","answer_start":5035,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are P. intermedia sensitive to?","id":"197-3-3-2","answers":[{"text":"histidine kinases","answer_start":2021,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Protein secretion is a fundamental physiological process among bacteria. However, the components of the secretome may vary depending on the niche where the bacteria are located. Biofilm life is a modus operandi for most oral bacteria. Bacterial residents of plaque biofilms continuously release cellular components into the extracellular environment in the biofilm. Interestingly, in this study, proteins such as superoxide reductase, sensor histidine kinase, C40 family peptidase, elongation factor Tu, threonine synthase, which are known to play important roles in bacterial virulence and colonization in the host, were unique to biofilm secretome. Thus, fundamental differences, including those with respect to protein secretion, may exist between the biofilm and planktonic mode of life. The possibility of contamination of the secretome preparations with subcellular proteins resulting from cell lysis was ruled out by using an established cytoplasmic marker protein Fts-Z which was undetected in all P. intermedia secretome preparations. Potential virulence factors in the secretome preparations were predicted by in silico analysis. While the total number of predicted virulence factors did not differ between the two secretomes, only six proteins, including thioredoxin, trypsin and hemin-binding protein, were common between them. This is an interesting finding given the fundamental differences of bacteria in biofilm and planktonic modes of life. In the subgingival environment where P. intermedia is part of the plaque biofilm encountering a multitude of host challenges, it probably needs to secrete an entirely different set of proteins with virulence potential compared to the planktonic form of life. Of noteworthy virulence factors in the biofilm secretome were thioredoxin, hemin-binding protein, peptidase M6, NADH oxidase and trypsin. In the case of planktonic secretome, enoyl-ACP reductase, PorT family protein, peptidase M20, and glycosyltransferase were some of the important ones. Interestingly, histidine kinases, which were found in both biofilm and planktonic secretomes, are recently proposed to be attractive antibacterial drug targets. Further, hemin-binding protein that plays a role in bacterial interaction with host cells, glycosyltransferases that mediate biofilm formation. Similarly, virulence potential of other proteins such as NADH oxidase and thioredoxin has been well established in several other bacterial pathogens. To get an insight into the functional significance of the proteins identified from the P. intermedia proteomes, Gene Ontology analysis was carried out on the FASTA sequences. The biofilm secretome contained higher percentage of proteins in \u201cbiological processes\u201d category with catabolic process, cellular amino acid metabolic process, cellular nitrogen compound process. Biofilm secretome also showed higher number of proteins with protein binding, methyl transferase and kinase activities. Interestingly, the planktonic secretome appeared to possess higher percentage of proteins with peptidase activity, compared to the biofilm secretome. In another important periodontal pathogen P. gingivalis, certain peptidases were important for the survival of the species but not sufficient for its virulence. The biofilm and planktonic secretomes were analyzed for their functional network associations by using STRING. Three function-based groups were identified, carbohydrate metabolism, ribosomal proteins and a third network comprising of virulence factors and chaperones. Key enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism, glutamate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase were part of the network. Predicted virulence factors that also function as molecular chaperones, such as thioredoxin, DnaK, dps and GroEL formed a distinct network. Several years ago, the ability of P. intermedia DnaK to function as a molecular chaperone was assessed by a luciferase folding assay. In periodontitis, stresses such as temperature and pH increase, increased flow of gingival crevicular fluid, and oxidative stress resulting from phagocytic cells. In response to these stresses, P. intermedia may show increased expression of heat-shock proteins such as DnaK. This may contribute to enhanced virulence of the species as well as its survival in stress conditions. In a study that investigated the effect of oxidative stress on P. intermedia protein exopression, several proteins from the above functional networks, including fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase, reductases, ribosomal proteins and molecular chaperones like thioredoxin, DnaK were upregulated when bacteria were exposed to molecular oxygen. The significance of the secretion of these proteins may possibly be related to the ability of P. intermedia to travel beyond the oral cavity and colonize distant body sites where the species must adapt to oxygenated tissues. P. intermedia has been considered a major periodontal pathogen because of its established role in initiation and development of periodontitis by inducing a variety of proinflammatory cytokines, proteases, and matrix metalloproteinases. Important cytokines such as IL-8, IL1-\u03b2, and macrophage inflammatory proteins were induced by the biofilm secretome. P. intermedia and its components have been shown to induce IL-8, IL1-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and MMPs. The role of these and other proinflammatory cytokines such as MIP-\u03b1 and MIP-\u03b2 in periodontitis has been well established. Importantly, certain bacteria-secreted proteins stimulate cytokines only in their secreted-form, not when they are within the bacterial cell. This type of specificity may suggest possible roles of P. intermedia secretome proteins beyond the oral cavity. In conclusion, the current proteomics data on the biofilm- and planktonic- secretomes may provide new insights into virulence mechanisms of P. intermedia. For example, the role\/potential of the predicted virulence factors in the secretomes may be studied by overexpressing the respective genes in a suitable system, and by constructing specific knockout mutants for further studies using in vitro and\/or in vivo models."}]},{"title":"Characterization of substrate specificity and novel autoprocessing mechanism of dipeptidase A from Prevotella intermedia","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Prevotella intermedia is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"197-4-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":26,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Prevotella intermedia normally exist?","id":"197-4-1-2","answers":[{"text":"subgingival polymicrobial biofilms from adults with chronic periodontitis","answer_start":81,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Prevotella intermedia cause?","id":"197-4-1-3","answers":[{"text":"chronic periodontitis","answer_start":133,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Prevotella intermedia's requirement for oxygen?","id":"197-4-1-4","answers":[{"text":"anaerobic","answer_start":40,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of Prevotella intermedia?","id":"197-4-1-5","answers":[{"text":"rod","answer_start":50,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Prevotella intermedia, a Gram-negative anaerobic rod, is frequently observed in subgingival polymicrobial biofilms from adults with chronic periodontitis.

BAU17746 (locus tag, PIOMA14_I_1238) and BAU18827 (locus tag, PIOMA14_II_0322) emerged as candidates of this peptidase from the substrate specificity and sequence similarity with C69-family Streptococcus gordonii Arg-aminopeptidase.

It was found that BAU17746 as well as L. helveticus dipeptidase A was a P1-position Arg-specific dipeptidase A, although the L. helveticus entity, a representative of the C69 family, had been reported to be specific for Leu and Phe. The full-length form of BAU17746 was intramolecularly processed to a mature form carrying the N-terminus of Cys15.

Bacteria of the \u2018orange complex\u2019, including Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, appeared to be more closely related to red complex members than other color-coded (yellow, green, or purple) bacterial complexes []. The virulence factors of the red complex have been studied in detail. In particular, the role of P. gingivalis acting as a keystone pathogen has been well established []. With advances in microbiome research applying next-generation sequencing technology, numerous additional disease-associated species were identified. This has been the basis for the concept of \u2018polymicrobial synergy and dysbiosis\u2019, where synergistic activities of the whole community triggered by keystone pathogens disrupt host immune defenses and cause tissue destruction []. Currently, taxonomic characterization of the human microbiome (including oral microbiome) is often limited to the species-level []. However, significant genomic and phenotypic variations at the strain-level within a species are common. Inter-strain variations have been well studied especially in terms of pathogenicity. For instances, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis include both pathogenic and commensal strains []. Similarly, not all P. gingivalis strains are equally pathogenic and genetic variations exist within the species for many important virulence factors []. Many researchers have endeavored to find specific virulence alleles involved in disease and generally have focused on fimbriae, which are filamentous components on the cell surface playing an important role in initiation as well as progression of periodontitis []. P. gingivalis has been classified into six types based on nucleotide sequences of fimA encoding fimbrillin (FimA), a subunit protein of fimbriae []. The most frequently detected genotype in healthy individuals is fimA type I, while Ib, II, and IV are more associated with periodontal disease []. In particular, the fimA type II allele seems to increase binding affinity for epithelial cell receptors contributing to enhanced virulence []. Such diversity of the microbial world clearly shows how insufficient it is to define the relationship between human microbiome and host health at species- or higher-level phylogeny. Our current work focuses on P. intermedia species, a Gram-negative anaerobic rod-shaped bacterium which is a member of the orange complex. It is known that bacterial loads of P. intermedia and P. gingivalis in dental biofilm are strongly associated with each other and their co-colonization is connected to an increase in probing depth []. P. intermedia 17 (Pi17) initially isolated from a chronic periodontitis lesion [] is the most studied strain along with type strain P. intermedia ATCC 25611 (Pi25611). It has been reported that Pi17 produces a viscous exopolysaccharide (EPS), composed mainly of mannose, and induces more severe abscesses in mice than non-EPS-producing Pi25611 []. Moreover, P17 has been known to be rarely internalized by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. This may suggest that EPS is a key component contributing to the virulence of Pi17 []. On the other hand, P. intermedia is also commonly detected in a healthy sulcus [], an environment very different from a diseased periodontal pocket. The ability of P. intermedia to colonize such distinct niches may reflect inter-strain genetic diversity and elaborate mechanisms for within-host adaptation.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the difference of wild-type P. intermedia strains focusing on virulence-associated phenotypes and genomic sequences.

In recent years, the involvement of the bacterium in respiratory tract infections as well as in oral infections has been revealed. P. intermedia possesses several potent virulence factors, such as cysteine proteinase interpain A encoded by the inpA gene. The genome of P. intermedia carries genes of the type IX secretion system (T9SS), which enables the translocation of virulence factors across the outer membrane in several pathogens belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes; however, it is still unclear whether the T9SS is functional in this microorganism. Recently, we performed targeted mutagenesis in the strain OMA14 of P. intermedia. Here, we successfully obtained mutants deficient in inpA and the T9SS component genes porK and porT. None of the mutants exhibited protease activity of interpain A. The porK and porT mutants, but not the inpA mutant, showed defects in colony pigmentation, hemagglutination, and biofilm formation. We also obtained a complemented strain for the porK gene that recovered all the above abilities. These results indicate that T9SS functions in P. intermedia and that interpain A is one of the T9SS cargo proteins. IMPORTANCE The virulence factors of periodontal pathogens such as Prevotella intermedia have not been elucidated. Using our established procedure, we succeeded in generating type IX secretion system mutants and gene complementation strains that might transfer virulence factors to the bacterial surface. The generated strains clearly indicate that T9SS in P. intermedia is essential for colonial pigmentation, hemagglutination, and biofilm formation.

The role of P. loescheii in this mixed-infection is indisputable given the fact that it grew in both wound and blood cultures [2]. We speculate that perineal and colonic flora contaminated and subsequently infected the above-described decubitus ulcer. The oxygen deficient environment of the decubitus wound coupled with extensive tissue necrosis created the perfect environment for this anaerobic bacterium to grow and thrive. Bedside surgical debridement allowed P. loescheii to invade the blood stream causing bacteremia and severe sepsis. Prevotella spp. are non-motile, Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli. They are usually isolated from the mucosal surfaces of the mouth, colon and vagina in otherwise healthy individuals [5-8]. This anaerobe is considered an opportunistic pathogen [7]. To date, more than 50 species of Prevotella have been identified [9]. They have been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal infections with potential spread to adjacent structures [4,10-13]. Recently, however, there have been a number of cases in which Prevotella spp. caused infections at a distance from their primary source [14,15]. Like all anaerobes, isolation of Prevotella spp. is difficult and requires appropriate methods for sample collection, transportation and culture. In vitro susceptibility testing of anaerobes is not performed routinely in many hospitals\u2019 clinical labs, including our hospital\u2019s microbiology lab. Hence, treatment of these infections is largely empiric and relies on reported susceptibilities from large medical centers and reference labs [16]. Of note, resistance among anaerobes has been rising; a number of studies have demonstrated increasing resistance among Prevotella spp. against \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and some have shown emergence of partial resistance to metronidazole as well [12,17-21]. Literature search revealed five reported cases of P. loescheii infection outside the oral cavity [12,14,15]. The salient features of cases reported in English language including the one at hand are summarized in Table 1. There was a case of poly-microbial brain abscess in a child reported in Japanese and a case of mixed infection in a foot ulcer reported in French from Djibouti [22].

It is often isolated from plants, fruits, soil, and water environments, such as rivers, lakes, and swimming pools. In particular circumstances, P. aeruginosa may be a significant pathogenic factor of severe and often opportunistic infections in humans. It typically infects airways and urinary tracts, causes blood infections, and is the most common cause of burn injury infections, hot-tub dermatitis, and outer ear infections (known as swimmer\u2019s ear). P. aeruginosa is the most frequent colonizer of medical devices (catheters, nebulizers, humidifiers) and is one of the pathogens that cause nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, and sepsis (Bassetti et al. 2018). Treatment of P. aeruginosa infections can be difficult due to its natural and acquired resistance to antibiotics (Breidenstein et al. 2011). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common organisms isolated from the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients (Bendiak and Ratjen 2009). The occurrence of the infection increases with age and can reach 80% in adults (Behrends et al. 2013). Several studies have shown that this infection leads to higher rates of pulmonary exacerbation and hospitalization in addition to more rapid disease progression, which leads to irreversible and destructive changes in the respiratory system and as a consequence, to chronic respiratory failure. It is also associated with more frequent cystic fibrosis complications, such as malnutrition or diabetes (Emerson et al. 2002; Kosorok et al. 2003; Nixon et al. 2001). A characteristic feature of the genus Pseudomonas is biofilm formation and fluorescent dyes and siderophore production (Leon 1979; Peix et al. 2018; Winstanley et al. 2016). Moreover, microorganisms belonging to this genus show a high capability of utilizing different substrates and a high tendency toward antibiotic resistance. P. aeruginosa shows significant adaptation capabilities, as in the case of the development of chronic infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). At this stage, the pathogen is practically impossible to eradicate. Research on the system biology of P. aeruginosa has been carried out for a long time at different levels of molecular organization (genome, transcriptome, and proteome), resulting in detailed information about the genomic structure. The size of the P. aeruginosa genome is around 6.5 Mbp. However, the size range for different strains is between 5.2 and 7 Mbp (Schmidt et al. 1996). There are 5021 genes with more than 70% sequence identity between different P. aeruginosa strains, and among them, around 4500 genes with > 98% identity. It is suggested that about 4000 genes are common to the majority of the P. aeruginosa strains (they are so-called \u2018core genome\u2019) (Parkins et al. 2018). The core genome is accompanied by genes that are present in a smaller number of strains. It is estimated that the complete set of genes found in different P. aeruginosa strains include between 10,000 and 40,000 genes. The arrangement of the genome may differ between strains; therefore, the identification of regions suitable for gene markers is difficult. Information about P. aeruginosa gene and protein data is available from several databases: (1) the Pseudomonas Genome Database, which now has more than 200 complete Pseudomonas genomes (Winsor et al. 2016); (2) PseudoCyc with 121 pathways and over 800 enzymatic reactions (Romero and Karp 2003); and (3) the SYSTOMONAS database for the analysis of Pseudomonas systems biology (Choi et al. 2007). The information is also available in commonly used databases, such as KEGG (Kanehisa et al. 2017), PubChem (Kim et al. 2016), and HMDB (Wishart et al. 2013). In recent years, metabolomic studies of P. aeruginosa have also been performed. The metabolome is the set of all relatively small compounds present in the cell and released to the environment. These low molecular weight compounds (<1500 Da) play different roles as substrates, intermediates, and products of metabolism (Fiehn 2002; Pearson 2007). The information about the presence and concentration of metabolites reflects the activity of metabolic pathways in the cell. Metabolomic studies usually rely on two analytical laboratory techniques for metabolite identification and quantification: (1) mass spectroscopy coupled with chromatography (C\/MS) or (2) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Metabolomic studies may help solve the scientific problems unsolved by using other approaches used in system biology, such as identification of new metabolic pathways (Patti et al. 2012). These studies can provide us with data regarding virulence factors and adaptation features of a given strain to the host environment, and thereby provide a useful prognostic tool in P. aeruginosa infections. Due to rapid culture-independent tests, diagnosis of urgent cases and also their targeted treatment can occur quickly. These types of studies may also be used in the development of new strategies regarding the prevention and treatment of infections caused by microorganisms (Xu et al. 2014). In this article, we present a summary of the recent achievements in the field of P. aeruginosa metabolomics. Metabolomic studies about P. aeruginosa strains comparison are shown in Table 1. Studies about interactions between two species of bacteria, such as quorum sensing and co-cultures, were also conducted. The individual metabolic profile of a strain depends on internal and external factors (such as genome structure and substrate availability, respectively) (Fig. 1).

P. putida rarely causes disease in humans, though serious infections and outbreaks have been reported from time to time. Some have suggested that P. putida functions as an exchange platform for antibiotic resistance genes (ARG), and thus represents a serious concern in the spread of ARGs to more pathogenic organisms within a hospital. Though poorly understood, the frequency of ARG exchange between P. putida and the more virulent Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its clinical relevance are particularly important for designing efficient infection control strategies, such as deciding whether high-risk patients colonized with a multidrug resistant but typically low pathogenic P. putida strain should be contact isolated or not. In this study, 21,373 screening samples (stool, rectal and throat swab) were examined to determine the presence of P. putida in a high-risk group of haemato-oncology patients during a 28-month period. A total of 89 P. putida group strains were isolated from 85 patients, with 41 of 89 (46.1%) strains harbouring the metallo-beta-lactamase gene bla VIM. These 41 clinical isolates, plus 18 bla VIM positive environmental P. putida isolates, and 17 bla VIM positive P. aeruginosa isolates, were characterized by whole genome sequencing (WGS). We constructed a maximum-likelihood tree to separate the 59 bla VIM positive P. putida group strains into eight distinct phylogenetic clusters. Bla VIM-1 was present in 6 clusters while bla VIM-2 was detected in 4 clusters. Five P. putida group strains contained both, bla VIM-1 and bla VIM-2 genes. In contrast, all P. aeruginosa strains belonged to a single genetic cluster and contained the same ARGs. Apart from bla VIM-2 and sul genes, no other ARGs were shared between P. aeruginosa and P. putida. Furthermore, the bla VIM-2 gene in P. aeruginosa was predicted to be only chromosomally located. These data provide evidence that no exchange of comprehensive ARG harbouring mobile genetic elements had occurred between P. aeruginosa and P. putida group strains during the study period, thus eliminating the need to implement enhanced infection control measures for high-risk patients colonized with a bla VIM positiv P. putida group strains in our clinical setting.

It harbours a broad spectrum of metabolic enzymes, allowing the species to adapt to various niches, including soil and water-associated habitats [1]. P. putida is a rare cause of infection in humans. However, there are several reports of bacteraemia, wound and eye infections, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, central venous catheter infection and soft tissue infections caused by P. putida [2\u20139]. A high proportion of P. putida bacteraemia is considered to be catheter-related, occurring predominantly in immunocompromised hosts and generally associated with a low rate of mortality [2, 10, 11]. However, lethal cases of bacteraemia and soft skin tissue infections have been described [3, 4]. While the antimicrobial resistance patterns of clinical isolates varied between studies, multidrug-resistant P. putida isolates harbouring metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (MBL) genes have been reported from all over the world [6\u20139, 12\u201319]. MBLs belong to the molecular class B \u03b2-lactamases and are characterized by requiring zinc for the catalysis of \u03b2-lactams [20]. MBLs can confer resistance to clinically important \u03b2-lactams including carbapenems which are often considered as last line of defence in critically ill patients. Aggravating the treatment limitation, the most important enzymes of this group, Verona integron-encoded metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (VIM), Imipenemase (IMP), and New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (NDM), are often co-localized with other resistance conferring genes on mobile genetic elements in P. aeruginosa [21]. Several outbreaks of P. putida occurred on ICU (intensive care units) as well as non-ICU wards, some of which were related to the transmission of contaminated fluids [22\u201325]. This underlines the ability of P. putida not only to colonize patients, but also to persist in fluids and in water-associated hospital environments [13]. The role of environmental bacteria like Pseudomonas species behaving as reservoirs and vectors of resistance determinants in hospital water systems has become a serious concern to infection control professionals. Investigations into bacteria isolated from hospital wastewater detected bla VIM MBL genes in various bacterial species [26]. It was suggested that P. putida functions as an exchange platform for genetic elements between environmental and clinical strains. This was evident in the analysis of a P. putida carbapenem resistance-conferring conjugative plasmid, which contained genetic regions of both clinical and environmental microbiota [27]. Additionally, the characterization of genetic resistance elements of eight P. putida and eleven P. aeruginosa clinical isolates suggested horizontal dissemination of bla VIM-2 in a subset of strains [28]. However, the detailed mechanisms, frequency of antimicrobial resistance exchange and relevance between P. putida and P. aeruginosa remain poorly understood. Following an outbreak of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa strains, weekly active screening cultures (ASC) were introduced for the detection of Pseudomonas species at the haemato-oncology wards in our hospital [29]. Interestingly, P. putida was frequently recovered during ASC besides P. aeruginosa. In one case, a bla VIM positive P. putida and a bla VIM positive P. aeruginosa strain were isolated from a single stool sample, suggesting that the transfer of ARGs might have occurred between the two species in the patient. The dissemination of multidrug resistance elements to successful P. aeruginosa clones represents a serious health care concern [28]. This scenario, in combination with the fact that bla VIM positive P. aeruginosa strains were continuously isolated in our patients made it difficult to establish infection control strategies for patients colonized with bla VIM positive P. putida. Systematically gathered data were not available to help us form the basis for a recommendation, a point that encouraged us to conduct this study. In order to characterize the role of P. putida group strains in transmitting determinants of antimicrobial resistance to P. aeruginosa within the patient and the patient-related environment, an observational study was conducted over a 28-month period. Our aim was to evaluate i) the frequency of colonisation with P. putida in a high-risk haemato-oncological population, ii) the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, iii) the genetic relatedness of P. putida and P. aeruginosa strains and iv) to compare genetic antibiotic resistance elements from P. putida and P. aeruginosa strains isolated from the same patient cohort and environment during the study period."}]}]},{"species":"Pseudomonas fluorescens","docs":[{"title":"Microbiology, genomics, and clinical significance of the Pseudomonas fluorescens species complex, an unappreciated colonizer of humans","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can P. fluorescens cause?","id":"212-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":732,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Pseudomonas fluorescens is not generally considered a bacterial pathogen in humans; however, multiple culture-based and culture-independent studies have identified it at low levels in the indigenous microbiota of various body sites.

One interesting feature is that a number of these studies have identified the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens as a low-abundance member of the indigenous microbiota of various body sites, including the mouth, stomach, and lungs (1,\u20135). P. fluorescens has generally been considered nonpathogenic for humans, an assessment dating back to its earliest descriptions, by A. Baader and C. Garre, in \u00dcber Antagonisten unter den Bacterien (1887) (6):  The bacillus [P. fluorescens] itself is not pathogenic. A culture applied to animals subcutaneously or injected into the peritoneum does not elicit a reaction. Even when introduced many times into fresh wounds it does not irritate healing by primary intention. Also, ingestion of cultures caused no harm to my stomach or intestines.   However, while far less virulent than P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens can cause acute infections (opportunistic) in humans and has been reported in clinical samples from the mouth, stomach, and lungs (Table 1). The most common site of P. fluorescens infection is the bloodstream. Most reported cases have been iatrogenic, with bacteremia attributable either to transfusion of contaminated blood products (7,\u201312) or to use of contaminated equipment associated with intravenous infusions (13,\u201317). While not suspected of being an etiologic agent of pulmonary disease, we recently reported that P. fluorescens is routinely cultured at a low frequency from clinically indicated respiratory samples (3) (Table 2). Perhaps the most intriguing \u201cassociation\u201d between P. fluorescens and human disease is that approximately 50% of Crohn's disease patients develop serum antibodies to the I2 antigen encoded by P. fluorescens, and in some studies, this seroreactivity has correlated with the success of therapies aimed at the microbiome rather than the immune system (18,\u201322). Altogether, these reports and others are beginning to highlight a far more common, and potentially complex, interaction between humans and P. fluorescens during health and disease. Reported P. fluorescens infections P. fluorescens isolates cultured over an 11-year period by the University of Michigan Hospital Microbiology Lab The extremely versatile metabolic capabilities of P. fluorescens impart this bacterium with the ability to persist in a wide range of environments beyond mammalian hosts (Fig. 1), including soil, the rhizospheres and surfaces of plants, nonsterile pharmaceuticals, showerheads, and even indoor wall surfaces (23, 24). P. fluorescens has been studied most widely as an environmental microbe, most notably for its role in promoting plant health via a number of encoded antimicrobial mechanisms (25,\u201338). However, P. fluorescens also possesses a number of functional traits that provide it with the capability to grow and thrive in mammalian hosts, including production of bioactive secondary metabolites (26,\u201330, 33, 39,\u201342), siderophores (43,\u201345), and a type III secretion system (46,\u201351), the ability to form biofilms (20, 52,\u201356), and the plasticity of some strains to adapt to growth at higher temperature (53, 57,\u201359).

There are at least 52 species within this group (Fig. 2), and they share many phenotypic characteristics (Fig. 3). Since the taxonomic reclassifications within P. fluorescens are relatively new and ongoing, and beyond the scope of this review, we use the term \u201cP. fluorescens species complex,\u201d or simply \u201cP. fluorescens,\u201d in this review for studies on any isolates within this Pseudomonas species complex (Fig. 2).

P. fluorescens was cultured from the biopsy lung tissue of this patient. Based on the AST results of P. fluorescens, the condition of this patient improved in response to ciprofloxacin therapy. In previous studies of P. fluorescens, the clinical samples included sputum, BALF or throat swabs. In contrast to previous reports, we report P. fluorescens cultured from lung biopsy specimens for the first time. The roles of P. fluorescens in pneumonia or other respiratory diseases pathogenesis are undefined. The clinical features of P. fluorescens-associated pneumonia have rarely been reported [25]. In the case of a myasthenic patient [25], during recovery from a recent polymicrobial peritonitis, he developed clinical evidence of pneumonia, with sputum cultures that were positive for P. fluorescens. Prior to the pneumonia, this 55-year-old patient received the treatment with intravenous cefuroxime and metronidazole, and mechanical ventilation. The P. fluorescens was sensitive to amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, latamoxef and ceftazidime. He recovered after the therapy of metronidazole supplemented with intravenous ceftazidime. P. fluorescens was also mentioned in the aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia in a single case, and the P. fluorescens did not respond to therapy with ceftriaxone, but the clinical details were lacking [26]. In most previous studies, it is unclear whether the positive sputum or BALF culture results reflected acute infection or benign colonization of patients. Using amplification of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, P. fluorescens and other bacteria was detected in the BALF acquired from a single patient with VAP [19]. In another study of over 1,000 respiratory cultures acquired from patients with CF, the authors identified P. fluorescens in approximately 2% of samples and considered the organism a colonizer rather than an acute pathogen [22]. P. fluorescens was also identified in a single patient with CF and new lower airways infection [20]. In a survey of lung transplant recipients, P. fluorescens was frequently identified in BALF samples of asymptomatic recipients by pyrosequencing, but not detected via standard bacterial culture [18]. In their survey [18], researchers also searched the database of bacterial culture isolates from the University of Michigan Clinical Microbiology Laboratory. Over an 11-year period, P. fluorescens was cultured from over 240 distinct respiratory specimens, including sputum, throat swabs, and bronchoscopically-obtained specimens (BALF or brushings). Among patients with positive P. fluorescens respiratory cultures, the most common underlying pulmonary condition was CF (38.8% of all isolates), followed by other chronic airway diseases (COPD, asthma, and non-CF bronchiectasis [16.1%]) and lung transplantation (7.4%). In addition, 26 of these specimens were obtained from patients with suspected acute pneumonia, and 22 of these patients were chronically immunosuppressed or had recent healthcare exposures meeting criteria for healthcare-associated pneumonia. In our report, the patient had none known risk factor for P. fluorescens colonization or infection, including ventilator usage, lung transplantation, CF, immunosuppression, or other chronic airway diseases. However, it is worth noting that this eldly patient was thin and had low albumin level, with a smoking history of more than 20 years. And he received the treatment with multiple antibiotics before lung biopsy. The patient presented with a fever and radiographic lung infiltrate. Laboratory examinations revealed elevated WBC and NEU counts. He was in poor nutritional status, with difficulties in sputum excretion, making him at high risk for bronchoscopy. Therefore, the CT-guided lung puncture biopsy was performed for diagnosis. P. fluorescens was cultured from lung biopsy specimens. The clinical symptoms, CT and laboratory test results, pathologic findings, and treatment response to ciprofloxacin provide evidence of P. fluorescens infection in our case. The pathohistological diagnosis of the biopsy provided meaning guidance for a clinical diagnosis, including the exclusion of tumours, granulomatous diseases, TB infection, fungal infection, etc. However, pathological observation cannot identify the type of bacterial pathogens. More importantly, the results of tissue culture and drug sensitivity tests played an important role in guiding the use of antibiotics to treat this patient. In the AST, P. fluorescens was resistant to multiple antibiotics, which may be the reason for the poor efficacy of initial empirical therapy. Notably, the antimicrobial susceptibility results of our P. fluorescens isolates were in agreement with known findings as described above [25, 26]. They were resistant to ceftriaxone, and sensitive to amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ceftazidime and piperacillin. However, the previous studies relating antimicrobial susceptibility characteristics were early and few, the coverage of antibiotics was relatively narrow. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of P. fluorescens pneumonia need to be further summarized and clarified. In summary, P. fluorescens can cause acute pneumonia, with fever as the main clinical symptom. When encountering patients with pneumonia presenting with poor efficacy of empiric antibiotic treatment, we should consider the possibility of P. fluorescens infection. In addition, it is important to perform the bacterial culture and AST in a timely manner. Antibiotic therapy under the guidance of the P. fluorescens antimicrobial spectrum is significant for such patients. However, more research is needed to study the pathogenesis of P. fluorescens and to establish diagnostic criteria and effective treatment of these cases."}]}]},{"species":"Pseudomonas mendocina","docs":[{"title":"Pseudomonas mendocina, an environmental bacterium isolated from a patient with human infective endocarditis","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Where does Pseudomonas mendocina normally exist?","id":"213-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"soil and water samples","answer_start":46,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Pseudomonas mendocina cause?","id":"213-1-1-2","answers":[{"text":"endocarditis","answer_start":218,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Pseudomonas mendocina has been isolated from soil and water samples.

An 81-year-old Caucasian male presented with bilateral lower leg erythema and drainage but was afebrile. His past medical history included atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure. Labs showed leukocytosis and a blood culture was obtained revealing Pseudomonas mendocina. The pathogen was susceptible to all antibiotics tested and he was successfully treated on cefepime inpatient and a two-week course of ciprofloxacin on discharge. Our case and literature review presents a successful treatment of a rare cause of bacteremia likely stemming from a soft tissue nidus. P. mendocina has a favorable susceptibility profile and the antibiotics preferred differ from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a more common pathogen.

As shown in Table 2, this case is the second reported case in the USA and overall the fourteenth reported case of human P. mendocina infection. P. mendocina has a ubiquitous nature which is supported by the large geographic spread of the case reports. Of the 13 reported cases, 6 were reported from Asia (Taiwan [2,3], Singapore [4]), 3 cases were reported from Europe (Portugal [5], Denmark [6], France [7]), 2 cases were reported from the Middle East (Turkey [8], Israel [9]), 1 case was reported from North America (USA [10]), and 1 case was reported from South America (Argentina [11]).

P. mendocina human infections appear to have a slow, insidious onset. Many of the reported patient symptoms included fever, malaise, and shivering days before presentation to the hospital. Positive markers of inflammation were present in several cases including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), estimated sedimentation rate (ESR), and leukocytosis. Elevated CRP levels ranged from 16 to 233.6 mg\/L [4,5,9\u201311]. Elevated ESR ranged from 33 to 105 mm\/hr [4,5,9\u201311]. Elevated white blood cell counts ranged from 14.7\u201324 g\/L [8,10,11].

No sources of P. mendocina infections were confirmed in any of the case reports. In 3 case reports, a source of infection was suspected. In a case report by Johansen et al., the authors suspected that P. mendocina was introduced during one of the patient\u2019s 3 previous cardiac operations [6]. In a case report by Aragone et al., the authors suspected that bacteria entered the bloodstream through thorn pricks and handling of damp earth in view of the patient\u2019s occupation as a florist; the patient presented with small erythematous lesions on the fingertips of both hands attributed to thorn pricks [7]. In the peculiar case reported by Nseir et al., the patient \u201creported that he had a new pet cockatiel that he fed and watered directly from his mouth\u201d. Based on this information, cultures of the bird\u2019s bottled drinking water were taken and P. mendocina was cultured from the bird\u2019s drinking water [9]. Favorable outcomes were described in all case reports and no mortality from P. mendocina infection was reported. In cases that reported fevers, patients quickly became afebrile within 24 to 48 hours of antimicrobial therapy initiation. Most P. mendocina infection case reports were monomicrobial infections except for 3 cases of polymicrobial infection [2,11]. In the 3 cases of polymicrobial infection, the other pathogens were also Gram-negative bacteria (Table 2). P. mendocina infections were successfully treated with a wide variety of antibiotics including penicillins, early and later-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (Table 3). Treatment of P. mendocina was successful with non-traditional P. aeruginosa antibiotics such as ampicillin and early-generation cephalosporins. The susceptibility of P. mendocina to a broader range of antibiotics than that of P. aeruginosa might be attributed to its rare occurrence in human infections. Since P. mendocina is not a common clinical human pathogen, there is not much data available about its patterns of susceptibilities and resistance. Available susceptibilities, resistance, and a few reported minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) from the 14 case reports are displayed in Tables 4 and \u200band5.5. As mentioned, P. mendocina is susceptible to non-traditional anti-pseudomonal antibiotics. Several cases reported susceptibility to all antibiotics tested (including aminoglycosides, carbapenems, ampicillin, later-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and piperacillin\/tazobactam) [2,5,6]. Although non-pseudomonal antibiotics, such as ampicillin, cefazolin, and sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim, were used, there have been some reports of resistance to these drugs. Chi et al. reported resistance to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim [4]. Aragone et al. reported resistance to ampicillin and cephalothin [7]. Rapsinski et al. reported resistance to ampicillin\/sulbactam and cefazolin [8]. Nseir et al. reported resistance to aztreonam and ceftriaxone [9]. Chiu et al. reported resistance to ampicillin and ampicillin\/sulbactam [11]. All documented case reports of P. mendocina infection resulted in successful treatment with antibiotics and survival of the patient (Table 3). Antibiotic treatment regimens and survival.

P. levii is an anaerobic, pigmented gram-negative bacillus originally isolated from bovine rumen. Recently, P. levii was found to cause an outbreak of bovine necrotizing vulvovaginitis and the authors concluded that P. levii as an etiologic agent of bovine necrotizing vulvovaginitis may be underdiagnosed (6). P. levii-like organisms have been described from human sources, such as the vagina (8), from patients with chronic otitis media (9), and a case of bacterial vaginosis (1). We previously described B. levii-like organisms isolated from various human clinical specimens (14). These strains were biochemically characterized as part of a comprehensive reevaluation of pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods (5). The strains were phenotypically similar to the type strain of P. levii from bovine rumen (ATCC 29147) and therefore are referred to as P. levii-like organisms (PLLO). The PLLO isolated from human sources are phenotypically similar to other human Porphyromonas species in that they produce pigmented colonies on blood agar and are susceptible to the special-potency vancomycin disk. Unlike other human Porphyromonas species, however, PLLO are weakly saccharolytic and indole negative. Because of this, the identification of PLLO in the clinical laboratories has been problematic; they may have been misidentified as pigmented Prevotella species or reported as unusual, pigmented gram-negative rods. Therefore, the clinical importance of PLLO maybe underestimated due to the lack of a sound classification and identification scheme. The 16S rRNA gene is the most widely accepted gene used for bacterial classification and identification (23). Signature nucleotides of 16S rRNA genes allow classification even if a particular sequence has no match in the database, since otherwise unrecognizable isolates can be assigned to phylogenetic branches at the class, family, genus, or subgenus levels. This has contributed greatly to the taxonomy of anaerobic bacteria. The aim of this study was to characterize the PLLO isolated from humans, determine its taxonomic position compared to other Porphyromonas species, and document the need for a new species to encompass it. We also describe the types of infections involving PLLO and the phenotypic tests useful in distinguishing it from other Porphyromonas species. Part of the biochemical characterization and clinical information has been presented previously (5, 14)."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where does P. levii normally exist?","id":"214-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"bovine rumen","answer_start":4086,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"P. levii was originally included in the genus Bacteroides, but biochemical and 16S rRNA sequence studies indicated that it belongs in the genus Porphyromonas (19). A 98% 16S rRNA sequence similarity is generally accepted as an indication of the same species (20), and in DN\u0391-DNA hybridization studies, a threshold of 70% or greater similarity indicates relationship at the species level (22). In our study, the PLLO strains were genetically highly related to each other at >99% sequence similarity but not related to P. levii ATCC 29147 (94% similarity). Similarly, the DN\u0391-DNA reassociation studies showed a low-level affinity between PLLO and P. levii ATCC 29147 (44 to 53% similarity), indicating that they do not belong to the same species. The 16S rRNA sequence similarity and DN\u0391-DNA hybridization results were consistent with the PLLO belonging to the Porphyromonas genus, which was also supported by the biochemical data. Our biochemical characterization of PLLO showed that it was phenotypically similar to P. levii (19). The PLLO produced pigmented colonies on blood agar and were sensitive to the special-potency vancomycin disk and produced complex metabolic end product profiles that included acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, and isovaleric acids; the major cellular fatty acid was iso-C15:0, similar to the Porphyromonas genus (10, 19). A satellite-like growth pattern, negative indole and \u03b1-fucosidase, and positive N-acetyl-\u03b2-glucosaminidase were the key characteristics in differentiating PLLO from other Porphyromonas species (Table \u200b(Table1).1). Unlike most other human Porphyromonas species, PLLO was weakly saccharolytic; however, it was easily differentiated from the saccharolytic pigmented Prevotella species by biochemical tests and sensitivity to the special-potency vancomycin disk (Table \u200b(Table1).1). Demonstration of pigment production by PLLO was useful in differentiating it from Porphyromonas catoniae, which is also indole negative and weakly saccharolytic but nonpigmented. Human PLLO were genetically distant from P. levii; however, using phenotypic tests these two organisms could only be differentiated by cluster analysis of the cellular fatty acid profiles (Euclidian distance of principal components accounting for the greatest variance of the organisms). P. levii clustered distantly (>15) from the PLLO strains. Due to the negative indole reaction and weakly saccharolytic nature of PLLO, it may have commonly been misidentified as Prevotella species or another gram-negative rod in clinical laboratories. Using an accurate identification scheme, it may be found to be more common in clinical specimens than has been appreciated. After we became more aware of the PLLO group during our study of comprehensive biochemical reevaluation of pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods (5), we isolated PLLO more frequently; 17 specimens yielded PLLO between 1981 and 1992, whereas PLLO was isolated from 36 specimens between 1993 and 2003. Even though P. levii-like organisms were isolated from vaginosis and chronic otitis media (1, 8, 9), we found that PLLO was predominantly isolated from patients with chronic skin and soft tissue or bone infections in the lower extremities (70%) or the inguinal\/sacral area (10%). The most common predisposing condition in the patients with skin and soft tissue or bone infections was diabetes mellitus. This distribution of types of infection may be related to our patient population and the association with diabetes mellitus. There were several serious infections in which PLLOs were part of the infecting flora. The full extent of the virulence of PLLO remains to be determined, as it was always isolated in mixed culture with accompanying organisms indicative of colonic flora. However, it is notable that 21% of the PLLO strains were \u03b2-lactamase producers, a trait among Porphyromonas species shared only with the recently described Porphyromonas uenonis (7). Our studies indicate that the human PLLO are phenotypically similar, but genetically different, from the P. levii type strain isolated from bovine rumen. We therefore propose the name Porphyromonas somerae to encompass the human P. levii-like organisms.  Porphyromonas somerae (so\u2032mer.ae, N.L. gen. n. somerae, of Somer, in honor of the late Finnish microbiologist Hannele Jousimies-Somer, who has contributed significantly to our knowledge of pigmented anaerobic gram-negative rods and to the identification of clinically important anaerobic bacteria in general) is a gram-negative, obligately anaerobic, nonsporeforming, nonmotile rod. Colonies incubated on blood agar for 2 days often exhibit a \u201cpatchy\u201d growth pattern, with larger colonies surrounded by smaller colonies; they are circular, entire, and convex. The colonies on laked rabbit blood agar are white-yellow to tan; after 4 days of incubation, the colonies are pigmented (light brown to dark brown) and show no or occasionally weak red fluorescence under long-wave UV light. The organisms are indole, nitrate, lipase, and catalase negative. They are weakly saccharolytic, and the pH of glucose, lactose, and maltose cultures is 5.3 to 5.4 after 5 days of incubation. Major fermentation products from PYG metabolism are acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, and isovaleric acids. The major cellular fatty acids are iso-C15:0 and anteiso-C15:0. Organisms are negative for lipase, cystine arylaminidase, \u03b1-fucosidase, \u03b1-galactosidase, \u03b2-glucuronidase, \u03b2-glucosidase, \u03b1-mannosidase, \u03b2-xylosidase, esculin, and trypsin; positive for alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, naphthol-AS-Bl-phosphohydrolase, N-acetyl-\u03b2-glucosaminidase, \u03b2-galactosidase, and chymotrypsin; and variable for esterase, esterase lipase, leucine arylamidase; valine arylamidase, and \u03b1-glucosidase activities by the API ZYM system. They are negative for \u03b1-fucosidase, \u03b2-xylosidase, trypsin, and esculin and positive for N-acetyl-\u03b2-glucosaminidase and ONPG (o-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside) in the Rosco diagnostic tablets system. \u03b2-Lactamase is produced by 21% of the strains.

A 98% 16S rRNA sequence similarity is generally accepted as an indication of the same species (20), and in DN\u0391-DNA hybridization studies, a threshold of 70% or greater similarity indicates relationship at the species level (22). In our study, the PLLO strains were genetically highly related to each other at >99% sequence similarity but not related to P. levii ATCC 29147 (94% similarity). Similarly, the DN\u0391-DNA reassociation studies showed a low-level affinity between PLLO and P. levii ATCC 29147 (44 to 53% similarity), indicating that they do not belong to the same species. The 16S rRNA sequence similarity and DN\u0391-DNA hybridization results were consistent with the PLLO belonging to the Porphyromonas genus, which was also supported by the biochemical data. Our biochemical characterization of PLLO showed that it was phenotypically similar to P. levii (19). The PLLO produced pigmented colonies on blood agar and were sensitive to the special-potency vancomycin disk and produced complex metabolic end product profiles that included acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, and isovaleric acids; the major cellular fatty acid was iso-C15:0, similar to the Porphyromonas genus (10, 19). A satellite-like growth pattern, negative indole and \u03b1-fucosidase, and positive N-acetyl-\u03b2-glucosaminidase were the key characteristics in differentiating PLLO from other Porphyromonas species (Table \u200b(Table1).1). Unlike most other human Porphyromonas species, PLLO was weakly saccharolytic; however, it was easily differentiated from the saccharolytic pigmented Prevotella species by biochemical tests and sensitivity to the special-potency vancomycin disk (Table \u200b(Table1).1). Demonstration of pigment production by PLLO was useful in differentiating it from Porphyromonas catoniae, which is also indole negative and weakly saccharolytic but nonpigmented. Human PLLO were genetically distant from P. levii; however, using phenotypic tests these two organisms could only be differentiated by cluster analysis of the cellular fatty acid profiles (Euclidian distance of principal components accounting for the greatest variance of the organisms). P. levii clustered distantly (>15) from the PLLO strains. Due to the negative indole reaction and weakly saccharolytic nature of PLLO, it may have commonly been misidentified as Prevotella species or another gram-negative rod in clinical laboratories. Using an accurate identification scheme, it may be found to be more common in clinical specimens than has been appreciated. After we became more aware of the PLLO group during our study of comprehensive biochemical reevaluation of pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods (5), we isolated PLLO more frequently; 17 specimens yielded PLLO between 1981 and 1992, whereas PLLO was isolated from 36 specimens between 1993 and 2003. Even though P. levii-like organisms were isolated from vaginosis and chronic otitis media (1, 8, 9), we found that PLLO was predominantly isolated from patients with chronic skin and soft tissue or bone infections in the lower extremities (70%) or the inguinal\/sacral area (10%). The most common predisposing condition in the patients with skin and soft tissue or bone infections was diabetes mellitus. This distribution of types of infection may be related to our patient population and the association with diabetes mellitus. There were several serious infections in which PLLOs were part of the infecting flora. The full extent of the virulence of PLLO remains to be determined, as it was always isolated in mixed culture with accompanying organisms indicative of colonic flora. However, it is notable that 21% of the PLLO strains were \u03b2-lactamase producers, a trait among Porphyromonas species shared only with the recently described Porphyromonas uenonis (7). Our studies indicate that the human PLLO are phenotypically similar, but genetically different, from the P. levii type strain isolated from bovine rumen. We therefore propose the name Porphyromonas somerae to encompass the human P. levii-like organisms.  Porphyromonas somerae (so\u2032mer.ae, N.L. gen. n. somerae, of Somer, in honor of the late Finnish microbiologist Hannele Jousimies-Somer, who has contributed significantly to our knowledge of pigmented anaerobic gram-negative rods and to the identification of clinically important anaerobic bacteria in general) is a gram-negative, obligately anaerobic, nonsporeforming, nonmotile rod. Colonies incubated on blood agar for 2 days often exhibit a \u201cpatchy\u201d growth pattern, with larger colonies surrounded by smaller colonies; they are circular, entire, and convex. The colonies on laked rabbit blood agar are white-yellow to tan; after 4 days of incubation, the colonies are pigmented (light brown to dark brown) and show no or occasionally weak red fluorescence under long-wave UV light. The organisms are indole, nitrate, lipase, and catalase negative. They are weakly saccharolytic, and the pH of glucose, lactose, and maltose cultures is 5.3 to 5.4 after 5 days of incubation. Major fermentation products from PYG metabolism are acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, and isovaleric acids. The major cellular fatty acids are iso-C15:0 and anteiso-C15:0. Organisms are negative for lipase, cystine arylaminidase, \u03b1-fucosidase, \u03b1-galactosidase, \u03b2-glucuronidase, \u03b2-glucosidase, \u03b1-mannosidase, \u03b2-xylosidase, esculin, and trypsin; positive for alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, naphthol-AS-Bl-phosphohydrolase, N-acetyl-\u03b2-glucosaminidase, \u03b2-galactosidase, and chymotrypsin; and variable for esterase, esterase lipase, leucine arylamidase; valine arylamidase, and \u03b1-glucosidase activities by the API ZYM system. They are negative for \u03b1-fucosidase, \u03b2-xylosidase, trypsin, and esculin and positive for N-acetyl-\u03b2-glucosaminidase and ONPG (o-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside) in the Rosco diagnostic tablets system. \u03b2-Lactamase is produced by 21% of the strains. Some strains are resistant to amoxicillin and to clindamycin.

A more detailed description of this syndrome was given by Andre Lemierre in 1938 [9]. Lemierre described this new disease entity as \u201cthe appearance and repletion several days after the onset of a sore throat (and particularly of a tonsillar abscess) of several pyrexial attacks with an initial rigor, or still more certainly the occurrence of pulmonary infarcts and arthritic manifestations, constitute a syndrome so characteristic that mistake is almost impossible.\u201d There have been variations in the definition of this syndrome with some authors only considering disseminated F. necrophorum infections arising from the throat. Others have included oropharyngeal infections with metastatic spread to other organs, irrespective of foci of origin. In a recent prospective study from Denmark, the incidence of Lemierre's syndrome was found to be 3.6 cases per million inhabitants, contrary to previous estimates of only 1 case per million inhabitants based on retrospective studies [4, 10]. In the same study, the incidence in the age group of 15\u201324 was found to be 14.4 cases per million per year. It was rarely found in adults over 40 years of age. Slight seasonal accumulation was found with cases being more accumulated during late winter and early spring [10]. Presentation, epidemiology, and the natural history of this disease entity appear to have drastically changed over the years. Changes in patterns of antibiotic availability and usage along with the availability of better diagnostic testing have led to changes in trends of this disease. An increase in cases of this syndrome after 1980s has been attributed to a decreased trend of prescribing empiric antibiotics for sore throat, as well as the use of macrolide antibiotics which have no susceptibility to oral anaerobes. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use and increasing antibiotic resistance especially to \u03b2 lactams, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), and other viral infections have all been described and proposed as possible reasons for increased number of cases [11\u201313]. On the other hand, there have been a number of studies disputing this fact, considering that the \u201creemergence\u201d is just from improved diagnostic testing and blood cultures. The most common microorganism associated with Lemierre's syndrome is Fusobacterium necrophorum [2]. Analysis of published cases from 1970 to 2007 done by Riordan showed that 86% of the total cases of Lemierre's syndrome had shown growth of F. necrophorum or another Fusobacterium sp. [13]. Some other microorganisms associated with Lemierre's syndrome include Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Eikenella corrodens, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, and Bacteroides. Isolation of microorganisms can be from blood or sites of metastatic infections. It is not uncommon to have negative or mixed growth on culture with this syndrome [13].  P. asaccharolytica is a rare etiological agent of Lemierre's syndrome. Prior to 1988, Porphyromonas was considered to be a subspecies of Bacteroides melaninogenicus. Classification of Bacteroides species was revised, and a new genus of Porphyromonas was proposed to include pigmented species without saccharolytic activity [6, 14]. P. asaccharolytica is a black-pigmented Gram-negative, obligate anaerobe that belongs to the family Bacteriodaceae. P endodontalis and P gingivalis are other members of the genus Porphyromonas present in humans [15]. P. asaccharolytica is more common in urogenital apparatus and gastrointestinal tract, while P. endodontalis and P. gingivalis are more commonly found in oral cavity [5]. To the best of our knowledge, there have been 3 other cases of Lemierre's syndrome reported in the literature in which P. asaccharolytica was the causative agent [5\u20137]. Lemierre syndrome being caused by an organism that is not usually found in oral cavity is an interesting finding. The pathophysiology of this disease is not completely known. It has been postulated that there is a preceding infection by some other organisms, likely viral which impedes the local defense and facilitates invasion into pharyngeal space. Further spread can be through hematogenous, lymphatic, or direct through fascial plains between tonsils and parapharyngeal space [11]. Once the internal jugular vein is involved, metastatic infections to other sites such as lungs, bones, or brain can occur. Pleuropulmonary complications can be present in more than 90% of cases with metastatic infections and can be in the form of septic lung emboli, lung abscess, pleural effusions, and\/or empyema in various combinations [13]. Extrapulmonary manifestations include septic arthritis, muscle abscess, osteomyelitis, liver abscess, skin abscess, cerebral abscess, meningitis, and endocarditis. Renal failure and DIC can also be present in a small subset of patients [11]. The CT scan of the neck with contrast is the investigation of choice for diagnosis of this syndrome [16]. Doppler ultrasound is less sensitive and more dependent on the skill of operator. Findings on ultrasound include noncompressible low-level echos in the affected internal jugular vein associated with venous distention and absence of flow. It can also be considered for serial assessment of the clot after initial diagnosis [12]. Antibiotic therapy should be guided based on microbial isolation from blood or other sources. Surgical drainage should be considered in all parapharyngeal, cervical, or mediastinal abscesses. Lemierre's syndrome has traditionally been treated with penicillins, clindamycin, and\/or metronidazole. \u03b2-lactamase-resistant strains have been found recently [11]. Metronidazole has good coverage for oropharyngeal anaerobes, but monotherapy is not recommended due to frequently present coinfections [17]. Patients are usually treated with a combination of beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins and metronidazole. Also, due to intraluminal spread of infection, Lemierre's syndrome is usually treated with a prolonged antibiotic course of 3 to 6 weeks, with intravenous antibiotics being preferred [3, 4]. Ligation of the internal jugular vein is historic and is rarely indicated in patients with persistent septic embolization despite antibiotics. Due to rarity of this disease, there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the role of anticoagulation in septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein. It is reserved for a specific subset of cases, in which benefits outweighs inherent risk of anticoagulation therapy. Patients with thrombus progression, as in our case, can be considered for anticoagulation therapy. Patients are usually anticoagulated with warfarin for 3 months and bridged with heparin [4]. Due to potential interaction of metronidazole with warfarin, INR needs to be monitored closely. There was a mortality exceeding 90% in the preantibiotic era from a rapidly progressive disease course [3, 4]. In more recent reviews, mortality has been reported to be around 4\u201312%, which is still considerably high [10]."}]}]},{"species":"Parvimonas micra","docs":[{"title":"Clinical characteristics of bloodstream infection by Parvimonas micra: retrospective case series and literature review","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can P. micra cause?","id":"217-1-1-1","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":925,"id":1},{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":1121,"id":2},{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":1531,"id":3},{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":2136,"id":4},{"text":"spondylodiscitis (29.6%), oropharyngeal infection (25.9%), intra-abdominal abscess (14.8%), infective endocarditis (11.1%), septic pulmonary emboli (11.1%), and GIT infection","answer_start":1574,"id":5}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Gram-positive anaerobic (GPA) bacteria inhabit different parts of the human body as commensals but can also cause bacteremia.

Gram-positive anaerobes (GPAs) are found in the commensal microbiota of the digestive tract, with some species colonizing the urogenital tract and skin. GPAs include Clostridium spp., Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC), and Gram-positive non-spore-forming anaerobes (GPNAs) [1]. As reported, Clostridium spp., GPAC, and GPNAs account for 20.7, 14.7, and 6% of all anaerobic hematic isolates, respectively [1]. Parvimonas micra (P. micra) is a member of GPAC normally found in the oral cavity, respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and the female genitourinary tract. Originally known as Peptostreptococcus micros, the organism was reclassified as P. micra in 2006 [2]. P. micra is one of the bacterial species most frequently isolated from infected root canals of teeth with chronic apical periodontitis [3]. P. micra has also been implicated in meningitis [4], cervical and brain abscess [5, 6], infective endocarditis (IE) [7], and spondylodiscitis [8].

However, P. micra have rarely been identified as causative pathogens of GPA bacteremia using conventional methods due to difficulties with the laboratory identification. In both ours and the literature cases, P. micra bacteremia cases were increasingly diagnosed after 2015 (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1)1) and were mostly detected using MALDI-TOF MS or 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Table \u200b(Table22 and sTable 1). In a recent population-based study, GPAC bacteremia, identified using MALDI-TOF MS or 16S rRNA gene sequencing, was reported to be much more common than previously reported with an annual incidence of 3.4 cases per 100,000 persons per year [9], while P. micra was the most commonly isolated in the study. Thus, these new techniques might enable accurate diagnosis of P. micra bacteremia for appropriate treatment.  Confirmed cases of P. micra bacteremia during 2010\u20132019 in our institute, and 1980\u20132019 in literature review, respectively We reviewed 25 patients with P. micra bacteremia using MALDI-TOF MS or conventional phenotypic method from 2010 to 2019. We found that oropharyngeal infections (7\/25, 28.0%) and GIT (6\/25, 24.0%) were the primary sources of P. micra bacteremia; however, the sources of bacteremia in the remaining 9 patients (36.0%) were not recorded. As the presenting symptoms in these patients were non-specific (e.g., fever, shake, and chills), thorough searches for the primary source of bacteremia may not have been carefully conducted in these 9 cases. In 27 literature cases, P. micra bacteremia were also frequently associated with oropharyngeal infection (7\/27, 25.9%) and GIT infection (3\/27, 11.1%) [14\u201331]. Other common infectious diseases of P. micra in the literature cases were spondylodiscitis (8\/27, 29.6%), intra-abdominal abscess (4\/27, 14.8%), IE (3.27, 11.1%), and septic pulmonary emboli (3\/27, 11.1%) which is inconsistent with our results. Spondylodiscitis caused by P. micra is rare but an important infectious disease, which is sometimes diagnosed from samples of the bone or vertebral disk without positive blood culture [23]. IE due to anaerobic bacteremia account for 2\u201316% of all cases of IE over the past few decades [32], and P. micra might be one of the important anaerobic pathogens causing IE. Recently, Badri and coworkers reported clinical features about 100 cases of Parvimonas spp. (96 P. micra and 4 Parvimonas spp.), in which common focal infections were in the abdominal tract, bones and joints, the respiratory tract, and in skin\/soft tissue, however, oropharyngeal infection were rarely identified [9]. Our case series and literature review indicated that it is necessary to note the GIT, oropharyngeal tract, pulmonary, vertebral spine, intra-abdominal region, and heart valves as infectious sites of P. micra bacteremia. In our cases, 48% (12\/25) of P. micra bacteremia had polymicrobial bacteremia. In the literature cases, 5 patients (18.5%) had polymicrobial bacteremia. Most concomitant pathogens were aerobic and anaerobic members of the oral and gastrointestinal microbiota. Badri et al. showed that 50% of Parvimonas spp. associated bacteremic infections were polymicrobial [9], which was equivalent to our cases. Although there was no difference in the mortality rate between patients with monomicrobial and polymicrobial anaerobic bacteremia [33], it was reported that inappropriate antibiotic selection without attention to the results of anaerobic cultures have serious consequences for patients [34]. Therefore, we should choose the antibiotics targeting identified anaerobic organisms including P. micra. Most cases of P. micra bacteremia in our case series were successfully treated with antibiotics (mortality, 1\/25, 4.0%) (Table \u200b(Table2).2). Median of Pitt bacteremia score was 1, and two of 25 cases were treated in the intensive care unit. In the literature cases, P. micra bacteremia also had a favorable outcome (mortality, 1\/27, 3.7%). In one of the previous cases, a patient died as a consequence of the primary tumor after the completion of antibiotic therapy [21]. In a previous study, in-hospital mortality of GPAC bacteremia including Parvimonas spp. was 10% [9]. In contrast, the overall mortality was as high as 25% in all patients with anaerobic bacteremia [34]. Although P. micra can cause complicated infectious diseases including IE and spondylodiscitis, these results suggest that patients with P. micra bacteremia might have good prognosis following appropriate treatment. There were some limitations to this study. First, we may have missed some cases at our institute as well as previously reported cases due to the retrospective design. Second, the cases in our case series were diagnosed in a single tertiary medical center in Japan; therefore, regional and institutional differences were not considered. Third, different blood culture bottles were used in the two study periods. Although a prior study found no difference in the detection rate of anaerobic bacteremia using Bact\/Alert FN bottles or Bact\/Alert FN plus bottles [35], we cannot rule out the potential impact of our transition from Bact\/Alert FN to Bact\/Alert FA plus bottles on identification. Lastly, the literature review on P. micra bacteremia was dependent on publication biases, making it impossible to address the real prevalence and incidence of P. micra bacteremia in clinical setting."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can P. micra cause?","id":"217-1-4-1","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":483,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"We reported the causative pathogens of GPAs bacteremia identified by MALDI-TOF MS, and findings showed P. micra as the second most frequently identified GPA.

These bacteria do not always multiply in an aerobic organ, such as the lung, and they could be easily overlooked because of the clinical mindset. A 35-year-old pregnant woman was admitted to the emergency department 4 weeks prior to her due date who was exhibiting 5 points on the Glasgow coma scale.

P. micra is not a dominant bacterium in an aerobic environment, and there have been multiple case reports on P. micra-related abdominal infection [1\u20133, 6, 7], spondylodiscitis [8, 9], intracranial infection [2, 10, 11] and bloodstream infection [12\u201315], but we did not find any case reports describing severe pneumonia caused by P. micra. On the other hand, we noticed that P. micra could cause deep infection in the elderly patients or patients who have undergone surgery and cancer therapy exist [11, 12, 14, 16], indicating that immune insufficiency and postoperative stress could be risk factors for this infection. Our patient had no history of immune insufficiency or cancer, so we suspected that stress after surgery was the main risk factor for this atypical pneumonia. In this case, the patient was already in a coma before admission to our ER; hence, aspiration pneumonia caused by bacteria in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract was taken into consideration. We placed the patient on a ventilator because she had no spontaneous breathing or cough reflex; her lung was filled with thick sputum that enlarged the volume of respiratory dead space, creating a partial anaerobic environment for P. micra. After we identified the pathogen with NGS, we used ornidazole to eliminate P. micra and prone position ventilation along with bronchoscopic sputum suction to reduce the volume of respiratory dead space. Once P. micra was eliminated and the partial anaerobic environment was improved, the infection was quickly placed under control. Another bacterium identified by NGS was Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, which is a common cause of ICU-acquired pneumonia, especially among immunocompetent patients. After a series of consultations with the aetiologist, we thought Stenotrophomonas maltophilia might not be the main cause of this pneumonia because the pneumonia still progressed despite the application of a strong antibacterial therapy including moxifloxacin, meropenem and vancomycin. However, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia could still contribute to a co-pathogen according to the NGS results. There were several limitations in this case report. We did not find any bacteria or fungi in blood or sputum culture, and we also did not find P. micra, this could be due to the lack of anaerobic bacteria culture facility in our centre. Second, we did not submit bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for next-generation sequencing (NGS) after ornidazole therapy to confirm whether the P. micra was eradicated due to the expensive cost of this test. The diagnosis of P. micra-related severe pneumonia was determined by the NGS results, the lack of evidence of other common pathogens, and the curative effect of ornidazole therapy. In conclusion, identifying the pathogen is the key factor for treating pneumonia. When bacteriological culturing fails, NGS may play an important role in quick and precise diagnosis."}]},{"title":"Parvimonas micra bacteremia in a patient with colonic carcinoma","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Parvimonas micra is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"217-3-1-1","answers":[{"text":"gram-positive","answer_start":23,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Parvimonas micra cause?","id":"217-3-1-2","answers":[{"text":"bacteremia","answer_start":333,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Parvimonas micra's requirement for oxygen?","id":"217-3-1-3","answers":[{"text":"anaerobe","answer_start":37,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does Parvimonas micra normally exist?","id":"217-3-1-4","answers":[{"text":"gastrointestinal tract","answer_start":94,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Parvimonas micra is a gram-positive anaerobe and a part of the normal commensal flora of the gastrointestinal tract.

It is a part of the normal commensal flora of the gastrointestinal tract, and has been involved in infections of the periodontal area, soft tissue, bone and joints (2, 3). The conditions predisposing to anaerobic bacteremia including Parvimonas may involve malignant neoplasms, immune deficiencies, chronic renal insufficiency, decubitus ulcers, perforated abdominal viscus and appendicitis (4). Our extensive literature search revealed that there has been only two case reports on bacteremia due to Parvimonas micra, one being in a patient with an esophageal tumour (1) and other being after (ERCP) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (5). However, to our best knowledge, Parvimonas bacteremia in a patient with colonic carcinoma has never been reported before. Furthermore, there have been cases reported involving Parvimonas infection of different organs of the body, including, brain meninges (6), joints (3), heart valve (7), liver (8), vertebrae and intervertebral discs (9). Anaerobic cocci are frequently isolated from the blood cultures in the setting of polymicrobial infections, therefore, their clinical role sometimes remains unknown (2). Of late, perhaps because of better microbiological diagnostic techniques 910) such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing or PCR assay (2, 11) and resultantly more documented cases of anaerobic bacteremia and anaerobic infections of the organs of the body, the clinical significance of anaerobic infections is becoming exceedingly important. In addition to the above mentioned conditions predisposing to Parvimonas bacteremia, periodontal disease may also be another predisposing risk factor (1, 12). Unlike the above two referenced cases (1, 50 of Parvimonas bacteremia, our patient neither had periodontal disease nor underwent ERCP, respectively. However, he had colonic carcinoma, yet another time highlighting malignancy as a significant predisposing cause of anaerobic bacteremia. Other factors that might have predisposed our patient to anaerobic bacteremia could be old age and diabetes mellitus. Because of the overall high mortality rate associated with anaerobic bacteremia, patients must be started on antibiotic therapy when the index of suspicion of anaerobic infection is high (13), especially, with the fact that Parvimonas micra is highly susceptible to antibiotics (1). This seems to be true in our case where the patient started improving within a few days of start of antibiotics. Moreover, from the aforementioned case description and discussion, it is reasonable to remark that the patients presenting with fever without any identifiable source of infection and with underlying predisposing risks factors for anaerobic bacteremia, empirical therapy with antibiotics may be started as soon as possible while awaiting for the definite blood culture results. Also, it will not be unreasonable to do work up for malignancy. Considering CT scan of the chest, abdomen, pelvis and endoscopy\/colonoscopy to screen for occult gastrointestinal tract malignancy in its early stages while it is still localized would be very imperative, especially, with the fact that surgical resection is the only curative treatment modality for localized colon cancer. In conclusion Immune deficiency is a risk factor for anaerobic bacteremia. Apart from starting patient on antibiotics without waiting for the results of blood culture and susceptibilities, a thorough search for malignancy should be done when a patient presents with anaerobic bacteremia, especially, when the source of infection is not known. This may potentially aid in identifying malignancy in earliest stages and, therefore, improving the treatment outcome."}]},{"title":"Parvimonas micra as a causative organism of spondylodiscitis: a report of two cases and a literature review","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Parvimonas micra cause?","id":"217-4-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Spondylodiscitis","answer_start":1,"id":1},{"text":"Spondylodiscitis","answer_start":186,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":" Spondylodiscitis caused by Parvimonas micra, a rarely reported infection, might be under-detected using conventional methods.

On initial examination, she was lethargic and confused but her motor, sensory, and cranial nerves were intact. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed a large subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basilar cisterns, bilateral sylvian fissures, and the interhemispheric fissure with hydrocephalus. Subsequently, an external ventricular drain (EVD) was placed. A saccular anterior communicating aneurysm was identified on a CT angiogram of the head, and the patient underwent coil embolization. On day 3 of hospitalization, the patient developed a temperature of 38.1\u00b0C and was diagnosed with an Escherichia coli urinary tract infection for which she was given levofloxacin (750 mg daily) during hospital days 4 to 8. Fevers persisted, however, and on day 5 of hospitalization, a grossly bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimen from the EVD showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 350 \u00d7 10 cells\/liter. CSF Gram stain and culture at that time were negative. Over the next several days, the CSF cell count progressively increased and on the day 9 of hospitalization was 14,000 \u00d7 10 cells\/liter with 80% neutrophils. During the same time period, the CSF glucose level ranged between 59 and 68 mg\/dl (with corresponding plasma glucose levels of 112 to 131 mg\/dl) and protein levels ranged between 159 and 270 mg\/dl. Three CSF cultures obtained with each EVD aspiration during concurrent levofloxacin treatment for urinary tract infection were negative. Given worsening fever, three CSF specimens were sent for culture on hospital days 12 to 14. Each culture was positive for two different Gram-negative rods, which were detected on blood agar, chocolate agar, and MacConkey agar and in thioglycolate broth (Remel, Lenexa, KS) after overnight incubation at 35\u00b0C in 5% CO2.

The oxidase reaction was inconclusive but was ultimately determined to be weakly positive after repeat testing. Biochemical identification and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined on the MicroScan WalkAway Plus (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc., West Sacramento, CA) instrument using MicroScan Breakpoint Combo Panel Type 31 and the PROMPT (3M Company, St. Paul, MN) inoculation system. The isolate was identified as Pseudomonas putida (probability 99.2%).

The identification was returned as P. putida but with a low confidence value of 81.9. On the Microflex LT instrument, the isolate was tested in duplicate, with and without formic acid pretreatment, using flexControl and flexAnalysis (Compass 1.4) and BioTyper (version 3.1) software. Reliable identification as Pseudomonas fulva was obtained under both conditions with scores of 1.970 and 1.870 using matrix only and scores of 2.212 and 2.118 with formic acid pretreatment. To further resolve the identification, PCR amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was performed by the Georgia Public Health Laboratory using the ABI 3130xl genetic analyzer (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). The sequencer internal library generated an identification of Pseudomonas fulva (99.92% sequence homology with P. fulva GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"FJ972539\",\"term_id\":\"238814987\",\"term_text\":\"FJ972539\"}}FJ972539). The next closest match was to Pseudomonas straminea (98.63%). Because the species match to P. fulva was >99% and the separation from the next most similar species was greater than 0.8%, the identification as P. fulva was considered definitive (1). An identification of P. putida was not presented as an option by the sequencer for this isolate. When the obtained sequence was applied to a GenBank search, the first identification was P. fulva, with a 99% similarity match to type strain P. fulva NRIC 0180 with 3 mismatches in 482 bp. The next nearest species match was to Pseudomonas fluorescens. Even though the percentages for both identifications were 99%, the total score for P. fulva was 8 points greater than for P. fluorescens. The nearest match to any reference or type strain of P. putida using BLAST was 97% to P. putida strain KT2440. Biochemical characterization using the Biolog OmniLog identification system (Biolog, Inc., Haywood CA) and GEN III MicroPlate was done in triplicate and resulted in a metabolic fingerprint consistent with an identification of P. fulva with probabilities of 77% (excellent identification), 56%, and 55% (good identification). No other species met the 50% probability required for acceptable species identification. Additional tests showed that the isolate failed to grow at 42\u00b0C and did not fluoresce when examined under UV light from a Wood's lamp. The P. fulva isolate was susceptible to all antibiotics tested: amikacin, aztreonam, cefepime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, levofloxacin, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and tobramycin. Of the antibiotics tested, the E. cloacae isolate was resistant only to ampicillin. After initial positive CSF cultures, the patient was started on intravenous (i.v.) levofloxacin (750 mg i.v. daily) and rifampin (600 mg i.v. daily) while awaiting final species identification. The fevers resolved, the CSF WBC count improved, the EVD was removed, and rifampin was discontinued on the third day of this regimen. The patient completed an additional 16 days of oral levofloxacin (750 mg per day). The patient remained afebrile and was without evidence of recurrence in follow-up approximately 1 month after completion of antibiotic therapy. P. fulva is a Gram-negative rod that was initially grouped with other plant-inhabiting Pseudomonas species that also produce a yellow pigment. The classification was revised based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, and P. fulva is now phylogenetically located in the P. putida group, which also includes Pseudomonas monteilii, Pseudomonas mosselii, Pseudomonas oryzihabitans, Pseudomonas plecoglossicida, and P. putida (2). P. fulva cells measure 0.6 to 0.8 by 1.4 to 1 \u03bcm, have rounded ends, and are motile with polar flagella. Growth occurs at temperatures between 4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, but P. fulva does not grow at 41\u00b0C. Typically, P. fulva colonies are smooth and wet. Although catalase and oxidase are produced, the oxidase reaction has been described as weakly positive (3, 4). As with other Pseudomonas species, metabolism is strictly aerobic. Key biochemical characteristics include production of arginine dihydrolase and lack of reduction of nitrate to nitrite. In contrast to its closely related species, P. fulva produces a water-insoluble yellow pigment and does not assimilate malonate or m-hydroxybenzoate while P. putida produces a water-soluble fluorescent pigment and does assimilate the two compounds. While P. fulva has been identified mainly in natural environments, including rice and petroleum fields from which it was initially isolated (5), few cases of P. fulva infection in human have been documented. Thus far, two previous cases have highlighted findings of P. fulva in human CSF and bloodstream. Comparing these two reports with our own finding revealed important similarities that support our conclusion and nuances in the presenting characteristics that highlight the complexity of P. fulva as an emerging infection. Similar to the two previous reported human cases of P. fulva, the initial identification efforts misidentified the organism as P. putida. Almuzara et al. relied on the Vitek 2 system and API 20 NE, both of which indicated the presence of P. putida (4). Similarly, Seok et al. also originally identified their isolate as P. putida by using the Vitek 2 and ID 32 systems (3). Our specimen was subjected to the MicroScan WalkAway Plus Neg Breakpoint Combo Panel Type 41, API 20 NE, and Vitek MS, and all three systems led to P. putida identification. Consistent with the initial identifications in the CSF and bloodstream cases, which had relatively high probabilities of identification of P. putida ranging from 99.0% on the Vitek2 system in the report by Seok et al. to 99.9% from the ID 32 GN system, biochemical testing of our isolate on the MicroScan (99.2%) and API 20 NE (98.2%) also produced high probabilities. We postulate that the initial identifications of our isolate may have suggested P. putida due to limited distinguishing biochemicals on the panels and a database content not inclusive of P. fulva. The API 20 NE strip does not contain any biochemicals that distinguish P. putida from P. fulva, and the MicroScan panel contains three distinguishing biochemicals, inositol, sucrose, and malonate, none of which are assimilated by P. fulva, and the panel gave the expected negative reactions. The Vitek MS does not have P. fulva mass spectra in the reference database and generated an identification of P. putida, but with a probability of only 81.9%. Similar to the other two cases, we questioned the identification of P. putida due to the inconsistent phenotypic and biochemical characterization of the isolates with the typical P. putida features. Colonies from all three reports were brownish yellow in color, due to production of a water-insoluble pigment, which more closely resembled P. fulva. The isolates were arginine dihydrolase positive, and further substrate utilization profiles showed that the isolates were malonate negative. Similar to our observation of no growth of our isolate at elevated temperatures, the isolates reported by both Seok et al. and Almuzara et al. also did not grow at 41\u00b0C (2, 3). These characteristics were consistent with the identification by Uchino et al. of P. fulva (2). In considering oxidase tests, the CSF specimen isolated by Seok et al. (3) was oxidase negative while the bloodstream isolate in the study by Almuzara et al. (4) was found to be weakly oxidase positive, similar to our isolate. As these characterizations further suggest greater consistency with identification of P. fulva, subsequent verification using the more reliable 16S rRNA gene sequencing method in all three cases corroborated the findings by showing that all three isolates had the highest identity with P. fulva. Further comparisons of antibiotic profiles of the three isolated samples revealed subtle differences, which highlighted the potential variability in P. fulva susceptibility. In the Seok et al. case report (3), the organism was susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, aztreonam, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. However, it demonstrated resistance to chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole when tested by the Etest (3). Our own strain showed a susceptibility profile similar to that of Seok et al. In contrast, the isolate from the report of Almuzara et al. showed susceptibility to cefepime, cefepime plus lithium clavulanate, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and colistin but resistance to ceftazidime, ceftazidime plus lithium clavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, meropenem, and gentamicin. Further assessment with EDTA-sodium mercaptoacetic acid (EDTA-SMA) double-disk assays was performed with imipenem and meropenem, to which the P. fulva strain tested susceptible, thus indicating the possible presence of metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (MBL). Additional PCR amplification studies showed that the P. fulva isolate did indeed contain the blaVIM gene (4). Integration of the MBL cassette into this isolate raises the concern of possible transmission of these resistance-inducing cassettes across different Pseudomonas species, including P. fulva. Although P. fulva has traditionally been described within the context of rice and petroleum fields, studies have shown a broad range of environments in which the organism can survive. In a study designed to collect samples from 80 \u201chabitat types\u201d that represented a diversity of microenvironments ranging from vertebrate skin to bathroom counter surfaces in 20 households, P. fulva was among the four most commonly encountered Pseudomonas species (6). Since P. fulva is commonly found in the environment, there is potential for it to be identified from clinical specimens. As the P. fulva in the present study was isolated concomitantly with Enterobacter cloacae, there is strong reason to believe that the P. fulva was hospital acquired. Our case further highlights the possible emergence of P. fulva in the hospital setting and the need for circumspect diagnosis in the setting of phenotypic and biochemical inconsistencies with automated identification."},{"qas":[{"question":"Whether P. fulva is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"222-1-3-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":7112,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about P. fulva's requirement for oxygen?","id":"222-1-3-2","answers":[{"text":"strictly aerobic","answer_start":7917,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the shape of P. fulva?","id":"222-1-3-3","answers":[{"text":"rod","answer_start":7126,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where does P. fulva normally exist?","id":"222-1-3-4","answers":[{"text":"natural environments, including rice and petroleum fields","answer_start":8349,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are P. fulva resistant to?","id":"222-1-3-5","answers":[{"text":"chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole","answer_start":12108,"id":1},{"text":"ceftazidime, ceftazidime plus lithium clavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, meropenem, and gentamicin","answer_start":12452,"id":2}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of drugs are P. fulva sensitive to?","id":"222-1-3-6","answers":[{"text":"all antibiotics tested: amikacin, aztreonam, cefepime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, levofloxacin, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and tobramycin","answer_start":6313,"id":1},{"text":"piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, aztreonam, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and levofloxacin","answer_start":11925,"id":2},{"text":"cefepime, cefepime plus lithium clavulanate, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and colistin","answer_start":12351,"id":3}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"A 55-year-old woman with a history of chronic migraines and hypertension was transferred to Emory University Hospital for management of a spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient complained of 1 week of worsening migraine headaches but denied nausea, vomiting, and neurologic disturbances until the day of admission, when she developed generalized paresthesia and progressive decline in the level of consciousness. On initial examination, she was lethargic and confused but her motor, sensory, and cranial nerves were intact. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed a large subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basilar cisterns, bilateral sylvian fissures, and the interhemispheric fissure with hydrocephalus. Subsequently, an external ventricular drain (EVD) was placed. A saccular anterior communicating aneurysm was identified on a CT angiogram of the head, and the patient underwent coil embolization. On day 3 of hospitalization, the patient developed a temperature of 38.1\u00b0C and was diagnosed with an Escherichia coli urinary tract infection for which she was given levofloxacin (750 mg daily) during hospital days 4 to 8. Fevers persisted, however, and on day 5 of hospitalization, a grossly bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimen from the EVD showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 350 \u00d7 10 cells\/liter. CSF Gram stain and culture at that time were negative. Over the next several days, the CSF cell count progressively increased and on the day 9 of hospitalization was 14,000 \u00d7 10 cells\/liter with 80% neutrophils. During the same time period, the CSF glucose level ranged between 59 and 68 mg\/dl (with corresponding plasma glucose levels of 112 to 131 mg\/dl) and protein levels ranged between 159 and 270 mg\/dl. Three CSF cultures obtained with each EVD aspiration during concurrent levofloxacin treatment for urinary tract infection were negative. Given worsening fever, three CSF specimens were sent for culture on hospital days 12 to 14. Each culture was positive for two different Gram-negative rods, which were detected on blood agar, chocolate agar, and MacConkey agar and in thioglycolate broth (Remel, Lenexa, KS) after overnight incubation at 35\u00b0C in 5% CO2. The first organism was present in a lower quantity than the second (2+ [moderate] in the first two cultures and 1+ [few] in the third) and was identified as Enterobacter cloacae. The other organism was present in high quantity (4+ [many]) in all three cultures, was a lactose nonfermenter, and formed smooth, wet colonies with a yellow nondiffusible pigment (Fig. 1). The oxidase reaction was inconclusive but was ultimately determined to be weakly positive after repeat testing. Biochemical identification and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined on the MicroScan WalkAway Plus (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc., West Sacramento, CA) instrument using MicroScan Breakpoint Combo Panel Type 31 and the PROMPT (3M Company, St. Paul, MN) inoculation system. The isolate was identified as Pseudomonas putida (probability 99.2%). However, since the yellow pigment of the colonies was not consistent with the identification of P. putida, identification using other systems was attempted. Smooth, wet colonies with yellow nondiffusible pigment growing on a blood agar plate after overnight incubation. The isolate was identified by the API 20 NE (bioM\u00e9rieux, Durham, NC) identification strip as P. putida (98.2% probability, biocode 0142455).

This species was first described in 1963 [1], but recently seven of these strains were recharacterized [6]. These bacilli produce a yellow but no fluorescent pigment and also produce arginine hydrolysis and catalase [6]. Oxidase activity is variable, being positive in three cases described by Uchino et al. [6], in one case described by Seok et al. [4], and in our case. In only an isolate described by Almuzara et al., oxidase test was negative [3]. The variable oxidase reaction may be a phenotypic characteristic of this species and, like in Aeromonas, may be negative if performed on strains from differential media such as MacConkey agar but positive if performed on strains from nondifferential media [7]. In blood agar, these strains are small, round, and yellowish.  P. fulva is mainly isolated from environmental sources, above all rice paddies, and rarely affects humans. Until now, only three cases of P. fulva have been reported in the medical literature. One case was isolated from sputum in a patient with cystic fibrosis [8], but the clinical significance of this report was not definitively clarifying. However, the remaining two cases had clinical significance. In 2010, Almuzara et al. [3] reported the first case of human infection due to P. fulva in a 2-year-old female with acute meningitis after placement of shunt system. The isolate shows a VIM-2 carbapanemase production and the patient was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam, colistin, and ciprofloxacin. At the same year, Seok et al. [4] reported a case of bacteremia due to this bacterium in a patient hospitalized due to a trauma. This patient was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin with satisfactory outcome. Due to its rarity, treatment of choice to P. fulva has not been established, so susceptibility testing to the isolates should be performed in order to give the correct therapy. Moreover, care should be taken because this species may acquire resistance genes such as carbapenemases [3].

Alveolar bone resorption is one of the most important factors in denture construction. Porphyromonas gingivalis causes alveolar bone resorption and morphologic measurements are the most frequent methods to identify bone resorption in periodontal studies [57]. The microbiota of the human oral mucosa consists of a myriad of bacterial species that normally exist in commensal harmony with the host. Porphyromonas gingivalis, an etiological agent in severe forms of periodontitis (a chronic inflammatory disease), is a prominent component of the oral microbiome and a successful colonizer of the oral epithelium [59].  Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide circulates systemically in over 50% of periodontal disease patients and is associated with increased matrix metalloproteinase. The low systemic lipopolysaccharide stimulates an inflammatory response in the left ventricle through metalloproteinase leading to a decrease in cardiac function [60]. In the outer membrane, vesicles of Porphyromonas gingivalis contain virulence factors such as lipopolysaccharide and gingipains. The sera from periodontitis patients had significantly stronger reactivity against an outer membrane vesicles-producing strain than the isogenic outer membrane vesicles-depleted strain. The gingipain-laden outer membrane vesicles may contribute to tissue destruction in periodontal diseases by serving as a vehicle for the antigens and active proteases [61]. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans can be transmitted from family member to family member and may cause periodontitis in the recipient individual [40]. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathomechanisms of Porphyromonas gingivalis may lead to the development of novel strategies for eradication of Porphyromonas gingivalis and treatment for periodontal diseases in the future. The past decades of biomedical research have yielded massive evidence for the contribution of the microbiome in the development of a variety of chronic human diseases. There is emerging evidence that Porphyromonas gingivalis, a well-adapted opportunistic pathogen of the oral mucosa and prominent constituent of oral biofilms, best known for its involvement in periodontitis, may be an important mediator in the development of a number of multifactorial and seemingly unrelated chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and orodigestive cancers. Orodigestive cancers represent a large proportion of the total malignancies worldwide and include cancers of the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas. For prevention and\/or enhanced prognosis of these diseases, a good understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms and the interaction between Porphyromonas gingivalis and host is much needed [62].   Porphyromonas gingivalis, an etiological agent in severe forms of periodontitis, is a prominent component of the oral microbiome and a successful colonizer of the oral epithelium. This Gram-negative anaerobe can also exist within the host epithelium without the existence of overt disease. Porphyromonas gingivalis seems to be a highly adapted pathogen of the oral microbiome. The latest studies tend to focus on the research of its possible direct and indirect influence on certain systemic diseases such as atherosclerosis and reumatoid arthritis. Mutual relations between Porphyromonas gingivalis and other pathogens of the oral cavity are another subject of intensive studies. The authors have used both latest as well as older reviews and studies to compile a comprehensive overview of this key periodontal pathogen."}]},{"title":"Porphyromonas gingivalis: An Overview of Periodontopathic Pathogen below the Gum Line","context":[{"qas":[{"question":"Whether Porphyromonas gingivalis is gram-positive or gram-negative?","id":"224-2-1-1","answers":[{"text":"Gram-negative","answer_start":566,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kinds of diseases can Porphyromonas gingivalis cause?","id":"224-2-1-2","answers":[{"text":"chronic periodontitis","answer_start":651,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How about Porphyromonas gingivalis's requirement for oxygen?","id":"224-2-1-3","answers":[{"text":"anaerobic","answer_start":580,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Periodontal disease represents a group of oral inflammatory infections initiated by oral pathogens which exist as a complex biofilms on the tooth surface and cause destruction to tooth supporting tissues.

While human subgingival plaque harbors more than 500 bacterial species, considerable research has shown that Porphyromonas gingivalis, a Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium, is the major etiologic agent which contributes to chronic periodontitis.

The disease begins as acute inflammation of the gingival tissue and untreated infections can progress to formation of teeth pockets, and eventually loss of teeth. According to the World Health Organization, periodontal disease affects 10\u201315% of adult populations worldwide (Petersen and Ogawa, 2012). Substantial data accumulated over the years has implicated the involvement of only a small proportion of bacteria, which reside in the subgingival niche, in the initiation and progression of periodontal disease. There is strong evidence that points to Porphyromonas gingivalis, a Gram-negative anaerobes, as the keystone species in the development of chronic periodontitis. The past decades of extensive research on P. gingivalis have produced various lines of evidences on the contribution of this anaerobe to the progression of periondontal disease. These findings are important in increasing our understanding on the virulence characteristics and cellular interaction between P. gingivalis and the host, thereby elucidating potential therapeutic approaches to control periodontal disease progression."},{"qas":[{"question":"What kinds of diseases can P. gingivalis cause?","id":"224-2-3-1","answers":[{"text":"chronic periodontitis","answer_start":81,"id":1}],"is_impossible":false}],"content":"Taken together, P. gingivalis is a major etiological agent in the development of chronic periodontitis. This secondary colonizer is found to express a plethora of virulence factors involved in colonizing the subgingival plaque and modulating the immune responses of the host cells. In order to increase survival into the host, P. gingivalis is able to locally invade periondontal tissue, thereby avoiding the immune surveillance while maintaining its viability. Each virulence factor plays important roles to hamper the cell-mediated immune response in host. Nevertheless, in spite of the convincing data presented in this study, it should be cautioned that in an actual in vivo situation, the bacteria express a whole subset of virulence factors that may interact with and stimulate host cells in a different way than a single virulence factor. In addition, periodontal disease is rarely the result of single bacteria. Hence, P. gingivalis is likely to work with other oral microbiota to thrive in a harsh inflammatory condition in periodontal pocket. To date, numerous studies have been done to elucidate the mechanism of virulence compounds secreted by P. gingivalis and the cellular interaction with the host. Improved understanding of the interaction between periodontal bacteria and host cells at the molecular and cellular level, may ultimately have relevance to the overall well-being of the host. In recent years, the use of natural compounds has gained more attention to attenuate the action of P. gingivalis. Plant-derived natural products have been widely explored as the therapeutic roles in regulating interactions between microorganisms. One of the appealing therapeutic feature is bioactive compounds from plants appear to be safe and should not cause toxicity toward human cells. However, a comprehensive toxicity studies on these compounds are still deemed necessary. With tremendous progress in biomedical studies, we expect to eventually elucidate the possible unique mechanism of P. gingivalis and its virulence determinants. Exploration of this field will be of help in the development of effective therapies for controlling bacterial-induced connective tissue destruction. These therapeutics approaches may be important in controlling chronic P. gingivalis infections by preventing growth and colonization of P. gingivalis."}]}]}]}
